Baghdad's Thief is one of my ten favorite favorite movies. It's exciting without gore, it's beautifully busy and the art direction is flawless. The molding couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the figure of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as a jealous one. He put the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I see this movie at least twice a year ... and never tired of it. This movie is an adventure for all ages .. no one too old to enjoy. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories for a more innocent time ... I was ten years old the first time I saw it, and the United States was about to enter the Second World War. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he could continue this underlying "evil" a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda teamed up with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" .... great movie production!
