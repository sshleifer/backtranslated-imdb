"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on cable. Not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on James Van Drut's Broadway hit, which was a tool for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 50s, the movie was adapted to the screen of Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who made the game a great comedy. Although judging from some of the comments from IMDb, the big problem seems to be the mating of the two stars who had collaborated on "Vertigo" released that year. The movie audience did not think about the age difference when this film was released. In fact, most of the aging men's stars in that period were always involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie in Manhattan at Christmas is a wonderful comedy that has enchanting viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty, as it is clear that the camera offered her whatever she played. As the witch becomes human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also seen at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor showing here why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> As entertaining roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie she proves here. Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the author Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
