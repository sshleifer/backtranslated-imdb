After watching this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first made in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements in the RINGU series, especially the idea of ​​the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the damned video tape, we instead have a haunted study and strange images that appear on film. In fact, the strange images displayed on film immediately bring the damn video tape into RINGU to mind. The only thing missing was occupation of water running through Nakata's later film. The final scenes are quite chilling, with a little nod to Murnau, what about the door opening by itself and the ghost into the room reminds me immediately of <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A chilling movie that will do is think twice about going up to a catwalk.
