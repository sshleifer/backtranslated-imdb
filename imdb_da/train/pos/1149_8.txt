Fast and fun satire about the original "reality TV", the soap opera. The script of playwright Robert Harling is full of lines and ridiculous situations. The best of them is climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into poor improvisation and brain transplantation. Keven Kline's murder on his lines because he is not wearing the glasses is fun. "Her brain will later examine in the next few houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a pleasure to see a cast click as it does in this movie. This is a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. The result of Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with the flamboyant and melodramatic air.
