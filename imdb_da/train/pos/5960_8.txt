It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she will smile a lot. Also loved hearing her sing. Good change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The movie itself was entertaining, but it seemed to skip an explanation in many parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next, and it was up to the imagination to find out why. Each character was quirky, but in some cases I couldn't wait to see what they were going to do next or hear what they would say next. This movie was not full of appalling clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to correct them.
