I can't remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it six years ago and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I will admit that you will probably despise this movie if you don't know about rap music. But if you are a rap fan, even a casual, you will love the inside jokes and references. One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played Nerd Lamar in the "Nerd Revenge". It is unfortunate that this movie probably never gets a DVD release.
