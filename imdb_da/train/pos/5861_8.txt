Overall, I totally agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel that I don't even have to comment as it is so much a veterinary movie and I'm not a veterinarian (I was an opponent). The lack is that Martha is poorly underdeveloped and does not act consistently. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian himself and spent too little planning time on her character.
