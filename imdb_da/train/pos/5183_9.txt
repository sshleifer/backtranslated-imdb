<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it in college in the early 90s, and while I couldn't identify with the thirty thousand in the movie, I felt that the story, the characters, and the film were generally top notch. For those who spoke negatively about the Indian summer, feel free to stick to your blown Armageddon movies and let the movies with a good and healthy story for those who appreciate them.
