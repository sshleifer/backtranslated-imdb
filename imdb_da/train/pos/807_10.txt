Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> The final struggle between rebellion and empire. The other death star is approaching completion, and when it is finished, it will spell dead for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to attack the Shield generator on the Forest Moon in Endor, while Lando Calrissian attacks the Death Star. Little do they know that there is a most ingenious trap for them, and Emperor Palpatine himself monitors the construction of the second death star. <br /> <br /> Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great fighting, amazing acting, amazing fighting scenes and great music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now in a Jedi Knight, away is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a quiet, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie have their roles as a T, while James Earl Jones is still the movie's biggest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain like the twisted and brutally reckless Emperor Palpatine. The action movies in this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fighting is serious and gritty. John Williams score is still cool and enhances the movie at several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
