Very nicely finished film. It stays in your memory. Better billed as a romance than flying or war, though the flying parts are realistic and almost flawless. Flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie, even if they are attracted to the aircraft, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun looks early Crowe. He is good and exudes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is amazing. Bowl, Boom
