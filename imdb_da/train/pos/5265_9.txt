I remember seeing this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I would be one of the "barbaric brothers". This movie is still great. An original aspect was that the scenes of the battle were very short. It means that the "barbarian brothers" where so good that they are finished there enemies quickly! Plus, you have chases, a can of fight, a dragon, and even a bar brawl! <br /> <br /> Yes, the play is bad, so it's not a ten, also the story has received a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty original. Not too many movies in their genre have the same original stories or colorful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
