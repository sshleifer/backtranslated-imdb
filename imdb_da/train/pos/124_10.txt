* Contains spoilers because I have to describe some movie techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. Using color in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph that comes to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a rear screen. For example, in a scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is big in the back, and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with face close-ups. It reminded me of the battleship Potemkin, the intense constant style combined with the red spray to convey tons of horror without much to do. Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub ... you can only see the red water on the side. It's one of the things I love about Von Trier, his horror suppression, which ends up making it more crazy. <br /> <br /> The use of text in the film was unique, as Leo's character is pushed by the word "werewolf". I've never seen anything like this in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is fantastic as Leo's uncle. It brings the snickers I got from his role in the kingdom. This humor makes the plot line of absurd anal retentivity of the train leaders towards WW2's awful background and all the chaos easier to take. It reminds me of the Kingdom in the way the hospital administrator tries to maintain a normality at the end of Part 1 when everything goes crazy. It shows that some people are really ignorant of the terrible things happening around them. But some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it. <br /> <br /> The voice over which is professionally done by Max von Sydow is also fun. It pulls you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a scary place to be. <br /> <br /> The movie brings the point that you are a sweep if they don't choose a page. I see the same idea used in the dancer in the dark, where Bjork's character does not speak for himself and end up being his own destruction. In fact, Von Trier once seemed to be a woman for me by doing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters are not doing well either! I found myself in the same place at the end of the dancer when you seriously want the protagonist to rethink their actions, but of course they never do!
