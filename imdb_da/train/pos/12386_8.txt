'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie Industry! I think it's very scary because very few movies are actually. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. She dates a lawyer called Michael Lerman and, as a best friend, has another model called Jennifer. Everything was fantastic in her life until she decided to stay alone for a while and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is her neighbors who are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to have health problems and falls with frequency; She also remembers some painful facts about her past that cause her to have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and it has to do with the new house she lives ... I personally find "The Sentinel" a very creepy movie, and along with "The Exorcist" they are two of the scariest movies I've already seen. When we discover that Alison's house is only occupied by the priest and himself froze my blood! It is also terrible to see that she becomes blind at the end of the movie to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.
