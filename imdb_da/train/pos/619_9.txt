I expected this movie to be decent and possibly clich√©, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him so far) played an incredibly good lead man; he was so serious and romantic, me and my friend, who watched the movie with me, fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I liked earlier (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more. Her plays were amazing, I couldn't even tell she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was pretty perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally cast; DeNiro as the gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard at one scene where Septimus comes on the ship ... Oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her like the slung mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and carved comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was fun (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't quite frequent, but when they were, they were great; cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well-placed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like Princess Bride or even the Lord of the Rings. It kept my interest all the time and I want to buy the DVD when it comes out!
