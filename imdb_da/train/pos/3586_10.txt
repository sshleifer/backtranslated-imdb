I saw the first, as it was premiered more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. She fought alone is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who was raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who enjoys damaging girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school clip, but when she reveals she is raped, Clique turns to her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film crowns Caitlin's struggle against a whole city, including a gymnasium that essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment so that they can get away with what they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best performers and there is real chemistry between the two throughout the film. All the actors in this movie, inspired by current events, did a good job. She fought alone, really capturing the essence of how it is to be in high school (at least in 1995) and having one's self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10.10
