I came across an insomniacs nightmare while I was looking for offbeat independent movies, and happy to say it did not disappoint. This crazy half hour trip had made me wonder all the way through, and the end was excellent - one of the exact moments that really stays with you. I've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree on hands down. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She crawled her heel out of me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a good job with this. All the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. So well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the movie. The management was great and the play was fun, but the most important factor here is the strength of the manuscript. Good work for this girl, I can't wait to see more!
