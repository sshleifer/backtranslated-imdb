FREDDY has gone from scary to fun, in this 6th part of the nightmare series. It has been 2 years, yes actually 11 since this movie takes place in 2001. And FREDDY has killed every last child on Elm street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from part 5, even making the film on whoever he is), where he uses to get more children to come to Elm street.Not get FREDDY only his wishes, but he also gets his daughter back to Elm street.When she finds out what is happening, she and other children decide to kill the peace dune an Once and for all, we will also see some of Freddy's creepy backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been coherent with the nightmare series for a long time. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. It tried to highlight what FREDDY did with its wisecrackes ... COMDEY and makes the series more fun than scary. So this movie is really a comdey wound to speak. It's not wrost in the series, part 2 still keeps it. <br /> <br />
