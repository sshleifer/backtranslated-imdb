The world is a terrible place. But this movie is farce and it's fun. And if you don't like it ... you don't get it ... and if you don't ... it doesn't matter. It's up to you if you want to play together. Every actor in this had fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is invaluable. Byrne and Paul Anka do MIT WAY is, as "Vic" puts it, "... the best version ever". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned against seeing it, but I'm sure I did it ...
