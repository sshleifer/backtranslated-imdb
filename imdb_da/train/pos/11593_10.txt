I remembered watching this movie when I was a kid at Disney's wonderful world. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I've been looking for it. I had to put it out of all the kids I looked back when, "he stuck out more than all of them, and after only seeing it once, I really hoped I would see it again. The story and the pictures of this movie have been burned in my memory. To this day I have never seen it after the day back in the 70s, in fact I never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today revealed it to me. I loved it and want my kids to see it. Does anyone know where to find it?
