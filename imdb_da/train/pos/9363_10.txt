This movie was great, it's the kind of movie you see it, and rather than watching other movies of actor you watch other director / writer movies. Sandler did a good job working a sign outside his comfort zone, and the always good Cheadle also did a good job. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. The action was amazing and can only be surpassed by writing and controlling the movie. This film focuses on the real Americans, the past generation, no stereotypes or racism, just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This movie is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it defines it, not as a person who heals you magically, but rather through the necessity to speak your sentiment to an impartial person whom you can trust, will not judge you but will rather lead yourself about your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
