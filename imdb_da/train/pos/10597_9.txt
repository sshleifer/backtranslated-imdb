I offer pictures that try something else. Many movies just look like they are starting with old ideas, so that's the big reason I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The movie is set just after World War II and the post-war deficiencies and rationing seem to run London's "barmy". The film is centered on a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They are also ill for not being able to buy what they want, but can't see any way out of it. It is until they unfortunately stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter that officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! With this document, the reasons they can bypass all rationing and coupons and live life the way they want, as it turns out they really aren't British subjects! Where the film goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you must see for yourself. Let it be in Ealing Studios brilliant mind to come up with this gem!
