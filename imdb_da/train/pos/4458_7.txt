This has some good spots, but the length of the film cannot maintain the wafer thin plot. It's another sailors on leave movies, zippies than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On the Town'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their "If You Did Know Susie's Number Is Fun" as they make up the song while they sing it. 'I confess her' is also fun with Sinatra, showing how talented he was on heads. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be deployed to show their song rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, supporting actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton have been achieved and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself to keep one looking. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the movie, although third picture and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the Navy and is locked to the Kelly character. He also visits a school that results in his children telling a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian (!) Marine leading to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances a charming Mexican hat dance with a sublime coarse face little girl, Sharon McManus, who is entrancing and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very comfortable but a little too long. A taste of better musicals to come.
