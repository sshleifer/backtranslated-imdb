Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based on the long running radio line (which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a nice dashing figure and it is sad that he got No more roles where he could be the guy on command in a good way. Here, Chandu returns from the east to help the princess Nadji, hunted by the leaders of the Ubasti cult, who need her to bring the high priest of their cult from the dead. This is a good looking globe trot series that is a lot of fun. To be sure the pacing is a bit lax, more akin to one of the Principals (the producing studios), then it's a rip roaring adventure, but it's still fun. This plays better than the two feature films that were cut off because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling upset or feeling "hi I missed something". One of the trilogy of three good series made Lugosi, the others are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
