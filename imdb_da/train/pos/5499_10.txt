I had no idea of ​​the facts presented by this film. When I remember this situation, I accepted the information provided in the media: A confused event about a questionable personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if any of this caliber has ever been made. I assumed the main character was Mr. Chavez, but everyone came up in the picture <br /> <br /> were important, and in the end the reality of the entelechy: the people were overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
