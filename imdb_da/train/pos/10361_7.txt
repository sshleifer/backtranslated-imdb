Once you have chosen your jaw from the floor from the realization that they ... somehow managed to put this thing together so quickly that it was released the same year that the case ended, you will find that it is not is half bad. The plot is engaging and interesting, and pacing is quick, with this many situations and therefore often jumps quickly to the next after a line or two have been spoken. Where this really stands out is the actor. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood movie, and even those who don't come naturally to it, at least try an accent. Cinematography and editing are good enough, but they do not go beyond the normal things. The film's story is convincing, and the fact that it is authentic makes it just more chilling. While I haven't read the novel or heard about what happened outside this picture, I understand it's pretty close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disruptive content in this. It is sometimes a fairly large courtroom drama. I recommend it to any other fan of that. 10.7
