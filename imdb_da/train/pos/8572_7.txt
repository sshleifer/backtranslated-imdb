The first movie was a nice one, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classic I found more exciting and endearing. This successor is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure that slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a bit uninspired. But the dogs are very sweet here, and Eric Idle is fun as the macaw. The movie is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye-catching costumes (especially Cruella's), and the music is comfortable. The action is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing, and Gerard Depardieu, while giving better performances, has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first movie, is the stunning Glenn Close in a delicious over-the-top performance like Cruella, even more evil than before. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
