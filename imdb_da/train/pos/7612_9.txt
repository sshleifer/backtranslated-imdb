OK, I'll be honest when I first saw the trailer for the program, I thought it was an ad for some sunscreen product. With all the people walking around the beach. Despite this, I decided to watch it and thought it would be a new show I could laugh at. But I was seriously amazed. From the first 10 seconds of the program I was connected, why is he in the trees, why has the plane crashed etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> It's not every day that a show comes together that combines intelligence, humor, action and excitement. But 'Lost' manages all this. With a great cast and crew, beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects, 'Lost' will capture everyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone who is bad on cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost is on Tuesdays at 10am on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
