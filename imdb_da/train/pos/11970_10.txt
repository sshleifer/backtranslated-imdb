Full house came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing overthrows of America's full-fledged home movies with Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me he was also in a show called Full House. One day I was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family. It didn't seem too interesting at first, but when I saw more and more, ever evening at. At 9:00 am, I would just agree with that. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you hang out with the girls, join them and maybe even join their little family "sing-alongs". What I like most about Full House is that it is a good show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some sections that are more for adults, so parts designed for kids so the whole family will enjoy it. No matter how cheesy it may be, it's still a good show and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
