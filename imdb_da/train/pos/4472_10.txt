Right from the start you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutest children's actor I've never seen. If you love piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animation with real actors, and it made it wonderful in an unforgettable dance. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
