Min, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a fair looking woman. This movie is a lost gem, a dead-satire "mockumentary" in the early 90's Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer had just begun to fade away in the good evening. We follow the three members of the NWH as they begin their picaresque journey of will-be wealth and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best movies that no one has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you either love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this regard. I consider this movie as the 1000 islands upstate New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep yourself.
