This film was an excellent concept. It was original, wisely written and of high appeal to those of us who are not really 'conformist' movie voters. Don't make me wrong - there are some great movies that have great appeal, but when you go into watching a movie based on "everyone else sees it" - you know you're either a tween or don't really have a meaning. This had a lovely subtle humor - despite the fact that most people probably only look at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb, and I thought there was much more "personal" personality in this movie. Have appeal to children as well as adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and medication! A great movie, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.
