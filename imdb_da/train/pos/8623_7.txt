DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit films - but is still an interesting film dealing with suicide, and it's causes and ramifications. Those looking for a gore party or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM are likely to be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an "art house" style film, so those who need linear, explanatory narratives do not have to use ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept THAT BECAUSE is that there is a " episode "for every day of the week, which is about a strange chain letter, which apparently causes people to commit suicide, mixed with scenes of a slow-breaking body ... There are some very well-finished and thought-provoking scenes, including the man who talked about the "problems" with his wife and concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of the "power" to me because I was too busy laughing at SCORPION's serial match on stage ...). But seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful (the scene showing different angles of the great bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people who actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge. ..), sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid (SHE WOLF OF SS rip-off is pretty entertaining), sometimes harrowing (I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife's particularly effective) movies that are more of an "experience" than just entertainment, which many of these "art" films are meant to be. Still, I did not find THEM to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and would probably put it on relatively equal footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 with regard to my personal "pleasure level". Definitely worth looking at any Buttgereit or "art" movie fan. If you dig this type of movie - check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the best art house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
