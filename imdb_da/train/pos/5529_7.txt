I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year ago. It came and went with a little fanfare, but I enjoyed it for the beautiful landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife material. (The story, while it's lovely, is really random. If you actually thought about it, there's no way most of what can happen can happen in real life.) I saw it again tonight, here in the US , on DVD. Again, I collect it has very limited distribution. Blockbusters only had one copy of it, and I can't remember ever playing in art galleries in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> Looking at my TV, photography is not so breathtaking, though still very beautiful. Wildlife footage is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time when you know where it is going. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, history is random. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, you should find this fascinating.
