Whatever you stay in your life, never forget that you have roots. This is the story of true facts made for a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say this movie is undervalued. This shows us a reality in life ... the more evil you surround, the better you become. Trust your instincts and be aware that life's idea is to live it happily ... without angry, without living "under a rock". The film concept is more interesting ... connects the story with real life events ... keeps us aware of everything .. from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about how to live your life!
