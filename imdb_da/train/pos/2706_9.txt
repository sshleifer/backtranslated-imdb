I watched this movie at the international film festival in Brussels. I also met the film director. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story of 10 years! I'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr Wood did), it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And it's cool. The big joke of I woke up early The day I died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> It makes the movie very, very good. The scripture is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely outstanding. You see, it's either high art ... or low waste. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
