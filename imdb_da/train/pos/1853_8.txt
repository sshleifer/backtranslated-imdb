Once again, it is a movie that plays with your feelings and you come out all soft as opposed to a rock movie. But I'm a sucker for them, so I gave it a good score ... the actor was very good and there was a lot of feeling. Violence is kept to a minimum that makes a change. I would have given it a 9 if it wasn't for the salute at the end! All in all, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
