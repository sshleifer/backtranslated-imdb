Writer / Director John Hughes covered all the bases (as usual) with this bittersweet "Sunday Afternoon" family movie. "Curly Sue" is a sweet, orphaned orphan, nurtured from childhood by "Bill". The couple lives off their wits as they travel the big US by A. Fate matches them with a "very beautiful" yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, which they can relate to the heroine, played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who continued to be "you go girl!" by Pepsi advertising). The sign should be about 6 or 7 as she is encouraged to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day 9 years or more. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there are lots of flaps and little fists that pave big fat. Again, this "formal" film production is aimed at a young audience. Entertaining and cordial. Don't look for any surprises, but be prepared to throw a tear or two.
