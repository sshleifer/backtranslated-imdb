The three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts they have made. I love all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also star many other amazing actors and actresses, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, the three stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and are the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Beware! All shown in this short are beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre give good performances here! There are so many fun parts here. This is a very hilarious card. There is another similar Three Stooges card like this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
