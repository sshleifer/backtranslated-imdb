Best show since Seinfeld. She's really really fun. Her total self-centeredness, the hulking gay stoning neighbors, the departure of song or cartoon, make this the freshest show on television. One of the few shows I draw attention to. The scene with the clever old black lady in the pharmacy ("Oh wait now that you are close, you look old" turns face with finger and goes away lol), cough syrup overdose, sleeps with God, it is so funny or so stupid it's just fun. They show weak points are her sister and cop-only because they are too darn normal !! I really can't wait for the next show, something I haven't felt for a show for a long time.
