You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller or an intelligent movie. The story takes you through the life of a person who has lost his life and seeks to regain it. <Br /> <br /> I have to say I was totally surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. It's usually not the genre I care about, but the characters quickly became people to me, and I wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Like many French films over English, we are able to learn much more about the character and impact of their environment on their person. This movie is character driven and will not disappoint!
