It has taken me a while to see this version, as unfortunately I do not seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always borderline with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not British, must of course emphasize, and it is good for me that it does not work naturally. It seems to be happening. Sorry, but don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I couldn't heat any of the characters, but this version is more heart-warming and more the type of person I imagined that Emma should be. It is definitely the version I want to come back to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not looking better, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed her in the movie version, but she is better portrayed in this version. Come to think of it (besides Mr Knightley) all the characters are better played and much less over the top. Unfortunately, both came out at the same time, and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Shame ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a Jane Austen fan, don't forget to see this.
