First I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing the" Cinderella "movie on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated movies on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Edition)! What to do next? You need to go to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) Anyways, Disney magically remains in his 1950's animated classic movie" Cinderella ", the movie that puts adventure movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepisters, her date, the glass bag, the pumpkin who turns into a cart just to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And of course trying to go home at midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a big old adventure that kids like, now in film form (as well as on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
