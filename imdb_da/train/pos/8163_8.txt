Corbin Bernsen gives a terrific and rapid performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is perfected. When he discovers his lovely blonde babe's trophy wife has cheated on him, and the IRS starts hounding him on tax issues, Feinstone jumps under pressure and goes violently around the bend. Director Brian Yuzna, working with an appropriate dark, twig and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, reveals the insane neurosis and psychosis that bubbles under the creaking, clean, well-groomed surface of respectably wealthy rich America with deliciously malicious joy. In addition, Yuzna spice up the pigs riddles with a viciously twisted sense of pitch with black gallows. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Feinstone; He professionally empowers a truly unpleasant underlying creepiness that is right under Feinstone's deceptively quiet and secured veneer. The support aids are also outstanding: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's bitchy, incredible wife Brooke, Earl Boen as smugy, meddlesome IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as feudal assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as perky assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as jolly head of custodian Candy, Virginya Keehne who cute, gawky teen Sarah, Ken Foree as thorough, nonsense Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs' equally scant partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as female stud muffin pool cleaner Matt and Mark Ruffalo as on make sleazeball Steve Landers. The first-class make-up f / x is just as gory, rough and disturbing as they should be. The polished film by Levie Isaaks boasts lots of beautiful, crazy, angled camera angles and a few tasty zoom-in close-ups. Alan Howarth's exciting shaking score also hits the meat crossing. An enjoyable spoiled treat.
