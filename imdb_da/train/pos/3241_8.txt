Action. Comedy. Excitement. This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> The reason is that 4 would be professional thieves invited to join a heist in a small Montana town. All types of crime archetype characters are here. Frank, the master head. Carlos, the weapons expert. Max, explosive expert. Nick, the safe cracker and Ray, the carman. Unfortunately for Frank, he is arrested by 2 bumbling detectives (exhibited very well by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who have chased him from New Jersey after sending the letters to the other 4. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the start none of them can suffer or trust each other. Added to the mix is ​​the fact that Frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together. <br /> <br /> Now, Frank is being taken back to New Jersey by the two detectives, but soon he comes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who have all sorts of problems of their own. <br /> <br /> Really a great movie full of laughs and great plays. Just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
