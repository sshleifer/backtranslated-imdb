I've read some horrible things about this movie so I was prepared for the worst. "Confusing. Muddled. Horribly structured." Although some of these accusations may make a profit, this movie was not as near as horrifying as your average DVD programmer. In fact, it actually had hopes. It tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And by god there are some interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Wife. Barbeau is a miracle to see. She wears the film completely on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually collapses under the weight of its own ambition. There are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. And those plot loopholes created by time travel are never really corrected: for example, if Hope knows her mother is evil and that she will eventually kill her brother, why is she just turning Ma in the very first order of the movie? It seems that it would have gone hell out of entering the future to do so. <br /> <br /> I still give UNHOLY points to try. A small ambition is not a bad thing.
