Enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller movie about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rental and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and hurries to try to achieve this position. Julia gets the job and is hired by a wife Hughes (Dame May Witty) who requires her to live with her employer in her home and wants her to have no interference with men's friends, and Julia tells them she doesn't have any family and are free to devote all the time to this work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs Hughes and has some very strange desires to play around with knives. This was a low budget movie and most of the scenes were close to avoiding the expense of a background and cost to the landscape. This weird family lives in a large manor house off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are secret doors and lots of excitement.
