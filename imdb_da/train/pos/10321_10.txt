Most people miss Hollywood's concept. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds for a child's mind within the framework of law, then I approve of the lessons learned from Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> In all times of conflict or war public and governments look for heroes to decorate. The film industry brings heroes to the screen where people can identify with - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the best of James Bond, Superman or any of the others. Everyone else who follows Doc Savage is only part of the character, not "Bronze Man".
