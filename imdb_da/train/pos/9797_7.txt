Batman: Batwoman's mystery is the latest animated Batman straight two video / DVD movie to be released. (Minor Spoiler's Ahead) The plot is about a new crimefighter, Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, to stop a major arms shipment. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as 'Phantasmask', 'Sub-Zero' or 'Joker's Return.' The main reason is that it does not renounce the emotional appeal of the other films. At the end of this movie, we do not feel so sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially 'Sub-Zero'. There is no real tragedy that made the other animated films special to us. Even Batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm was). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly stiff and boring that the viewer does not really care what happened to her who made her put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and there is the main reason we get Not this particular emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me, I found the movie enjoyable. It has its moments, eg. When the audience finds out who Batwoman really is, and sees an old villain back who was last seen in the original 'Batman: The Animated Series'. The action is also very entertaining with some very exciting moments. If the Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'Return of the Joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's in the 4th out of 4. <br /> <br /> The animation is the same as The New Batman Adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990s. The result is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because it's fun, despite its flaws. But remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
