I was ready to throw this episode in mind that this 'Master' really has no horror film under his belt .. but this is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The action was good !! I don't know how he beat it, but we have some real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming from a mile away, it was at least entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for a full 56 minutes, something missing up to this point in the series. <br /> <br /> I especially liked a little at the end, not a twist. Say, but just a fun little where he stays, who ever chopped her hubby. Really good effort. As I have said in other reviews - it is not true gentlemen who make many of these episodes. But they may even end up being masters of the future.
