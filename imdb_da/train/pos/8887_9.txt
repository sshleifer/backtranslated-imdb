When I watched the movie, I was really shocked to see what the 60s were about. I know I may be wrong about some things, but it seems that the 60s have really had an impact on people's time. Some people said they would like to go back to the 60s. From what I saw, I would say yes to the excitement and no to the result. But that's my opinion.
