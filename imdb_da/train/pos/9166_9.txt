If a more masterful fit than this once existed, you don't have to look for it; you will find more and more in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontës's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a movie that would encourage me to read the novel it was based on, but I admit it here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the tremendous curiosity and feelings that this masterpiece has touched on within me. I don't have to reveal anything in the way to see here. Let me just say this: If you are unsure whether to see or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre, I ask you not to doubt! Every atom of power and magic that has bred Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature has been successfully taken in this movie. What Brontë didn't take for himself, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate into the limelight with magnificent intensity. The film's success is undoubtedly due to not a small part of their plays. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Jane or hate her, but appreciate wealth, vitality, truth in history; love the characters love the actors; everything that you would love, what is great in the cinema.
