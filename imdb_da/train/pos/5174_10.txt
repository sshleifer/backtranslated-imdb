I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it! Every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by acting, the script, the direction, and the general feeling of this movie. It has been a long time since I saw a movie that actually made me choke with laughter, reflecting on grief and feeling every intentional feeling that comes through in this excellent work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: Do you listen ???
