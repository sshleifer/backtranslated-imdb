While this movie does not come down to the big cinema annals, it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally published in video, where it should have debuted in the first place. <br /> <br /> The movie is about an eclectic group of friends gathering for dinners called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate to get an advance to the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover. Fox gives an undervalued and touching performance, and Nunn is reliably talented as always. Micheal des Barres is a hoot as an over-lawyer. The ensemble casters - made up of familiar faces - work well together to bring this crooked group of characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
