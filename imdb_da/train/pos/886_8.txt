This was one of the DVDs I recently purchased in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to brush our French before our planned vacation in beautiful Provence this year. So far, we have significantly improved our French improved our appreciation of the French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a fresh breath to the outdated, predictable, imaginative, crash bang wallop drive is churned out of Hollywood. What a great example to follow for screenwriters, actors, instructors and filmographers. It was also so stimulating to see two identifiable characters in the lead role without having to be blank magazine figures. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this movie was the slow character and plot build that kept you guessing how it all would end. Is there any really good in this selfish chew who constantly treats his seemingly naive blessing with the kind of contempt that an ex-con would show? Will our sexually frustrated bad, half-deadly heroine prove himself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is fascinated by these issues, and the actors are slowly and convincingly resolving the answers as they face events that challenge and shape their feelings towards each other. Once you've seen this movie, you may like it to see it again. I still have to educate the director's psychological motive for the subplot in the role of parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth seeing another look. The ground asks for a little imagination when our hero gets the chance to help our abused and overworked heroine in the office. You also need to be broad-minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. But if you go together for the exciting trip with this example of French cinema at best, you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
