I was happy to see that she had black hair! I have been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted with the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I was glad the writers updated the period to include a computer, it didn't ruin it at all. In fact, I watched movies twice a day, a sure sign that it was up to standard. This is what I do with books that I like. <br /> <br /> I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and cartoon. I would also disagree with a comment from a previous reviewer about evil being ugly. Did he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie and look forward to successors with expectation.
