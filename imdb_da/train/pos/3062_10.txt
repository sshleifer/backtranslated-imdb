I watched this movie some months ago on cable and it was great. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was just amazing. He cares for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is undoubtedly the best achievement I've seen of an actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise over her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is simply scary as Macy's father, and John Ritter is fine as a shrink in the middle of everything that happens. <br /> <br /> I want this to be in the theater because I feel it is a movie to be seen by a wider audience. It's a shame because it's a hell that makes it better for most of the new movies to enter the theater now. <br /> <br />
