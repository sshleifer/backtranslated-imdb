In the early 1970s, many of us who had embraced hippy / acid / alternative culture had realized that ordinary society would not change the way we thought it would. For me, this movie defined the excitement of "now what?" that many of the people I knew felt at that time. Are we looking for the municipality and creating our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change? From the cumbersome gestures to the police, the radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music, to the love-production and the explosive images in the desert - so much is in there. It captures well an important moment in time.
