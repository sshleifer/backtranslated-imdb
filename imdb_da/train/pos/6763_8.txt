Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who might do such things) sit and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> But some of the best movies in the genre "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In a Lonely Place", "Night and the City" control a level of slender sophistication that raises them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of preventative shadows, fedoras and femme-fatales. <br /> <br /> "Where the pavement ends", a pretty hard to find movie - the only copy in perhaps the best possible video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black shadow of opening credits passes, a curtain draws on the villainous lonely detective Marc Dixon's crumbling world, and as it is currently passing, it is still closer and threatening choking. Of course, he is the well-known "politician with a dark past," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a gloomy stirring and uneasy intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he thinks. And yes, he has for a long time turned around suspects, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and commanding excursion) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates these bullies too much to stop now. And boy didn't they, it came? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dusters, mugs, boys nickel rats" he spits when the boss's hard nut demotes him and rolls out all the complaints the agency has received about Dixon's right hook. The advice is for him to cool for his own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> What world of trouble he finds when he trusts his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed on from a generation before. <br /> <br /> Immediately he is in depth with the police, syndicate, his own partner. Dixon's dubious involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job, causing him to wonder if he is simply the base he has vowed to bring in. As Bogart in "Lonely Place" can he "escape what he is?" When he has no other place to turn around, he discovers that he has almost condemned his unexpected relationship to a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) that seems to be able to make her bitter undergraduate existence something worth coming home to. <br /> <br /> The pacing of this amazing movie is tight and gripping. The group of writers who contributed to the production polished the script into a high-gloss - the dialogue is snappy without going into dated parody feeds, passionately without becoming melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And all this top-notch direction and play isn't too slender or buffet to loosen the emotional team of the movie. Gene Tierneys English soft focus beauty is used to great effect. She turns out to be an actress with great reach, and her gentle, kind nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in "Let her go to heaven". The scenes between Tierney and Andrew's Dixon grow more intensely and touch the closer he looks to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> At the end of his rope, split, crushed and exhausted Dixon summarizes his party: "Innocent people can also get into horrible jams," he says. "A false move and you are in the head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this movie so convincing is the feeling that things could go awry for almost everyone - especially for anyone trying so hard to do the right thing - with a little shift in the wind , a wrong decision or blow, or, most frightening, because of factors that you do not control. Noir has always reflected the darkest fear brought to the surface. "Where the pavement's endings" do it in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (A nit-pick of a page: This otherwise sterile film has a sharp bad double of a blonde model that doesn't look in place at the Mystery Science Theater. How very strange.) <br / > <br /> But Noir fans - heck, some movie fans - who haven't seen this one are in for a great treat.
