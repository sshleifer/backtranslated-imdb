Scott Henderson, the engineer who employs Carol Richman as his assistant, makes a point of calling her "Kansas" when he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, who is actually played by Ella Raines, should be a treasure in the woods as far as Manhattan in the 40s. Only one woman, out of town, would follow the shady bartender to a lonely elevated subway. Yet only a naive girl could make such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak does this very well. He shows a flair to infect the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. Where else can we justify the way drummer in musical orchestra, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such a blame for a lady on a date? The drummer played with the high voltage of Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his wishes for any of the ladies sitting in the front row of the hit music where he plays. It was a really explicit invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of the story, Fay Helm; Subsequently, the Cliff drummer realizes very openly to Ella Raines, who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery lady her boss had originally taken. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will link any viewer from the beginning. There are things not explained in it, but it has one interest throughout. The killer is not revealed to the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with his expressive eyes was an under-estimated actress. She keeps her against many more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York actor working in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is effective as the accused man's best friend. On the other hand, Alan Curtis comes across as a man who, when framed, accepts his destiny and is only rescued by the solid woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film as a detective who has doubts that the police had caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not disappoint.
