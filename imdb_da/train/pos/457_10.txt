This program is very fun and the title song is so catchy I can't get it out of my head. I find when I get older I'm drawn to the wrinkles that get things done and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we would never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and some lawful work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in a way and Barney Miller in another way they work and interact with each other. They screw up a lot, but they get the job done, and that is what counts.
