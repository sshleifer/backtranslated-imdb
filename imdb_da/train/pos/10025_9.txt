This has to be a unique phrase of two genres ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with live mummy film genre. This unique blend gives a unique and compelling story. The castes are excellent, including TOM BOSLEY, which, as far as I know, has never been in a horror movie ever before. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My only complaint, I just wished we saw more of the gigantic mummy, but others I think they did a good job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The action was wonderful. This should be the best movie that comes out of the sci-fi channel. You've heard me, the best movie coming out of the sci-fi channel. I give the fallen 9 out of 10.
