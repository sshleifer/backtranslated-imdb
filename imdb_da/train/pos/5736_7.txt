Dumland focuses on the life of a (American?) Family ... Father; a violent and obscene person who loves to cheat and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities. mother; There seems to be a paranoid psychotic, never saying very much. The son; an unclear annoying repeated little guy. The animation is simple and raw, but fits the stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch.com website but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a short synopsis follows: <br /> <br /> 1- The Neighbor: We meet the neighbor's neighbor and find out three things about him ... he has a really nice shed, he has only one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- Treadmill: We find that the wife has an affinity for exercise, but the man doesn't really think it's a good idea. In the end, the training exercise is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3- Doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live lead ... the medical examination is quite thorough (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is "you are completely normal" (but we knew it ). <br /> <br /> 4- A friend visit: After a confusion with the new clothes wheel, a friend comes to visit (believe it or not, he has one! but after we meet him we can understand why), no surprises, when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5 get hold: we meet another neighbor, he has a stick fixed in his mouth (although we never find out how it got there). Unfortunately, the removal of the stick from its neighbor's mouth is even harder (and more violent) than expected ... but he is victorious in the end ... Jesus some people may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth bleed: This was my favorite episode ... and was also the most mind-numbingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that say about me?). Not sure why the son's teeth began to bleed, but trust me when I say it was minimal for the plot of history. Which is an oxymoron when the story had no plot. But had a fun ending (involving a fly)! <br /> <br /> 7 Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we get a clear sense that the Dumbland gene pool is very low. Uncle Bob is a malignant guy (I don't have to elaborate so I won't spoil it for you). Uncle Bob's wife surely wears her pants in her family ... and his father finally ends up on the wrong side of his nose fist (and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the backyard). <br /> <8- Ants: After the home is infiltrated with ants and a misunderstood attempt to bug spray, it goes wrong ... he ends up spraying his face with the bug spray and starting to hallucinate. The ants put on a fabulous song and dance show ... he walks in the amok, tries to kill them, wins up in a full body of plastic ... and let's just say that the ants get their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories are, there is something that kept me convinced to see them. They give another insight into one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts ?? I actually laughed a lot at many points within the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly fun !!
