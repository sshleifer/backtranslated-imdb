Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story of small crimes every day people commit to in a crazy scenario leading to the absolute disaster. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' grin. Each viewer seemed to recognize the bad side of himself in one of the characters or at least one side of their self they wanted. Actors of all ages, who played larger and smaller parts, were given an equal place in the heart of the Greek public. My personal favorites (except for the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis, and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors of some episodes from time to time. Anyone who understands Greek all over the world should find a way to look at this series, even though it has been on TV for more than 5 years. In Greece, they continue to repeat the series (ANT1) in every chance there is like daylight saving time or early afternoon zones. We never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew!
