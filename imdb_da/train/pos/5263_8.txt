Netflix should mention this short feature on info for silk stockings. Superior in every way to the over-produced fluff. This had much better Cole Porter songs and much more energy. Silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred became too old for this kind of thing, even though the dancers and Cyd are lovely. I want to look for Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre ill during the manufacture of silk stockings - he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with smaller lines? Very happy that I ran across Paree - Paree by accident. Made the whole experience much more fun. Bob Hope, as a simple "song and dancer" is pure joy.
