2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the biggest dance scenes for rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The play was the top of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in top form since the side since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were performed with dynamite precision and snappy white last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next appearance of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus !! It's .... Gone" It was the right turning point in the movie. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis tapes. Through thick (held up at the knife point) and thin (Nathan gives Tony tips on women), the new dynamic duo has arrived and is out to conquer Hollywood.
