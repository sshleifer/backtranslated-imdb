Playing a Queen is a difficult thing. On the one hand, the actor must be majestic and imperative, and on the other hand, she must show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the maturity and decision to overcome the odds, as almost every movie about queens has the basic plot line. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is pretty brilliant as Victoria, but it's not as full a performance as I want, no fault for her. I can't help but feel this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation to a darker and more dramatic movie about another young Queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, Blunt does not run out of the Queen's feelings, at least not to the full extent, as she is the young Victoria. To see old Victoria, check out Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of film director. He did last C.R.A.Z.Y. which was excellent and drove him to praise. It was a completely different movie, but I remember it looks pretty, and that is probably the greatest similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this was by Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story of this movie was much less interesting. I quickly became crazy about all the state policies. Perhaps it was less engaging because there was no potential abolition of the monarchy. I am just saying.
