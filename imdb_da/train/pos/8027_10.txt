When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Throughout history, spectators can expect Richard to kill Thomas, or he will do it first. But the main point was not conflict, however. FRIENDSHIP! Mature and mature prayed to themselves to save the younger, who has the whole life to life.It is great. Every time I see it, I enjoy it! Of course it is quite violent like any action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Many thanks to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Great film! I advise everyone to see it. I am sure people will not regret and really want to feel good.
