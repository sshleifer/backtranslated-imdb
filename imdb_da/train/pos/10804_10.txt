Though in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the canal that showed this in the beginning. First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump in his throat, so the sight of a Tiger Moth (like my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a little moisture around the eyes and then Crowe's name hung me completely. I was attracted to this movie, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and, yes, what debt we owe), how various issues were addressed and treated, the flying sequences (my father also flew Avro Ansons), that story - and as a another contributor pointed out Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not spoil the movie for anyone, but separate from my wife with 4,000 odd miles as a former chief officer who was deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I admit to crying heartily a few times. Buy it, rent it, download it, ask, borrow or steal it - but see it. <br /> <br /> PS Did I spoon a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? Looked like a double-engine airplane with a double-.303 Brownings in a dorsal drizzle.
