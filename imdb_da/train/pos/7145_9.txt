This movie had a large ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors who will be in film for a long time if there is any justice. Management and editing were great. I have to look up the book that this was adapted, it must have been good. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast to see! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but were funny when they were on the screen. The kids at the camp couldn't have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
