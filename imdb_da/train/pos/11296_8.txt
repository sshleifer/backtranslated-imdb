I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just outside high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the workers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping an aircraft tire's tire) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. For one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south towards San Diego. Just short we stopped at an army base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. When we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton, the Great Marine Base. On the beach, we began to build what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun reinforcements, sand-covered trenches and living quarters. All of this was at very high pay, sometimes 'golden time', which was triple our fixed hourly rate. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch etc. - which was great because it was time of war and very hard to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> When the job was finished, I waited eagerly for movies to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly for two hours in the movie before my craft finally came on the screen. Then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smiths. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the movie and haven't seen it since. I later learned that this film was attributed to the government, and Fox was paid on a plus plus basis, which may account for our extravagant wages and lifestyle down there. Bob Weverka
