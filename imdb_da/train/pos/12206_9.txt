Of all the 1940s and 1950s movie moments, this must be one of the strangest and most fun things to see. I say so because of the four main players: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are known to everyone, but the last two made this movie so entertaining for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby", is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in movies. His voice and some of the things he said should be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short blonde hair, but still Hayworth, which means a lot to pour if you're a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as ever. One tip: If you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitle. His character in this movie is an Irish and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also controlled the movie, which means you have great camera angles and amazing face pictures. You also have a unique end, visually, with a shooter in a mirror housing. Good cases! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere in the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
