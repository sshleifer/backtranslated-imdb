I just want to say I've seen this movie twice now and I love it! The action is great, and although it's a similar plot to "raise your voice," I think the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing. It has some good lessons in it and shows us that we can do something if we try. An incredible movie. I am sure this is one I will see for a long time to come. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is quite a realistic plot, perhaps not about the infatuation, but the part about being different and struggling, but getting out at its best is very true to real life. The only minor criticism is therefore that the main girl in these films is always beautiful? Do you really think Holly would have met the perfect guy of his dreams if she was ugly or average? I doubt it..
