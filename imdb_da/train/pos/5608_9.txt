Sure, he quickly became uneven after this movie, but from "Knife in the Water" up to "The Tenant" Roman Polanski could always be expected to deliver something fascinating and unique. Despite many ongoing themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really alike. The story of this is similar to its own "Repulsion" from ten years earlier, but the tone is quite different. The "tenant" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (I am a little hesitant to call it humor, though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialogue were occasionally fun) with some really exciting paranoia. Polanski was always a master at creating turmoil, and moments in this movie are almost unbearably scary. The movie's overall entertainment is also a plus. Besides Polanski's exquisite as usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer good contributions. The Polanski actor is often exceeded by the Polanski director, but his performance here really captures his characters awkwardly and the feeling of being an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this movie more than just strange to be strange. The rest of the casting also gives strong performances, especially Isabelle Adjani's sympathetic tour, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters' appropriately annoying. The "tenant" is often undervalued because of how clear people are to reap praise on both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but it is just as brilliant as one of those classics. (9/10)
