Viggo Mortensen stars as a new prisoner of a haunted prison, where the guard (The Game of Lane Smith) has a secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners are slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the liver who knows the secret and is afraid of his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action movies with Stallone or Van Damme or high caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. But I do not expect a ghost story more in line with Exorcist III. However, prison is an atmospheric effort, and it is certainly the best film of Renny Harl's career. The film is scary and has some good actors from a cast of (at that time) unknown. Lane Smith comes out of the best because his cherishes are not the usual clich√© of vicious personified, but rather nervous and boring, giving some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4- (Good)
