"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba, and some other guys are transported back to the Civil War feudal Japan without any particular reason, and much carnage ensues. It's a little over the top essay of swords vs. machine gun, which ultimately gives some interesting results. The plot runs essentially along the rails you can expect from the title; first fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc, etc.), "we are no better here" discussions and ultimately a big blow. The latter is evidence that the film does not take seriously at all, while the carnage occupies most of the second half as the samurai army fights Chibas peloton; a face of one would fully expect of the title, but still manages to be overwhelmed with its ingenuity and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique fighting sequences of its time and does not draw in spite of the extended length. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives a gruff performance like Iba, initially a good leader, but one who finally doubts his own morality, as the situation slowly has an impact on him. This is definitely one of his better vehicles from his amazing CV. By the final act, the two worlds have had such an influence on each other, one has to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism among the authors, as they seem to ask "were we not better then then?" . But it may be a bit read in that it can generally be described as a very entertaining two-hour (almost) non-stop action.
