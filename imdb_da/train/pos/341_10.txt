I really enjoyed this thriller! I would see it again as soon as it was over. The casting was excellent, the plot was exciting and entertaining, and it was just an exceedingly enjoyable movie! I would rate this as one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! The girls in it were also cute too, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some OOMPH!
