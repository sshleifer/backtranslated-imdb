Aro Tolbukhin burned alive seven people in a mission in Guatemala in the 70s. He also stated that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women and then put them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary portraying Aro's personality through several interviews with people who got to know him and through some scenes played by real-life actors. "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, it is not at all fun. Such a terrible testimony of how a childhood stream can make a man a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
