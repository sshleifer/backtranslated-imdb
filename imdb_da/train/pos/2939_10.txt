Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen, and it's a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I've seen this movie hundreds of times, and every time I see it, I still have side splitting fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you will have to see it several times to hear all the jokes because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is fun! <br /> <br /> Although there are many fun comediers out there - after seeing this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like first-class citizens. If you've never seen it - get it, see it - and you'll love it !! It will make you holler !!! :-)
