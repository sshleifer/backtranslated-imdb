Like many horror fans, I've been fed the same banal big budget Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years. Here is finally an original horror genre movie that marks all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles, and you want blood much of it at the bucket load - you have it. <br /> <br /> With excellent fighting choreography and a supportive role from the Hammer Horror scream queen Stephanie Beacham, this is truly amazing thing. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget of choosing to use 35mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, Director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must for old school horror fans.
