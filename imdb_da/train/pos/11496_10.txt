Also love this movie. So when it first appeared in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The movie erotic hit the crowd and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, the producer and the director was always emphasized by it. In his genre it was a very ambitious movie, especially when you think it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of that movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or three short films also worked for television before becoming a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For those people who want to watch the movie again, you could find it on their website, which is not that easy to search for but it is possible.
