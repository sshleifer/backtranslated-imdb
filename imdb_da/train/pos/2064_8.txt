ScareCrow was on the funniest killers I've ever seen in the action! Plus he's really bouncy mostly he ran around, which was amazing! Also he had an excellent voice, I mean, it was just perfect for him. The story lines were also excellent. I like how the baby's soul was transferred to ScareCrow, who was cool! Plus he had a reason for everything I kill after what the people did to him ..... I would also be angry! ScareCrow's look was really good! his appearance gives this person a "OMG!" reaction when they see him! It was great, the stars he got were fun! These people were stupid, who would stare for such a long time! They should see and run for their lives ... even though it wouldn't make a difference!
