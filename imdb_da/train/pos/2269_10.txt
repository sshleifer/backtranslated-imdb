I recently read the novel's "mornat", I've owned the DVD for some time now and watch it so often. Few movies I own and have seen have made me think and question as much as Mother Night has, I am amazed by the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but of the translation of its text to the screen. <br /> <br /> do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on DVD and it must be accompanied by the director's comments on the movie. To see how they took a rather simple story, yet complex in their substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think every viewer will be amazed. The omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much, the film may as well be the book and is the best fit I have ever seen. I strongly recommend both the book and the movie together that it makes a misunderstanding just to say, see it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
