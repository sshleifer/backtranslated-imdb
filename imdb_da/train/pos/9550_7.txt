Despite the success of comedy or drama, Turkish directors are failures in horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of the horrible horror Turkish movies. <br /> <br /> But if you see "Gen", you will understand that it is a strike. The movie's atmosphere is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie, but the script is not perfect, and the movie is common. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" adds no difference to horror movies, but it doesn't disappoint thriller fans. In this respect, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
