About two hundred members of a Cleveland, Ohio US film community called Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 to see a pristine Cinemascope print of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 movie, "Zabriskie Point". Cinematek director John Ewing, who does a superlative job of getting the best prints for his series, shared with the audience in advance that this print was specially flown from Italy, for it only showed. <br /> <br /> The audience was kept spellbound as the film unfolded its artistic on the huge panoramic window. Look at this amazing print, shown the way Antonioni intended, made one note that this is really a modern work of art. It was more appropriate that the series be included in the Cleveland Initial of Art at the University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful imaging of images, striking use of colors, sweeping choreographic movements, all is the work of a true artist who uses the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his story unfolded, it became obvious that this work is not about history in itself, but rather an artist's impressionist representation of fleeting images of his subjects. The setting of some of the more turbulent activities in the sixties gives only a dramatic engine to the artist's sweeping collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can pause at any time to creatively embroider an event with grandiose decorations. The audience voluntarily went with the flow of his remarkable imagination when his great images on the massive canvas kept one in close attention. While the audience may only have been tangentially involved in character relationships, it realized the theme here is human aleination, the director's recurring theme. <br /> <br /> It was also realized that no print of lesser or lesser quality than this original in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular reproduction. The audience was therefore more grateful to see "Zabriskie Point" in its original, breathtaking format and broke into the German applause at the end.
