This is a very rare movie and probably the least known from Shirley Temple, as it is not on any of her collections. The reason why it's probably because it doesn't have a good ending, unlike all its other movies. It is also not a musical, although she does belt out a song called 'The World owes me a living'. The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and on VHS, I would say that they have done a fine job, as the color seems to be realistic, unlike I want to say Laurel And Hardy's colored movies that are horrible. The movie is good for its age, and the story is not dated at all, I am surprised that no one has tried to make a remake. The hour's movie is a bit too talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out. in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five. Although do not be discouraged by this because this movie has some really good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga Ry Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. The excitement and slowly building up his actions (while his daughter is singing to an audience in another room) is very well-directed.Gary and Carole's edgy facial expressions when put under control are also very good. In all this is a good movie from the early 30s, accepting it for its age.
