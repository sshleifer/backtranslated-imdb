Having seen the short a number of times on the horror movie marathon, I think it is a humorous parody that slices to the focal point of its reference. Although the themes are crusty and obsolete to today's viewers, it is by no means a time-consuming waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although it is a student movie, gives little cause for an excuse, the evidence is that it appears to be carefully crafted on a budget with little or no dough. <br /> As noted by another reviewer, it's less than ten minutes, there's plenty of time to clean the palate with a bowl of joy, sit back and loaf idly through the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this short film of a movie should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference, and the viewer must relax and roll with it.
