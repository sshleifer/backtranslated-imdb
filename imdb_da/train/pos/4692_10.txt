Although critically maligned, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a movie that should be closely monitored; Some of the fun pieces are finished in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them. Watch out for Michael Keaton's use of the price gun at the pet store ... and also on the documentary years that appear at the beginning of scenes. It's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly, even though you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here - if you've had her better-known movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should give this a look. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely sympathetic in the title role and the supportive cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
