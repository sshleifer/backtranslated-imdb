And a rather unexpected plot line too for the era: there's Plage in New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's trademark topics: water fronts, working men, crowds, refugees, blue collar folk music, violence on a backstreet are all exhibited here. Jack Palance is quite effective as the icy mobster of a great score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast, but certainly delicate as his go-far. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the stalwart, wife wife - I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. He always reminds me a little about Sinatra-in the face and in the intense quiet way - and it is meant as a compliment about something. I had never even heard of this movie, and yes, you must admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, making an unlikely but effective team. The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know it's not exactly done as it would have been in Real Life - a little less at least no? - But I found it worn plotted together nicely. <br /> <br /> Check this out. It is well. *** out ****
