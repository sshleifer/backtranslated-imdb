This movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people seeking temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the viewer to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature and faith of the Bible. And third is Jesus' humanity. The tension of the Christ-betrayal develops and is held through the film. Judah's passion is presented as a darker parallel to Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can feel the fear. Peter's denial and guilt, however, are not as strongly portrayed as Judas' drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether trustworthy or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, for use in study or discussion groups.
