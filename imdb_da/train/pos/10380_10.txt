in 1976 i just moved to us from ceylon. I was 23 and had been married for just over three years and started out as a lesbian. I watched this movie on an old black-and-white TV with horrible reception, alone and uninterruptedly in a wake-up call that seemed to be an echo of the story. I lived in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone else here, i never forgot the feelings the pictures of this story evoked and their remains of fragile magic, and i have appreciated a hope that i would see it again one day. I keep checking in. I also want someone to make a movie by Shirley Verel's 'the other side of Venus'. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy ...
