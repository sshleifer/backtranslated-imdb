I hardly remember this show, a little, but I remembered it was amazing! My oldest brother reminded me of the show recently, and I saw an ad for the D.V.D statement. The network, again turned up to pull this off the air so they could put what else was in place? It should have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not right? I sometimes think network managers believe they are 'god' in the entertainment world. But they fail guessing and flat out, missing good show placement from time to time. Let it be said that they have much more flops than "hits". This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up. In any case, I get this for my collection.
