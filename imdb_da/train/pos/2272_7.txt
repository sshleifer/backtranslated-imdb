Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark tale. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II. After the war he lives anonymously until competing factions want to dig their past. As with much of Vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is amazing - confident and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man forced to perpetuate his past sins. (7 out of 10)
