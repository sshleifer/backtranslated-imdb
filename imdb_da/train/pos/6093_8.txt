I just watched this movie in a sneak preview, and all I can say is ... "What did I just see ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The reason is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the focused, harder, while Black is a dreamer. Black discovers this idea to create a spray that erases poo. The idea becomes very popular and variety becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gets, and the fact that he's still trying to be best friends with Stiller, makes Stiller crazy with envy. As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is commonplace. The direction is strange, with a strange rotating orifice for out of nowhere sped up sequences. Dialouge and acting are very strange; odd in a wandering way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, from the weird "Envy" song that continues to appear on stage, where you think you should hear a classic 80 song, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> So the true question is this ... is odd fun? It only depends on the individual. I blew up the frightening, immeasurable amusement of the movie. After the screening, I heard people calling it terribly unfunny and happy that it was free. Strangely, I understood their point. There are no jokes whatsoever, so if you are not hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Totally hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If you don't, run away from this movie. It will only make you angry.
