I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my girlfriend. We were both quite impressed by the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. It was very well controlled with strong pictures. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a card. It had an original fantasy approach to a very genuine and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon sacrifice to help her situation with her fierce father. There is also a surprise twist at the end that caught me off guard. This leans against the Gothic feeling. I would love to see this as a full movie. - Carrie
