When we began to see this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they respond to frustration, fear, greed, or temptation as they do. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher's abuse of her, verbally, physically, and emotionally, but I just need to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream home, endless supply of expensive stuff, but I'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful man - or maybe not. That's why I see. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you see an episode, you can find something you missed the first five times. We even see episodes out of order (see season 1 on sennat with advertisements, but the whole language, A & E with censored language, resumes the movie network) - when they are on, we are there. We have been completely spoiled now. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprops. "An albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. Once these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I should have a life. I want when the series ends and I have collected all the DVDs and put the collection into my will.
