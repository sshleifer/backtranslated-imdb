As one who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, I find this movie to be inspiring. If anyone with such a serious case of CP as Christie Brown can do so much, then there's no reason I couldn't reach my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give amazing performances. <br /> <br />
