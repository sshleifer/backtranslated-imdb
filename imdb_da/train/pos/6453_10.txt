The arrival of a world famous leader of unexpected events and emotions in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he manages the church choir and how people in it gradually change. This movie is heart-warming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing out the best in people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are excellent, Michael Nyqvist we know before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance for me. She has a most vibrant face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg makes his part as Gabriella's husband almost too good, he is also terrible to see. You only want him to be thrown to play a good guy one day so we can see if he is also championing that character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not leave you untouched. If you haven't already seen it, do it today!
