Most obviously, there is direction and choreography that limits each champion to a 'style' - it is really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the language of the camera uses some impressive techniques (even in today's measurement), changes real-time projection speeds to slow-motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to portray history direction to the past or future. <br /> <br /> At least the obvious, but most powerful and unexpected is the construction. The winner of this competition is determined by who unfolds the story. The master (the author) creates a game where the protagonist does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation we viewers are in.

Much more clever things than what we usually get out of this genre. <br /> <br /> "The Five Venom's Idea is the template for Tarantino's" Deadly Vipers "from the" Kill Bill "volumes.
