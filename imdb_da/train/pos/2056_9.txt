I don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes scarecrow is a kung-fu shooter, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really didn't enjoy watching a movie since Candyman. So the city chooses on one child who calls him scarecrow, even his mother doesn't care about him. Then he is killed and the spirit is infused into scarecrow, which then goes on a killer. His death is relatively easy to assume when the movie starts. The dedications at the end go directly to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication to Dario Argento really hit me so cool, these folks who want to make movies of a newer genre. Over the film, many Arnold rip offs, with a liners you will surely laugh like sticking and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say take a pizza some friends a laugh your A $$ off with this movie. I love it for its originality, most fun.
