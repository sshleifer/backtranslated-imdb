We must remember that the fifties were practically a blank slate when it came to film. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two wheel holders, etc. To movies with a message. We had the Blackboard Jungle, on the waterfront and so on. Some people may think it was an improvement. I dont do that. Who was the mogul who said: To send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than any kind of distant therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a beep. It's about three sisters trying to reject control over their dead father's property. One of them, perhaps the only worthy redemption, is helping the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family in bay. He is originally in it for the money, but eventually falls for her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family's arrangements are sabotaging the romance. The results are predictable. You get a bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing. We will never meet with the parents, but they really have to be screwed together. Cast is virtually unknown. One or two of the players sound vaguely known. The action is so bad, it's hard to believe. It was released under United Artists' umbrella by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot in and around LA most of the night and probably without permits. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to pack it up in the middle of a scene. I can't explain it - not even to myself - but I gave this pile of waste an 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad, it's good", but I don't think I've ever run into the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this certainly fits. You might try this if you love movies that look like they were made in a person's basement.
