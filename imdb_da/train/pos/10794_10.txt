I've always enjoyed watching Chuck Norris in movies. Although the play may not be amazing, fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed watching Judson Mills perform next to him. In my opinion, Norris Brothers proved to be good entertainers, and it was another good production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
