I have decided not to believe which famous film critics say. Although this movie didn't get the best comments, this movie made my day. It made me think. What a fake world this is. What do you do when your most beloved deceives you. It is said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when you get a chance. The same way, some people are such that they are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately thinks of themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother dies accidentally in a gangster's hands. The surviving brother decides to avenge himself. Through this process, we learn about the contemporary in this world. Nothing is right and no one is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actor who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. Her role was small, but she portrayed her role so diligently that she was moved by her achievements. Chawla had really good facial expressions, but her role was very limited and did not get a chance to fully express herself. <br /> <br /> An amazing movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His film always gives a message to the audience. His film is like short stories by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist whose short stories have always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message to the audience. They are entertaining as well as teaching.
