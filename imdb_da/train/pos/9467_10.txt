I was drawn to DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent reviews and thirst for a drama that was well-written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell stars in the movie, you know an audience who will find that in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. WHEN IN REAL LIFE, this promise was delivered. <br /> <br /> The movie is so real to many families around the world who have lost a member and yet gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully finished and written that their scenes were so right for their characters and for their travels. Cast, set and history made DAN IN REAL LIFE one to remember as we head into the holidays in the future.
