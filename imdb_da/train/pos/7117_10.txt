This movie is a great movie. Everything about it, in my opinion, was top notch from the actor to the director. I know that Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not DVD. Why isn't that so? A friend recorded it from TCM for me, but having it on DVD would be great. For special features they could say a marine historian talk about the fight, and if mr. Schmid's wife or son is alive, they could also be interviewed. Still, it's a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it ever gets laid out, hopefully it won't be colored. Coloring would, in my opinion, just ruin the whole effect of the movie. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as 1945, the film would go. Mr. Garfield did an excellent job of portraying Mr Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to over-treat that part of Mr Schmidt's disability, but I feel he just got it right. I sincerely hope they come out with this movie on DVD one day as a tribute to Al Schmid's courage and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
