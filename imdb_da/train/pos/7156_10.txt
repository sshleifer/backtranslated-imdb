Hole is a great movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isn't cheesy. Holes are generally a very nice film picture. I wish Disney would do more pictures like that. Holes are actually a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that are cool. Don't get the wrong idea, I don't mean bad mouth Disney, but most of it is stuff aimed at kids and that's OK. Children also deserve to have their entertainment. But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teenager's audience and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's the type of movie anyone of any age can see and enjoy and doesn't even think it's corny. It's really the kind of movie that even many young hats can enjoy, as there are signs in what they can relate to. Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment, but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this.
