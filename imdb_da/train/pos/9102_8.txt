I watched this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Watching it on a big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of the TV screens most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always enhances the cinematic experience as the film takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story into the picture. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a set of characters that are loosely connected. Their stories cross on some points, and many storytelling reminded me a lot about the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the true hero of the film is of course the city of Madrid, which provides the background for the whole movie. It houses the signs, contains the pavements and paths on which they go, and sets the backdrop for all events, all in beautifully recorded scenes. The film returns over and over to specific themes (shoes, for example), and essentially, Salazar makes its metaphors more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. He combines the city's views with the actors' shots and fits elegantly with the feel of the scene to the background. A set of talented actors helps him portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene where Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time. It may not work on a small screen, but it easily gave me goose bumps on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The film's message is very positive and therefore the movie is easy and fun at times. The music along the movie is usually pop with a few instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day, even though I doubt it seriously). <br /> <br /> All I got out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more, I give this movie a solid 8/10.
