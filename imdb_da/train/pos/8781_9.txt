I consider myself a knowledge of boxing movies, and as such, there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever made. It's Robert Wise / Paul Newman's girl "Somebody Up There Like Me." The movie may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. <br /> <br /> The movie is not just a chronicle of James J. Corbett's rise, it also shows the sport of boxing on a crucial transition time. In the late 1800s, boxing moved away from the brutal days of harsh rules to the more "gentlemanly" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport moves away from the days when it was an illegal play and towards acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at these days. It's romanticized and yes, even a little hokey at times. But always nice so. Errol Flynn is perfect as "Gentleman" Jim, who really is not a "gentleman" at all, but just a quick talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite adorable as the top class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship (and we all know it is of course love that will win the fight in the end). the end of "gentleman jim" the great john l sullivan (whose famous line was not "lick someone in the world" of course ... romance again) leaves his belt to corbett. This really is one of the best scenes in any sports movement ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hi, if you want realism, see "Raging Bull" instead. It's a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
