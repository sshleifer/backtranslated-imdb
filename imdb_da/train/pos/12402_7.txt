**Warning! Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short is part of two showing on the short part of "The Matrix" where Morpheus explains how the matrix came to be. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not surprising; and the short is not as much entertaining as informative. But that's how it is presented as a file in the historical archives. Visuals are better than average, and the generally cold colors help the purpose of the short. A few issues. The violence in the story is a bit free and combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenes) detracts from the short story of the short. Plus it has to be seen with part two to be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant and, despite a few issues, this brief still fulfills its purpose. It would not fit in the original movie in style, content or flow. This is the perfect way to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Good information. Could have been told a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
