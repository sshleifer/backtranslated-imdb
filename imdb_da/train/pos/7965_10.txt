This movie was amazing ... it made me laugh, it makes a bully, and most of all it is talking animals in it !! This movie should be seen by all kinds of people! it's one of my favorite movies and i just love it so much that i just had to comment it !!! it rox! It is so that the heart felt and a wonderful story that makes a big and fervent movie! My favorite character is shade. This is because I think he is the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever like shade, I miss him so much !!! he was my best friend and i knew that when he died he would be in a happier place but i miss him with all my heart !! this movie is the best i love it and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, be careful forever !!!
