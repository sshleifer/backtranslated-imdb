This is a good movie about a person's dreams and drives or pushing to realize them. It's a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why should some people try to find fault with every movie that comes out, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach pushed by his team to take a shot at a professional baseball career. With the excellent support cast, including Brian Cox, as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's performance pass without his support. It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a movie. If I have a complaint with this movie, it is like this: Never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to the handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." It counts two thumbs up and a big "well done".
