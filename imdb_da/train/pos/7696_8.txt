When "Good Times" performed in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcoms. It's centered on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggles to make ends. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was the skirt hunt but well meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who regularly dealt with insults with J.J. Michael was a close-knit child educated on social issues and intended to become a lawyer. In 1976, the producers made a big mistake by shooting John Amos, who literally killed his character. This really changed focus and not for the good I could add. The views began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior that angered black viewers as well as the serial star Esther Rolle who left after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on important African-American issues that existed in society at that time, viewers were shown to be overloaded with skirts on jacket and cool jokes. When Esther Rolle left the quality of the show a little more. Even though it was still tough, it was no longer the great groundbreaking show that it once was. Although Esther Rolle returned to the 1978 season, it became obvious that the show was on its last legs. All loose ends were tied during this season, and the show was quietly faded out of the air. <br /> <br /> First three season: A. Last three seasons: C +.
