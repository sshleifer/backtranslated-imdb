The Internet database shows this as a television program. And yes it was a series on MTV shown on the "Oddities" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I saw this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes running together in a movie with no annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a superhero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah, a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. And then there are the other strange creatures ... I use "or" with Maxx and Julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are right and which are dreams. Maybe they are all right or dream. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one and dreams of the others exist. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had the comic book before the show came out and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. And the show used virtually the same exact work of art (now only moves it) and the same story ... guarantees that the beauty that really exists in the comic will be reproduced faithfully. This was the best show to be seen on "Oddities", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like darker comics or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. It's "Donnie Darko" before there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that it never went to another movie or TV series, but I'm not disappointed. By keeping it simple, they have sealed this film in gold and kept it free of the stains caused by successive failures.
