This movie will usually classify as the worst movie production ever. Ever. But in my opinion, it may be the funniest thing. The horrible direction and manuscript make this movie invaluable. I bought the movie while aiming through the purchase DVDs at my local pound shop. Me and some friends looked at it, though it was pretty drunk. It soon emerged that this was not a normal movie. Instead, an invaluable relic of what is probably James Cahill's last movie is. First, we were confused and screamed that the DVD player should be off, but fortunately we could not be disturbed in our abnormal state. Instead, we saw the film right through. At the end, we soon realized that we had found a dream come true, something that you can reasonably laugh at for hours while you laugh at all the wrong reasons. We soon showed all our other friends and they also agreed it was not a scary movie. This was a movie you can really wet yourself laughing. This was a movie that everyone can enjoy. This was genius.
