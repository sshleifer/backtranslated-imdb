My Kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director has produced more memorable scenes that affect beauty than it seems possible. The music and the dance are of the highest quality. You may notice in the first dance scene that the director has all sorts of things in the background: Second girl dances, a drunk falls down the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew we would look at Mina dance, and I bet unless you seen this many times you did not notice. All in all, perfection.JQ
