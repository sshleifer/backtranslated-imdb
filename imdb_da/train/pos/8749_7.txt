I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. Personally, I thought the girls were very vigilant before landing in prison; Certainly, they should be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they lacked the bond that best friends should have. For example, in the montage where they look at, the way they held each other in the picture was very awkward. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty much understood that the nature of the Danes didn't, but I can see how it might be confusing. Also, why did the camera stay on Manat with a very ugly expression after he had put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie was amazing. I cried when Claire Danes blamed; she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> I would also see the bitchy Thai inmates get her ass kicked. Talk about missing closure ...
