This is a great movie - especially when compared to the insanity of today's politically-minded filmmakers. A movie that can so easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cannot recover, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's soft energy and charm. I don't know what those who feel the movie "boring" looked at - so much packed into it that it never stays the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
