Back when musicals were not shown to choreographers, we had great movies like this. <br /> <br /> Be a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire. I was happy to finally watch this movie. Not quite a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humor, not slapstick the witty tease, collides with Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But on the whole, the American style makes the American figures seem real rather than cardboard caricatures. <br /> <br /> Some ingenious presentations for the dance tracks, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a bus city berkley over the top dance track. They seem much more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the film, instead giving the different character dynamics to appear. It's also nice not to have a clever cracking, mainstream love interest. Instead, we have a gentle mainstream love interest, much more in line with Wodehouse's young aristocratic women.
