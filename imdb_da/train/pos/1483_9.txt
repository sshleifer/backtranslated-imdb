A sophisticated modern template of the loads that work to loosen and ultimately connect the promises of marriage. The main stroke of the story originates from a "homily" spoken by a vicar after the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In the future, the future course of speculation is spelled out, which in some cases breaks from the stress of modern life. The "moral" of this story in a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past, it has been necessary for the relationship to be used by family and friends. This movie was a relative blockbuster of domestic Italian standards. It's a horrible shame that this movie is not available in either DVD or VHS.
