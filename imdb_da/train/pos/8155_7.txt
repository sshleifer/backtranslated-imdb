I'm too old to know (or care for) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And because I'm Canadian, it's likely that I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this movie was a lot of fun when I saw it, a bright little satire. Hip-hop culture is so transparent these days that it's hard not to hear about it over and over again. (If only we could say the same about backpipe music.) I got most jokes (at least I think I did). Sure, it is derived from Spinal Tap, but there are plenty of goals that could stand a tap treatment. Just not carpenters, they are sacred.
