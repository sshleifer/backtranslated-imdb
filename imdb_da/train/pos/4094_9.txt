For anyone who has only seen Disney Productions beautifully animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast', or even Jean Cocteau's surrealistic fairy tale, will be totally surprised by this 1975 French (but with a director from Poland) version. The plot is about a French family of false aristocracy who married a well to make English family. The biggest catch is that the groom carries an old curse on the family. The movie also contains many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this family's curse. From the opening credit to the end, it is an almost non-stop erotic fun house route with some very explicit and graphic sexual content (hence the movie's X rating in the US in the original round, which is now not classified). The movie's somewhat despised mood at the ruling class would probably remind one of Bunuel's aircraft to similar area. If you have a taste for the really bizarre, and are not offended by "taboo" material, then this movie can just scratch it for you.
