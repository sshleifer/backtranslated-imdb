I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice, and that's something to say about a documentary. The musical score, film and sound are absolutely fantastic, as one might expect from an Imax production. Though it is shot for the great Imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact, this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. <br /> <br /> The subject is also so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar in history as he is the only person to win the CART Championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the road for two cars that are very much important for father and son. The first car was found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster Mario ever drove, and we follow restoration to shining perfection. The other car is Mikael's new racing car, and we follow it from cutting the mold through the maturity. Imax just makes the right magic to make the car design entertaining and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was Michael Amoretti's proprietor at the time this film was made, tells the movie. His anecdotes and witticism, drawn from many years as owner and driver, give much to the production. <br /> <br /> Main features are race scenes. Turn up the sound here! There is something about riding together at over 200 km / h and the musical score that completely draws you on the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The ultimate magic element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god in the racing world Mario Andretti loves a father who proudly watches his son's career. They work so well together that each father and son should see this. You can tell they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.
