Authors Perry and Randy Howze made a very engaging little story in "Chances Are." <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man returning to his former wife home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns. <p> <p> Thirty-four-year-old Robert Downey Jr. makes a great performance, helped by Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper and plays each other with a graceful style. I've watched this movie a number of times on television, and each time found it most enjoyable.
