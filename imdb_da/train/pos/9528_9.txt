Frankly, this film has gone over the head of its critics. <br /> <br /> The opposite of forfeiture (is lost) is salvation (being saved), and this film is one of the very few to handle them two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointments involved in the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes. The premise is that the fathers of the movement, the hit man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime chief John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and will do everything possible to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover his own steal from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael knew it, he kills Sullivan's second son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to whistle witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at all costs, even at the terribly high cost of forfeiture. Rooney, who in a scene cursing the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney ends his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the road to Perdition, and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement cellar and requires him to give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only killers in this room ... ... and there's only one guarantee, none of We want to see Heaven. " As the movie ends, it is a little predictable that a character is saved and a character repeats. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, but he goes out of character to play the hit man Sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a hard edge in his face and manner, his eyes haunted by Connor's iniquities. Jude Law plays Maguire in an appropriate scary way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without influence. <br /> <br /> The kinematics played constant light from the dark and echo the themes of salvation and forfeiture. The camera was a green and gray mansion. Grays belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of the depression era of Illinois. The vegetables belonged to the younger sons and the state's land areas. Thomas Newman's lush, sonorous and haunting music had weak Irish overtones and was played in Copland-like events. The sets were authentic mid-western town factories, churches. The homes shone with shiny woodwork. The film's expertise lies in its generation of a unique feeling based on its deep themes, characteristic plays and encompassing music and movies. The only negative was a small anti-gun message slipping into the manuscript y, the film's only node for political correction. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a10 out of 10; Over time, it will be recognized as a great movie.
