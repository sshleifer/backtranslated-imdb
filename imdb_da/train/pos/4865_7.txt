I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one when I read about Fred Astaire with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the coherent quality of Fred & Ginger movies. The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book where humor comes across better. Some of the actors are quite painful to see (especially the young boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew Gracie Allen could dance, but boy did she in this movie. Have you ever tried to stay on one of these spinning wheels in a funhouse? Imagine tap dancing on a high heels! She is wonderful with Astaire and adds a lot to the overall quality of the picture. <br /> <br /> More nice songs, especially fun, are Nice if you can get it and stiff upper lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and look again at funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
