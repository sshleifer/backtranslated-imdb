I'm not sure I understand where all those enthusiastic anti-grudge people are talking about here, maybe it's just some people like to rave about things. <br /> <br /> The movie was definitely imperfect (inconsistent, some may have had difficulty with time changes, actors who are too willing to go places, I'd rather not go etc.) but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I LOVED the 'breach of the rules' bit. NORMALLY, when you leave the haunted house, they leave the evil ones you alone, giving you time to regroup, make friends and find token mysterious paranormal types. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alarm), when you hide under the covers, they can only get you through the small opening you look through. NORMALLY at the end, the ghosts have somehow become less scary, because you have found out that they are just misunderstood or have been freed or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly any special effects-the supernatural bits were loaded while cards were extremely well done. Probably not the best kind of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate kind of horror (nothing against them they have their place) but good for those who have begun to take the conventions for granted and who have no problems tidsforvridninger.
