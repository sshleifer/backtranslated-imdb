I love this movie, but the music on all alumni collections is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists performed the exam in 1972. But almost all the music played on the dancers, etc. are from the 1950s and very early 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having just attended my 30th high school, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance at former high school people is their parents' music. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music - we all know what a desert time it was musical. But it was not completely deprived, and the film's producers should have taken more care. I found these dance scenes very devastating for my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This was a poor director and / or producer decision.
