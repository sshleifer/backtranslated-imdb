When I just watched this movie again from a 1998 showing VH-1, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I watched this movie on TV, it was around 1981, and I remember losing it from my mother's betamax. It was settled for some reason and the wallpaper in black and white, which gave it a period that I grew to. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the movie that begins with the song "My Bonnie" as the camera tense over a scene in Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene where Paul moves to some girls and says, "Look talent!" So it was with great annoyance, I popped in my 1998 taped version and "remembered" that the movie opens with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie". When you see how slow the camera spans vs. The speed of music, you can see, "She loves you" just doesn't fit. Also in this "later" version when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, GIRLS!". And somehow we have remembered the previous version, the same word did not seem to fit either. Why they felt they had to Americans this movie to American audiences is beyond me. Personally, if I want to watch a movie about a British band, I will have all the British colloquialisms and such that would be part of their speech, fashion, etc. Another annoyance was how "chopped" editing was for television. Just after Stu is beaten, the film cuts into a commercial break-mass of them. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it really destroys the effect of a movie to have it cut apart, as we all know. What some people may find as insignificant in terms of dialogue (and thus okay to edit) may actually interfere with explaining a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> My point is the "best" version of this movie was probably the previous version I taped from 1981, which just so happened to include the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene as my 1998 version did not. I began to persuade that there should have been two different versions for television, and a look at the "alternative versions" link regarding this movie showed me right. The fact that the American version had some shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if you care about such things. Imo, the best thing is to try and get hold of the European version of this movie, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unprocessed version. Unfortunately, I had to abolish my old Betamax European version because I didn't know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found that this movie might be one of the best movies about history behind the "Beatles birth". Being aware that artistic and creative licenses are often used in movies and television when depicting events in history, leaves no disagreements with my enjoyment of the movie. Well, you see the Beatles performing songs at the Cavern that made me wonder: "Did they write it myself when I think so?" But nevertheless I thought it was a great movie and the performances wonderful. <br /> <br /> The real endurance for me was actually the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I almost fell in love with him. His appearance, mannerisms, personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot-on. He probably looked like a young John for me to do a double-take towards the end of the movie when you watch the Beatles perform at Ed Sullivan for the first time. I actually found myself questioning if it was actually Beatle recordings until I saw the other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a dead precise story of the Beatles life and beginnings, you can't get better than "The Beatles' Anthology" as it was "written" by the boys themselves. after a fun snapshot of their pre-Beatlemania days before their arrival in America and leaving your anal critical reviews at the door, you can't go wrong with the "Beatles birth" -E MUST be for any "real" or casual Beatle fan .
