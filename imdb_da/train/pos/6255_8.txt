This movie shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who humiliate other people and are cruel to other peoples. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. In the screening, I participated in people who left in the middle because they could no longer see the film. And rightly so. Because the film is not easy to see. It has a very depressing message, and there is no moment of compassion in the movie. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste. You can't talk about terms of enjoyment from this movie. It grabs you in your throat and never lets go, and in the end you just feel breathless because of its intensity. I can't "recommend" or "not recommend" this movie. You should make your own mind based on what I have said before. Just be aware that this is not a regular movie and it is not for everyone's taste.
