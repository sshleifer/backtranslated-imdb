Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he didn't have too much luck on his latest works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but erroneous experiment. Now Lumet brings his best movie for decades and in my view a true masterpiece: Before the devil knows you are dead. I think this movie is like a rebirth to Lumet. This film has an excellent story that deeply has many layers. I also think the movie's ending is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a great performance as usual, and he is undoubtedly one of the best players in our day. is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated by my point of view. His performance here is amazing. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances, which unfortunately were ignored by pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly tha nks to the performances and partly thanks to the brilliant manuscript. Before Devil Knows You're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction, a fantastic script and outstanding performances. We need more movies like this.
