"Enter Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts movies I had the opportunity to watch. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy who will visit a city friend. Like the Tang Lung of the "Dragon's Way". Wherever Sammo goes, problems start, so he has to rely on his martial arts to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character teaches martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even shakes his thumb nose exactly as Bruce Lee does and also sends out his screaming shout. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like seeing a fat Bruce Lee. There is a big showdown at the end of the movie, made up of foreign fighters. Sammo must hit each opponent one by one. Kind of like "The Game of Death", where each fighter possesses another martial arts discipline apart. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fighting scenes and many laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie I highly recommend to all of you martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
