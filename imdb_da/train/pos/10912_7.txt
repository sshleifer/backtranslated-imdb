"The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" (1936), starring the Thin Man series star William Powell (this film was released the same year as the second Thin Man movie "After The Thin Man" comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of Thin The man-movies, but it still looks great. It is still a wonderfully fun, very entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein. Is Myrna Loy missed? Of course, let's not lie., I would be hard pressed to mention better compensation than Jean Arthur And Arthur and Co-star Chemistry William Powell is genuine and fun, romantic, and engaging. <br /> <br /> The story and manuscript of Anthonyu Vieller and John Wine's manufacturing partner, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man ") is close to being up there with a Thin Man bet, but lacks a bit of the right white and sizzle. <br /> <br /> While not in the stratosphere of The Thin The man-movies (what's more?), "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is one of the most un holding dozens and dozens of mysterious comedy "who-done-its" in the "30s and 40s.
