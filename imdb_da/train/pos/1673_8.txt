A fine Martino excursion, this is an exciting and fun giallo with fine performances from beautiful casts and mainly the two leaders, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the Jigsaw puzzle of a plot is so confused and confusing, you just sit back and enjoy rather than trying to anticipate. Exactly when everything seems to be resolved, we are again taken on a new series of terms, pleasant terms, it must be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with lots of gory kills this successful movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal areas. A super-finale put on the islands in the oaks breaks things up and much fun was enjoyed by everyone.
