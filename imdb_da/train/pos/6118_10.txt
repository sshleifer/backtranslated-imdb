Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... It's fun. Its violent. and very comfortable. Most people say it's B, but it couldn't be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good function. Of course, the only strange thing is The Killer Snowman. I think this movie was actually one of the best films in the late nineties. Most movies these days lack the criteria for a Clive Barker Master Piece. That is, be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends Movie Uncle Sam to fans of Jack Frost.
