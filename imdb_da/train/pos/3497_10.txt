One of the brilliant young men who went out and dared to make a teenage romance movie (can I actually call it? - It would invoke the devil out of his fans) in a micro budget, but filled with such tastes, sensitivities and maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect. Thanks again for demonstrating the powers of the "industry" that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet. Somewhere, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and that too for amateurs), decent lighting - worshipers of true indie cinema should see more of this and stop seeing ... Well ... you know what.
