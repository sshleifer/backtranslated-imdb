Don't be sure what to expect from this movie. I love to see Brosnan in a movie, he is always good, but it was completely different. He's a mess and plays very quietly. In fact, he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni :) So yes, there is not much violence, there are not many actions, but the dialogue is cracking, the play is amazing and very refreshing, and it is quite fun too :) I don't think you get out of the cinema that goes "Wow! I was blown away" but you come out and smile after having a good movie. Can't ask for more than that. Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron will put the ads in the wrong and you'll be reversed, up and down, reversed (with reverse sound) ads !! Brilliant. Nothing like seeing a Jack Daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff American "Twin Peaks" comment :)
