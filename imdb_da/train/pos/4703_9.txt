This movie is completely hilarious. Its cast immediately hits the frame and takes us on a wonderful trip through the spoofing gangster movie. Brother's brother's brother's conflict appears when Johnny's brother becomes a do-good D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's criminal rival, the overly acclaimed Moroni. As Johnny says, "That man must be arrested for slaughtering the English language." <br /> <br /> Check it out on video. It's worth a visit.
