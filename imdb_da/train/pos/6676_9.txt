****** WARNING: CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "Mystery Men?" Simply put, Mystery Men is a group of sub-Heroes who are desperately trying to exercise their youth's fantasy life while they both curse their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works day by day, and at night he leaves his wife and children at home while crossing the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel fighting style. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware for newlyweds by day and throws crockery on crackpot villians at night if his mother doesn't keep him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in an unwanted yard to earn his salary, and then takes his frustration on his friends at night and throws badly devised one-liners on both friend and foe and threatens to get really angry?). Ben Stiller draws such a life in this character, you can't help love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the 'moment glory' they have dreamed of ... becoming true Super Heroes. Of course, this can happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a flying, super-cop with enough corporate logo on his costume to stop an extra ball or two. Greg Kinnear becomes a star performance as a Middle Ages trying to regain his fans' attention in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> Bringing back the extra magic that might win the endorsements, C.A. Release Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top threat game for chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a "psycho-facilitator" to fight Champion City for a reflection of his own habits ... and end up capturing C.A. within a few hours of his release from prison. This only leaves Mystery But to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such crafts as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need some help. The recruitment begins and after a painful recruitment party the team joins The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who originally has the only real talent in the team, with its mysterious bowling ball apparently animated by her dead father's avenged spirit; the invisible boy (kel mitchell) who undertakes to become invisible when absolutely no one looks at him the spleen (Paul Reubens) gave mysteriously powerful flatulence of an angry gypsy; and the very underutilized sphinx (Wes Studi), which turns out to be capable of cutting weapons in half with his mind, spends so much of the rest of the film squirting inan puzzles and acting over and over. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a cross-genre romp. Anyone who wants to get pigeon-punched movies in nice little categories, fights for a lost battle. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets that are reused infinitely (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time it is also a serious superhero flick. Both at once. Although not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflected by D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It gives the cartoon world, who demands a suspension of disbelief, to accept anyway, so throw the inevitable wanna-berry - and we all know if superheroes were real, then these guys would be right. If the big guy with S flies around in New York, you'll see half a dozen news reports of idiots in underwear getting their butter kicked on a regular basis. Sure that Shoveller is fighting very well, and Blue Raja throws a fork with great accuracy - all parts of the superhero world. But does it make them true superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable when trying to point out the patented nature of the superheroes. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out several bits to play. Particularly fantastic is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with his bowling ball / father. Still, it is not a comedy in the form of gossip laughter or ever-memorable jokes. It interferes with a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never goes into any of it. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery But for a good movie, ultimately, is that it is very engaging. The weak / lame good guys are ultimately justified, and in a shining moment they really become superheroes; justice is earned and the film ends with a scene that series of realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to feel the movie, then the film can be a good body. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes out as boring and pointless as Mr. Furious' love interest, despite having a crucial role as his conscience. Tom Waits somehow seems confused by his own lines as the crazy inventor Dr. Rather, though, his opening scenes occupying retirees in the nursing home are worth seeing alone. And the villagers are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point made in the movie). The kinematics are choppy and uneven (as it happens in the average cartoon, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overrides the scene, and special effects are never completely integrated into the rest very well. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is incredible. You should probably be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun reel and a good way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 8/10.
