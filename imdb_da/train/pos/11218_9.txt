This anime is a must-see for fans of the Evangelion. It is a former work by Anno Hideaki, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is completely in place. Those who did not like the Evangelion could also find this release a little more tasty. Gunbuster is quite unique for sci-fi anime because it is actually based on real science. In fact, the show has several small "Science Lesson" intervals that explain the physics of some of the events in the movie. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to the light of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving the earth on a six-month mission that travels close to the speed of light and returns to a land where ten years have passed. The protagonist stays 17 years or 18 years throughout the series, while almost all other characters age significantly. Be warned, this show is heavy on sap at times. It also has a few of the most unprocessed breast pictures I've ever seen. I found it pretty easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might be away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax succeeded as always running out of money in the last few episodes. But they managed to use black and white movies and actors to make a good resolution anyway. The ending is a little silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut, I couldn't help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of Anime around.
