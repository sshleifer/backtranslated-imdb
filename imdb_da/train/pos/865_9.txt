Vincent Cassel plays part of Paul, an ex-con awarded an office job where he meets Carla, a secretary who is "pretty deaf" when she has headphones in much deafness? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other to develop as humans. <br /> <br /> What was especially interesting about this movie's complexity? does not fit into clear stereotypes. Paul seems uneasy in the office environment, is he just not cut out for work? This belief is removed when he gets a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The movie has some amorality which I find refreshing and showed how easy it is to act criminal, even though we think it is harmless or justified. Finally, it's a movie full of great ?? moments that touch both and are humorous. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to comfort a screaming baby. She continues to cuddle it ?? But take her hearing aids off her own comfort.
