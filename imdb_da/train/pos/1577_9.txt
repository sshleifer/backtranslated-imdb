SPOILERS ININ. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much more at ease with what the balance of personal history versus the history of events than she was in her previous film Versprechen, Das (1995). the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually felt it was extremely appealing - especially where the visual narrative was concerned (the title sequence blend and the illumination of a new candle in modern times to commemorate different characters died in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points where many people have been confused by: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this may have been implicit, it was not intended. Von Trotta told me it myself! (And she's a very nice lady, by the way!) <br /> <br /> Second, the timeframe for the events was actually historically accurate (the actual dates are displayed on the close-up of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There are signs that Goebbels was annoyed by having done this and had planned to eventually resume those he had released. Overall, it was most impressed by the fact that it was an original story from a very 'over-movied' era. It seems a shame that it has taken so long (for various reasons) for this movie to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same, Margarethe!
