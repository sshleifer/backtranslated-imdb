Finally! An Iranian movie not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, entertaining black comedy featuring subversive young girls who subtly kick the 'system' in their ass. It's about football and it's fun, it's really fun. The director says: "The places are real, the event is genuine, and it is also the characters and extras. Therefore, I deliberately chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a concept of falsehood." The non-actors will make you rooting for them immediately, unless a. Your heart is made of stone b. You are blind. Excellent script challenges the movie patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. It has won the Jury Grand Prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it's almost perfect. Where can I get it?
