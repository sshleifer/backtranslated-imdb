I watched this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really wished it wasn't an action movie or a comedy. So in my later years I decided to see it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the film kept my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, fine songs (not amazing though, and it actually explains why I couldn't remember it was a musical) and all in all a great need for my time. I was surprised because the last movies of my childhood, which I have reviewed, did not even exceed my minimal requirements for a decent movie, yet this film, which I first saw in second class, made me cry today, as It made me cry then. Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel and therefore produces movie-making movies (that and the money of course). Yes, there are continuity errors. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life because nothing is perfect and this movie gets a 10, not because it's perfect. It will be 10 simply because it made me feel.
