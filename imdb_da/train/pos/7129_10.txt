This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I recently found it on DVD when my partner's grandson got it. He looked at it and was excited to learn that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939, and he wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily, I borrowed it from him and saw it alone and I shouted all the way through. Not only does it capture the emotions, class distinctions, adversities, and the warmth of human relationships these years (as well as the atrocities (spoken and unspoken), but it was accurate! I'm also a bit of an anorak when it comes to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) of the right color (white) and all the obstacles to handling bombings and the work of the heavy rescue brigades, I could not fault anything from my memories and sandbagged Anderson shelter and the WVC canteens brought everything back. Between the relatively unspoiled life of the village and the war-torn London was also sharply presented, I lived in 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! I know Jack Guld's work, of course, and you would not expect more from him than this careful details, but it went far beyond the exact reproduction of facts and concerned deep chords on human reactions and the only half-pronounced value assessments of those years. certa one of the great high spots in John Thaw's acting career and Gold's direction and deserves to be better known. It's a great movie, and I've already ordered a few copies to send to friends.
