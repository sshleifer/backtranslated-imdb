This movie is amazing. As is often heard, it is actually very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, I am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing, negative or dismantled as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: While there are in fact some very heavy scenes in doggie, and some characters are called very bad people, you also see love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidl's film. And that's exactly what distinguishes DOG for other movies that try to show the lives of ordinary people in an intense and realistic way. their hardships, their desires, their dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove that the working class's people are trash! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that almost no one is alive as "pure" and "normal" as we would like other people to believe in. And that every living thing has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man who looks at his old girl dances 'the oriental way' as he calls it. I think anyone who finds this scene ugly lacks a beauty sense and has to ask himself what it is, proto-fascist: The signs of the HORSE or viewers who are off the body by a 70+ year old woman dancing with all her charm to her lover.
