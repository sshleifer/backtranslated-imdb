If you have trouble suspending unbelievers then it is not for you. Consider: A woman who already in the Middle Ages finds a newborn baby in a cabbage plastic and raises it as her own. Think about it; she makes no attempt to find the mother, who may be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment, and apparently no one from the Italian equivalent social service goes to try to put the child in 'care' (no social benefits? now I KNOW It's a fantasy). Before you know, young Toto is ten or so, and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from where he comes to a HAPPY man who loves everyone. In nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him, but organized the local homeless into bona fide Shantytown residents, and in one piece he leads them into a struggle against capitalism in the form of the businessman who buys the country where Shantytown stands when oil is discovered. This will swallow something without the subsequent 'miracles' that begin with Toto's dead mother (the old lady who raised him rather than his biological), appeared to him and left him a dove that doubles as a magic wand allowing him to give modest desires and a finale, where hobos fly away to a better place that is likely to be over rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is so far here with Charm and is easy to surrender to. On balance a small masterpiece.
