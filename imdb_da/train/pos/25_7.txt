I never saw it when I was a kid, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it to my 5 year old daughter. Plus, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken's song and dance made me curious. The special eg is cheesy and song and dance is mediocre. But the story is amazing. My daughter was entranced. I loved seeing Walken in this role and thinking about what the future had for him. Very fun to watch him dance! And if the songs were not big, at least they were not Disney overproduced saccharin sweetness. The Ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I had wondered about the inexplicable story. But while it was true for almost every aspect, the Walk's play made it credible. Fun. I would see it again with my daughter.
