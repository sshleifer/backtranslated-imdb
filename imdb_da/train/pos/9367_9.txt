It's not so often a movie can literally make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later their eyes fill with tears. Many movies try to do this, but few can deliver the emotional impact this movie did. Adam Sandler pulls you practically with his heated and often violent outbursts, but makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not pull him down. I'm not going to destroy anything, but there is especially a scene that should have your eyes water and lip quivering. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel anything while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great achievement, but is shiny by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith provide solid performances, but nothing in the ranks of the two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this movie from being the borderline depressing. There are several laughs, but don't think you will stay there long because it gets serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on with how well this movie hit just about every feeling the human body contains, but I want to cut this card. I feel that there is no need to tell you anything more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Although you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it is 100% worth the time. An in-depth movie that is sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course you are a heartless soul.
