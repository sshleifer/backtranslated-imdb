I reached the end of this, and I almost shouted at "No, no no, no! It can't end here! There are too many unanswered questions! Dishwasher engagement? Monas disappear? Helmer's comeuppance?" Zombie "? Little brother saved by his father? And what about the head ???????" ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the cast members had gone further, and I must say that I know that it would probably not be true for Lars von Trier's vision, but I would like to see past substitutes to see the end he had planned! Granted, it would be difficult to find someone to play Helmer as a character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have yet to see a more self-absorbed, ignorant, self-righteous character on the screen! But I could overlook a change in the actors .... I just need to know how it ends!
