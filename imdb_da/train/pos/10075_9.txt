"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. In its simplest way, it is the joking story of a street performer who ties with a child while trying to pass on his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although the story sometimes makes the old man a job, it is so well designed (written, acted, directed, wonderful production value) that it is easy to move beyond his situation. And if you stick with it, the movie is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos around. This is a wonderful movie for both children and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language movies to watch it!
