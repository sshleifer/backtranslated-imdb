Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he would restore the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, I don't think anything is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's list - is your best. Even Oprah works well in this! <br /> <br /> What got me the most is the story and the drama's realism. Things like this happened and still happen in the world.
