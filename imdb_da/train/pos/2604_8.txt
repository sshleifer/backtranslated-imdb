"Amazing Grace" has an upscale feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of different lives in an apartment building. The language is Hebrew, but the drama can take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics with the same aplomb. It doesn't judge the signs, just presenting them exactly as they strive to educate their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and the observations on the figures are clear and sharp. I really appreciate this floating movie.
