For all political views, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's 'Gandhi, My Father' are a good movie exploring the confused-to-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi's struggle with society, his greater father than father and most importantly demons in his head. You draw parallels with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and fighting every son could have with their father <br /> <br /> The action is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna strictly in that order - add color and pathos to this heartbreaking tale of Harilal, crying to be carved once and also running away at the finger's weakest touch. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan's direction and production canvas are lavish and attractive, but the manuscript could have been tighter. I had seen the game some years ago on a pirated video type DVD (it's called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more poignant. Although the movie's background score and father's son and mom-son moments are just a brilliant treat. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. That is the limit to it. It has the potential so great to have been just a story difference between a father and son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute feelings of emotion nothing will come to you. <br /> <br /> It compares favorably with other Gandhi's. Certainly not an overview movie like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract like Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. The film is able to find its foot; But one leaves wondering "what if ..." Worth to see. 7.5 / 10
