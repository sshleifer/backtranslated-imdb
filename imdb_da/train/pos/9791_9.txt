I will not give anything away by describing this movie's plot other than saying that it is starting to come back to Israel by a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds as a detective story as the blind woman tries to find out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information is accumulated, it leads to a devastating conclusion. The film is nicely paced, and the actor, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israel's film has certainly become old and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the United States
