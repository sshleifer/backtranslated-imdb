Surreal film noir released shortly after the "real" genre-defining classics "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Rings Always Twice." Welles movies should not be evaluated against others. He played by different rules. In fact, he played. This begins when other femme fatal films depart, so the vagally logical (but interesting) whodunit is adorned with a display of Wellesian scenes (typically fast-fire style), dialogue (lots of "hard-boiled" philosophy) and unusual plays (good Hayworth presumably consciously one-dimensional ). Welle's "genre" may have meant "formal", but he seemed to be able to use "mysteries" as the backdrop for his "entertainment".
