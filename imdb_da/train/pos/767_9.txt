Being that I am a true product of hip hop and electronic dance music generation, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies from time to time. Beat Street, although not "authentic" in some respects like Wild Style, is a movie that guarantees to draw the heartbeat from anyone who is proud of the culture of urban trial / DJ-based music and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> Although I will admit that in some cases the dialogue is a cheese, you cannot help but feel the characters, and ultimately "wish you were there" for the beginning of the hip New York City hop culture in the early eighties. The B-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-time, real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as important for a hip hop fan archive as a classic album. See some of the slow-motion breakers' movements if it is possible to really appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of an experienced B-boy / B girl. All praise because of Zulu Nation !!!
