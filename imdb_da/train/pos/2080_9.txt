The quote that I used to summarize takes place halfway through the good ground that the captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes for a mob because he has no time to shoot more of the pillars among them when his device has just been called back to front lines. Of course, the next loot, which is about to find out and shot, is the film's main character, the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose account Luise Rainer, now 99 years old, won his second consecutive best actress Oscar). The next scene finds O-Lan obliged to deliver his bag of looted jewels to his subconscious husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), who sets the classic dichotomy of a man's upward economic mobility, it is directly reversed by his moral decline. For a movie dealing with issues including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, hunger, home invasion, eat family pets, mental retardation, infantry, exploited refugees, troubles, civil war, summary mass-guilty executions, bigamy, childhood, infidelity, incest and Insect bugs of biblical proportions, THE GOOD EARTH is a surprising heartwarming movie. <br /> <br /> My farewell thought is in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lan himself (while putting precious soup soup, his son just admitted stealing from an old woman back in the pan after the husband Wang Lung had ugly thrown it to the dirt floor on the other side of their cabin): "Meat is meat".
