An interesting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne, as America's first consul to Japan, arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's armory diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with Shogun after leading a cholera epidemic introduced by a US ship under control. There is a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with Shogun, the debates between the Japanese lovers and a murder during an archery exhibit presents an interesting look at the period's policy. All in all, a rather enjoyable movie and in addition to how often you see that the Duke loses a fight to a guy half of his size.
