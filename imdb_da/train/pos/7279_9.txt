My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 (I have always loved scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes where the RV is under attack in the desert. The monasteries are actually convincing for such a low budget flick. The action is above average for these kinds of movies and the music is scary. This is definitely an undead-rated gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange movies from the late 70's, the beginning of the eighties like "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and " Return of the Aliens, Deadly Spawn ". Absolute classic !!
