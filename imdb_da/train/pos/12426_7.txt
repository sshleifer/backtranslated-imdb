David Duchovney creates a role that he should replicate in Californication - the troubled talent. And it's a role he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you through to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a nice villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a disgraceful doctor who finds his way into a criminal world is well-written. Drug abuse and a desire for the jolly Jolie mixes a hefty cocktail. Unfortunately, towards the end, the story becomes a little weaker, and the relationship between villains and the FBI is confused and hurried as if it were only created to develop the final scene. But aside, a movie worth seeing.
