Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can tell was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have much love for theater, cinema, musicals and the like would be annoyed. This is not a typical television program and it is amazing too much for some. These people seem to need a little more linear and subdued tone to keep them happy. This program explodes with color, gaze on old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices made from the costume to the leitmotif. The story takes many turns, but everyone is very accessible because the conversation is about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things we face each day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show, and it was hurried because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not use this as a typical television program. Think of it as an evening at the theater, so sit back and enjoy it!
