This should be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine stunning cinematography with stunning plays and a gripping plot, and you have a masterpiece. Dogbite dog made me grab the edge of my seat during some scenes, recreate in horror under others and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The movie left a deep impression on me. It is shockingly violent scenes opposite sharp with the crooked and tender "love scenes". The movie is unworthy of it's Cat III (nudity) rating; there are no naked scenes at all, and the "love scenes" do not even involve kissing or "doing". The message this movie presented to me? All people, no matter how violent or cruel they may think, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a great job of playing that part of the murderous Pang. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10. It is a must-watch.
