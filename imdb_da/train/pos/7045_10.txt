This movie gets a thumbs up from me. It's witty jokes, and even the occasional stereotypical and derogatory view of Eastern European people had me in stitches throughout most of the movie. It's plot is clever and 100% original and will guess you throughout the movie. The one person I was most impressed with in this movie was Hilary Duff. It is clear and simple to see that she has taken a step in the belief that went beyond the "chick-flick" genre she's used to. Her accent is excellent and her performance was surprisingly sharp and well done. It's the best performance I've ever seen from Hilary, and I've seen most of her movies. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as 'Britney Spears in Eastern Europe' and this is seen in some of her way and the song, "I'll blow you ... ... ... up". You are also upset by her, as Yonica's performance really tackles you, is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack made me laugh through the whole movie with her sometimes slapstick humor, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle all the way through. I highly recommend this movie.
