One of my favorite films only saw it when I was about 10, who probably tells you a lot about the type of humor. Although dated humor certainly has a charm about it. Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular today with lots of interesting quirky co-characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple is due to get married and are in trouble from 'her' and my favorite, the station manager: "No one knows where it comes from ... no one knows where it goes .." Interesting ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley from Dads Army fame (Private Godfrey the medic) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile.
