The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It's filled with humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the soft, innocent Pecker (played appealing by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other good characters are Pecker's friend Matt ("he is a thief, but he is really a good guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who relies on sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room . <br /> <br /> The film gently makes a point about how everyday life has many riches to offer, and manages to make that point without being too heavy on it. There is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", slipping into a kind of reverse "rather than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, so the audience gets the point at the same time with allowing enough breathing for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie, mostly because it's very fun.
