Good show, very entertaining. Good marshal art company. Good story plot. The entire main staff did a good job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a big hand to Judson Mills. A particularly great tribute to Robert Urich, in his last days. A BIG ! actor who really gets missed.
