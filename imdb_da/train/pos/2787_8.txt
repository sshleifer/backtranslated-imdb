Originally, I rented this movie to my daughter as she is eager for football - and I was not disappointed that way (apart from the plot disturbed by football scenes). As a father, I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the subject of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely accessible to children today (as unpleasant as I feel with the subject). In a way, this feeling was a narrative right into the film's main premise - that in a certain age you have to rely on your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teenage girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of East Indian heritage dreaming of playing professional football. Her older sister waiting in a traditional Hindu marriage gives many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a good way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations of her - again no different in substance than most parenting relationships. In summary, the football scenes are big (lots to learn in slowmo), and while I didn't need the story - something was needed to keep the movie going.
