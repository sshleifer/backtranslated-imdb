This should be one of the most beautiful, moving, thought-provoking films around. It is good family entertainment, and at the same time you get a lot to think about the problems involved. Every time I see "Zaca's ghost on the bike through the pillow at the end, I can't help crying my eyes." John Thaw's performance is so touching, and it's a shame that he's no longer with us. Gone but not forgotten. An excellent movie. Full character.
