I enjoyed this innocence's innocence and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a strong animal in their midst. Gorilla looks just great, and his eyes were especially vivid. It is even a little scary at times and should have kids scared without going over the top. Rene Russo plays his role wonderfully feminine. Usually, these types of Hollywood films that take place in the past are the feeling of the need to create a strawman villain, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them like humans because they aren't. Not many movies wake up in this area and it is worth seeing if you want to consider human-animal equality.
