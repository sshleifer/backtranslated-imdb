When I first saw the Romeo Division in the spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! On future views, however, I was provided with much more than masterful filmmaking. This image has a unique voice that will echo during movie story cancellations. <br /> <br /> The opening of the opening provides an excellent palette, which helmets JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us together on a trip that surrounds the audience in a huge action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we are accustomed to and delve deep into dark themes of fraud, revenge and the importance of the company. This film is every director's dream in the core itself. <br /> <br /> But Sarro was not alone in this epic engagement. The scripture provided by writer Tim Sheridan was equally breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. In particular, the last scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), where Vanessa reveals to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, written in such a dark tone, is one of those most chilling endings I've ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note, it is clear that this production was not small. <br /> <br /> Therefore, much must be praised by producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have creativity and genius to face Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I experienced a production so large with so much attention directed to every detail. A producer's job is one of the toughest in any movie and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the movie's art at its best. When the end of the movie comes, the only thing that is desired is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and most importantly The Romeo Division is actually art.
