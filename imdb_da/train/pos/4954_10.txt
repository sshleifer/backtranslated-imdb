A great, fun, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store while researching a potentially independent film. I was a little dubious about the movie for the first ten minutes, but as soon as he was in the store, I really started to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not contain complex plots, and it is easy to follow but lifts the most mournful mood and makes you smile all the way without the need for petty clich√© romance. It contains several scenes throughout, connecting your pages with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
