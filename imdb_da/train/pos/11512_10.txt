When originally screened in America in 1972, "Night Stalker" became the highest rated made-for-T.V. film in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, it told how a terrible investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When it arrived in British television four years later, it did not have the same impact, but my friends talked about it in school on Monday morning, as I was. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had ever seen. <br /> <br /> I didn't know about the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it came up nearly a decade later. I.T.V., which screened the 'Kolchak' films, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt "Barnaby Jones" with Buddy Ebsen to be more tied, and besides, viewers can confuse Kolchak with 'Kojak'! For years, my only source of information about the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I couldn't even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, the B.B.-2 exhibition exhibited as part of a Friday night series dedicated to the supernatural "Mystery Train" hosted by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found rubbing shoulders such as 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The opening titles were trimmed, removed Kolchak's whistling and the final credits ... yes, there were none. <br /> <br /> The first episode to be screened was 'Werewolf'. I can't say I was too impressed, but stuck in it, and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen it in 1974. My twelve year old would have loved it myself. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder that it fired Chris Carter's imagination. Of course, <br /> <br /> the biggest asset of the show was McGavin. Unlike the latest Kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, quite conservative. He was for the supernatural, what "Columbo" was for crime. The late Simon Oakland was also great as Kolchak's bad army Tony Vincenzo. The scripts flooded with wonderful, dry white. I found myself enjoying the program more for humor than horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt deprived. <br /> <br /> The X-Files came a few years later and filled the gap - but only to an extent. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back. I'm glad the show was never revived. Without Oakland, it would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have the rice books now and have read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King slated the first one (in his book 'Danse Macabre'), as it is almost everything he has written. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but what? The new 'Kolchak' completely missed the original. What you don't see is sometimes more scary than what you do ... Best episode - 'Horror in the Heights' worst episode - 'The Sentry'
