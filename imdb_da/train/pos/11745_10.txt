If you have a chance to watch this movie you can watch it. It's quite shocking in parts and makes you think of so many important issues, but it's not didactic. in my opinion, it is a work of art ... beautifully recorded, fine music of many styles, the typically impressive degree of acting that one would expect from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (billed as 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has the beautifully calming quality that gives it sometimes unpleasant action stability and the comfort of the viewer in the knowledge that someone out there is actually 'normal', but the real star as always is Timothy Spall - certainly one of our biggest players!
