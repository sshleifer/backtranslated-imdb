A lovely Shirely Temple map. Kids actors screamed their lines seemed to be the norm for the day and time. Perhaps "seen and not heard" needs to be made up for. Apart from that, it's fun. In view of the film's era, there are certain aspects of the matter, seen from a social point of view that hit me as both very progressive and liberal. I will not go into them here, I would rather not ruin it for you, but let yourself see it and see if you look at these elements. As early as it was easy to see from this map, the fascination that already developed into the temple. It makes it worth seeing if you are a temple fan. For others, it's a good way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your good-natured glass milk to warm up on the oven.
