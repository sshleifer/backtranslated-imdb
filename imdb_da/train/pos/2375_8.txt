I honestly think it was the best version of the World War I have seen every time. It was fun, but it was also educational, I learned the whole movie, and if I could I would with that movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers killed on the robot and another came just behind it. In the last film war in the world, I think it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but in some way I give this movie 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> And if they where to make another movie like this, I'll definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thanks
