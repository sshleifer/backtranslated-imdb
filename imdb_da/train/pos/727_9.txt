One of the best, if not the best, rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just fun fun. There were really a lot of clever jokes in it. Of course I love Ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and "I hate high school" themes, the film doesn't take itself seriously, which is what is good about it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie in spring 1980 and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me a little nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film doesn't take itself so seriously and isn't pretentious as so much other teenage prize in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. And to talk about it, it's not very dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated. It is rare for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and an amazing time capsule.
