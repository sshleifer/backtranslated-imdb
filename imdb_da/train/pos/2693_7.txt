Although the story is essentially routine and the "surprise" ends is only a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it gives them the kind of roles where good actors can shine and shine. do. The film is impeccably made - for its time. It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion", and if you only want to see a version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend the latter with Hopkins' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points which the original could only indicate. However, the end is still blowing. (** 1/2)
