Solino really moved me with his deep-drawn characters. Although it was a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not just about hatred or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi went through, especially when he was to take his mother back to his hometown in Italy and miss participating in the festival's film award ceremony where his film was filmed. To see this character struggling so hard between his artistic dream and his innate duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end, when making an attempt to reach his father was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother who was more confident and older brother, had so many uncertainties. A really beautiful movie that made me laugh and cry.
