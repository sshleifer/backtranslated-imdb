Really good horror flick to the biggest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa and is trying to find an old meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by its radiation. Everything he touches and the dark side of Rukh makes him become an egotist killer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited remedy for the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of humanity by healing diseases. The two fiends will fight over the radiation possibilities. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
