Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern film noir a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was most interesting, as everyone offers good performances and exciting figures. <br /> <br /> Patric tells in this noir, plays an ex-boxer and mental patient. Wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but he is not. Ward is the slick, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate collaborator of a bad kidnapping plan. Bruce Dern is also in the mix, and Dern never fails to fascinate about any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie can be considered a kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating .... and I don't like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of quirky crime movie. Take a look and see if you agree. This is rather unknown movie that should not have that status because it is simply a good story and well done.
