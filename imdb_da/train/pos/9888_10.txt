Although this lovely work of art uses some of the surrealistic film vocabulary, it is not actually that kind of thing. It is a political and cultural allegorium on Mexico's post-Columbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at Mexico's history will attest. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like water for chocolate", the "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet it at least halfway, so understanding takes a little work. (A good starting point is to see the grandmother's character as Spain: proud, secluded, sad and, above all, weighed down with history.) Heroin's ultimate actions are unclear because history's "outcome" (ie present) is always unclear when we are too close to it for honest evaluation. Refusal to loose loosely ends up being the only real choice available to the director, given the film's ambitions. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful. A big screen experience would be ideal if you could catch it at a local art house or at the university's screening. But if not, VHS is better than never seeing it at all.
