The film reveals the obvious exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering recordings by the Chinese business owner who shares his incomparable and erratic viewpoint, his American counterpart is also so indescribable and misleading, the oppressed workers who get a voice and, of course, the drunk Americans who wear beaded necklaces mistakenly celebrate in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The mica of hope comes when some Americans are actually furious that people who make their beaded necklaces were paid as $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have the feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the pearl factory, but it will probably do so when they get tired of the criminal treatment popular with the factory owner and / or they just get exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day with hard work. I have wondered where these necklaces came from, not realizing how completely awful and difficult it would be to make them. I really really appreciated this movie as it beautifully depicts the influence that American indulgence has on something we consider relatively innocent in our society on people across the world. Honest mention goes to Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
