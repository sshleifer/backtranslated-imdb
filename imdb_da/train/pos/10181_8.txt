I originally bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought hey! Another movie starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in a last-minute item of the movie in a song she shares with SRK and helps introduce her character to the movie in only 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, age, entering into knowledge and enclosing life's hard reality. The item number in which SRK and Aishu are displayed has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, it is a dream sequence that arises while SRK's intoxicated character is unknowingly broken. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who turns up on his favorite hangout spot one day, dressed beautifully and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just smokeless hot! Do not miss it.
