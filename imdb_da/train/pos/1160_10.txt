It is fun. It is not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man it's fun. Cline and fields are good. (Her throw-off line "God, you are so rude" as she climbs into his window - amazing! Kline enters the door after scoring Teri Hatcher - also amazing!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is ... a soap opera trip if there was one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the exit in Chinese dining area had my kids and I rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> Do not solve any problems worldwide or show it apparently underbelly of daytime TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
