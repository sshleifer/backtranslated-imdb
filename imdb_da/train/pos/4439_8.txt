The best-selling horror writer Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance of the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (it looked like Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) goes to a distant castle situated in the countryside for summer holidays. Local legend claims the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, unpleasant ogre (hollowing David Flosi in a strikingly hefty costume) living in the basement. Cheryl has to overcome her deep-seated childhood fear of the animal so she can defeat the foul find. Director / co-author Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and unpleasant nightmare mood. In addition, Bava eschews standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in designing a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale-like fable about how the best way to overcome what scares us is to face that source head. Robust supportive fluctuations by Sabrina Ferilli as friendly schoolteacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria, and Alex Serra as martial artist Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's shiny cabinetry boasts a couple of fluid traces and lots of great atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's gnarly make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's exuberant spooky'n's shuddery score, and the soft, cobweb-covered cellar put everyone in the skin-crawling place. Worth to see.
