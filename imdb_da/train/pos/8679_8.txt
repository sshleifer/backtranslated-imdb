If you are a fan then you will probably enjoy this. If you don't know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema is, it's not the movie to start with. It's very sweet, silly, the girls are warm and it's fun to watch. There is no sex at all to the end of 45 minutes of movie, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not a total bore. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids so she is not as hot in this as she has been in others. But her panties here are pretty cute (you just have to watch the movie so as not to sound really strange). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / exploitation (but lower budget) movies, look at the Factory 2000 website.
