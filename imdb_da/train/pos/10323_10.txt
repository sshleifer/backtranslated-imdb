This is a very entertaining movie. A few of the reviews I have read on this forum are written by people who apparently believe that the film was an action in a serious drama. It was not done that way .... It is an extremely comfortable film, performed in a tongue on cheek. Of course, all the actors have the fun while they entertain us. The fighting sequences are lively, lively and above all not free. The so-called "green death" used by a couple of times is not, as I read in a review, "cruel". A few reviewers were very critical of the martial arts match between Doc and Seas near the end of the movie. Hi, light up ... Again I remind you that this is a funny movie. Each phase of this "battle" was caption, adding the fun aspect. The actors did not attempt to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of these martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing Doc. Another lovely touch is the unique way in which the "evil guy" (Sea) is the ultimate fate. I promise you that if you don't try to take this movie very seriously and just look at the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most comfortable way.
