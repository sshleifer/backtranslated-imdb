Have you ever wanted to know how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially launched? Well, unfortunately, "convention town" is lost, so just have to see "Tarzan and his buddy" to find out. For 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual induendo and even exposed meat. Just look at Jane's naked swim. While Tarzan is often considered a b-adventure movie made for young boys and no one else, this picture shows that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that pushes taboo nature, it is a fantastic and exciting adventure story. I have always enjoyed the jungle movies that Hollywood ran out in the 30s and 40s, but there are few from the genre that I want to call good movies. "Tarzan and his friend" are by far the best movie from this long-standing subgenre. The sequences of the attacks on safari by either monkeys or natives still manage to create excitement today. Also the animals are too cool (especially the monkeys throwing stones). The action will not win any big prizes soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of image. The movie is again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there.
