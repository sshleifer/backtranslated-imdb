In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the French, and their enemies are Tupiniquins, Portuguese's friends. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is trapped by Tupinambás, and despite his attempts to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave and lives with seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later he uses powder in the guns left by the Portuguese to defeat Tupiniquins in a fight. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another great low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The play is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actors perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent and shows a wonderful body and a great performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix.
