If you want Scream or something like the great studio horror product that we are forced on us, these days are not annoying. This well-written film stopped me thinking about everything it had to say. The importance of myth in our lives to make sense, how children interpret the world (and its violence), our ransacking of the environment, and ignorance of its history and legends. Everything here, but not flat on the surface. You could technically call it a "monster movie", even though Wendigo does not take the physical form to the end, and it is even up to you and your conviction of what happens to the legendary spirit / animal. Some standard thriller items for those who just look for the basics and the movie never lives, even though the less you see the creature, the better. The fessend continues successfully George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum, while still keeping us lopsided.
