I am biased towards any movie that paints a lush picture of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, unusual for a while, and a bit sparse on cinematography. However, the excellent story constitutes it. The four ladies start a much needed relaxing holiday with problems in their minds. During the film, they discover their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle they remain in, has an enchanting effect on humans. "It's a vessel of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can see their gradual change from disgruntled to bubbly as the Italian coast works their magic on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and their solutions are likely. The actors were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic Italian location. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
