Overall, I should say that I liked the movie. Some of the battle scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was that they used Asian to play a black man. I really mean. Talk about bad taste. During a battle scene you see one of the warriors on the floor laughing. Otherwise, Sammo Bruce Lee's struggles move perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.
