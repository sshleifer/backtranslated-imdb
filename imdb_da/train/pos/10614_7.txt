Three girls (a completely female media crew member, including cult actor Barbara Bach, not least) visit a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague. Well-made little choker that suffers from some redundant dialogue scenes and a rather thin plot line (it is not good at saving its secrets). An underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (like in: vintage shock material), and that's basically what the movie thrives on. Performances and movies are largely over par (compared to many other 70's / 80's in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this movie is the rather long climax scene in the basement. From the moment the "Keller Junior" character was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close to the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sydney Lassick (who was fun in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and now totally denied in "The Unseen") assumes one of the leading roles.
