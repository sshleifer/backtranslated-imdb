This movie took my breath away on some points, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that drawing the dialogues and the story could have been done a little better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story of a few guys trying to beat a dragon that's not more to it! <br /> <br /> The overall design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's just magical! <br /> <br /> They've put a lot of love into this movie. The drawing design was great and fun. Little Tim Burton-ish, if you like it. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in good design, shown in a simple little but lovely story.
