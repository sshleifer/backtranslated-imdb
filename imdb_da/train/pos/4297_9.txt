Occasionally, a film producer brings to life a unique group of people and lets you see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I've always felt that The Cg Cill was his age, and he has managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. So often we find ourselves at a time when we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. This is a movie about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. Comparing small and large events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are real genius. I've seen this movie a number of times and am surprised at how deeply the emotions run through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline have their roles with great tenderness, and Stever Martin's portrayal of a movie exec is invaluable. Thanks again Mr Kasden
