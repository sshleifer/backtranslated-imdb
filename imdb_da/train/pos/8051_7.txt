"One of Hung's better early efforts. Humor is dead in parts that Hung tries to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also in a bit where Hung pokes fun at Jackie Khan's drunken master. The plot is also pretty good, especially when Hung takes a trio of martial arts experts at the end.It's not the best movie but pretty good for '70s kung fu, especially if you are a fan of Hung and / or Lee. Be warned though: most video versions of the movie have pretty scary There is also a sign in blackface that some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural winner who moves to Hong Kong to fight some nasty guys Sammo turns on his dead Bruce Lee imitation when he is fighting! <br /> <br /> This movie is often considered a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon", but it's not that ... Sammo is a rural pig shepherd - obsessed with Bruce Lee - moving to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a li ll outdoor restaurant. T he new job, he has to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money. When Sammo switches to combat mode, he switches to his Bruce Lee imitation, which must be seen to be believed! This movie is pretty sloppy, in many of the battle scenes fighting Sammo against people who are obviously actors rather than martial arts, and there is a sign that should be black played by an Asian man in heavy (and prevented) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy is more than in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
