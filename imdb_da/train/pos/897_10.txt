What can I say I'm grown up with Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and common family who love and great. Vivah is a trip to a couple who get a court order that beats words and loves marriage. Shahid has done fine work. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao stopped differently, though I felt that the other for me didn't fit the other role. We have seen her in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke Baras, and Main Ho on Na. So quit the other role she is not in. She has been excellent in Main ho on Na and ishk vishk, but maybe she might have put a little more in the role. Anyways great going work by Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we forgot. This year's sweet movie. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, yet brilliant story that's original. Soraj's film has been brilliant all the way, so we always expect something other than him. Good work by all the cast crew and everyone. Lovely family movie to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and love. I give it 10 out of 10.
