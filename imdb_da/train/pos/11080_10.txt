First of all, when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone connects Guy Ritchie to Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new borders. This movie REVOLVER is different than snatch; It is much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I had to see Revolver 3 times to understand everything. Saw this movie toy with your head. It is very wise written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (style of steering) in it. What was won me was the main character's complexity and how we are left with more questions than answers.
