I only went to this movie because I was dragged there and I would have left again immediately because the audience was mostly older people and I felt out of place. However, the film was quite fascinating and far from being targeted at old people. The characters were all very real and trustworthy, and I found myself discussing movies, the characters, and the bigline for hours afterwards. There are a few quite exciting scenes in there, but they are necessary and help you understand the situation much better. All in all, this is a great and valuable movie - a bit outside the mainstream, but that doesn't mean that this movie can't be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. It is an exciting and interesting film experience.
