Christopher Lloyd is fun and truly trustworthy as the "All Head Angel". This film is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first one did not have, and a much better plot and writing. OK - it was written for kids, but adults have as much fun as the kids do. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but it's not a Taxi Reunion. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his feelings as well as showing some real actors for a change, a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> See at least once - it's worth catching it.
