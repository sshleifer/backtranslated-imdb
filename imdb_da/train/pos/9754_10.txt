This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie are so cute. We love to see Ann and Andy sing and dance with camel with the wrinkled knees. This movie is what made the calf with the wrinkled knees so popular, singing its song, "I'm nobodies I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you want to see why it's a movie the kids love and adults!
