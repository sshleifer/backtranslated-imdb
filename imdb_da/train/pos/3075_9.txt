A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, fraud and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who sees part of a neurotic sex object, but does not have the chops to work with him at the level required by the script. But he is such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work. I am very much looking forward to Castce Ullman's casting as the neglected wife. There you can just see? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves, makes his character higher (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's depiction of the only situation where his character is unable to be careful is nothing less than complete mastery.
