Fascinating films based on a true story of an Australian woman accused Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, how the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch-mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's belief, based on hardly any evidence. I love movies that question the media and also movies that look hard at how people are being tracked by the justice system. I always thought that juries should be showing 12 angry men before they go through with their duties. As mentioned, it is not a liberal movie, but a clinical view of how we as humans interpret events based on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A cry in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the movie boring or dry, but I found it interesting.
