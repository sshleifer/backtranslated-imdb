With Harry Callahan coming up this year, the inevitable "old man with a chip on his shoulder" had to come to the end. Callahan, who looked sometimes and out of place, was frail, his behavior was still unkempt. Fortunately, this movie took some time to develop another kind of story that can reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre. While the movie was concise, it was still an excellent addition to the series, although it was a bit out of place during a time of stupid fashion trends and New Wave music.
