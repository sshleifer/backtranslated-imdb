If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise you keep your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I don't want to detail the differences because it would ruin the movie. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a great Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the supporting cast is amazing. I find the quality of the supporting cast one of the hallmarks of a Hallmark Production, and this film was no exception. The kinematics are amazing and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
