Magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With its long, well-shaped figure, big-busted, innocently vicious attitude and pouch from the miggeneration valley, Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As a hopeful folklorist and a person who is deeply interested in the storytelling structure, it is evident that Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of its corny one-liners and large breasts. As initiated by the way the city's children respond to her, she represents the deep youth fantasy of an experienced woman who can connect them to their level: a weird mixture of one-dimensional romantic longing, boyish sexual desire and the desire for non-threatening ease fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of femininity perfect for the boys and a source of strength for the city's girls. The other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her films cannot move past her more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase is for her talents. Almost everything is tailored to a youth's mindset, and even though it's a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with a young person's thoughts can enjoy nonsense. Luckily I have such ability and found the movie to be a lovely charm. Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
