The symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene ... these were all used with such merry surrender of Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other when the fight progresses, editing when the wedding ring is placed on his finger ... while these may seem a little obvious to today's standards, they talked in the silent era volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that love buys, and the love triangle in the heart of history.
