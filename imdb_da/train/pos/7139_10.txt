John Thaw, Morse's Fame Inspector, plays old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and early World War II. A bit of a recluse, Tom has not yet been remedied by his wife and son while serving in World War I. If you can imagine Inspector Morse old and retired, twice as hard as when he was a policeman, then you have Tom Oakley's character. <br /> <br /> But this flint heart is melting. London children are evacuated prior to flash. Young William (Willie) Beech is billeted with the protesting Tom. Willie is played for the benefit of Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care with a capital C. Behind the school, who still wets the bed and can't read, is the least of his problems. He comes from a horrible background in London, with a mother who can't manage to say the least. <br /> <br /> Slow but steady, man and boy warm to each other. Tom again discovers his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See Tom and Willie build a bomb at the end of their garden. See Willie's delight at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by Tom. <br /> <br /> Not to renounce the end, but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle, and the couple begin a new life much richer for their common love. In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a large number of films where the man meets boy and develops a common love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man without face". <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is Thaw's only look I know of where he sings. Only a verse of a hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Robinson also played another movie with "Tom" in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden" based on a classic children's novel.
