The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than the other shows. No laughing traces, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings fun and right here-fun to the table with ease. A mix of different styles that make it their own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a comparison war because it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is its own device and I think most comedy heads will just like it. <br /> <br /> Go see.
