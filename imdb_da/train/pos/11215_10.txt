I first looked at the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old, and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a good job, they must have anyway, because since I saw the movies, I have tried to Learn so much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills, and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just wish he lived today and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to undergo such horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. So from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who portrayed him, please be negative about these movies and actors. They only tried to tell us what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what great family he had. And to all the young people who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
