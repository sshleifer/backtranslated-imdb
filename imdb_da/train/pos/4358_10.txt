Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to compensate for the misleading rating from the handful of bozos that gave this movie zero or 1 star reviews. Each of the segments of this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers ... three of whom have gone to achieve remarkable success in major Hollywood productions. Performances range from raw all the way up to quite impressive, with remarkable twists by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe lamp, and Lance August seems appropriately dimwitted as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But in general it has some good laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself!
