This movie is amazing! Brad Pitt will never be able to perform the show he gave in this movie. Duchovny was top notch, which was Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters begin a scenic guide on historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, the 1960's Lincoln Continental model. Early grace is a simplicity with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He likes his women not to curse or smoke, and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a few artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are rural trailers. Although the majority of the movie is dark, there are lots of fun scenes to have. Writing, managing and acting is brilliant. If you like road movie, murder, humor and story, watch this movie. Everyone delivers and you want more when the credits roll. One of my favorites all the time. "hi ... shave the dog n learn it to hunt!"
