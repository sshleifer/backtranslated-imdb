I recently bought the very underrated Dreamcast and went into town to find some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (a classic) and then I went over the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and have played Res Evil 3 many times, and I have been impressed by all of them, especially No.1, who has to go down in history has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them 3 come anywhere near the Dreamcast trial with Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it is just for the sake of buying a dream series for this game, it is worth every moment of your time and effort, I have never been so excited about a computer game that it has mocked me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story of the 2nd story continues, with Claire Redfield searching for his brother (Chris from the 1st story) who is supposed to disappear during the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella company. Little is known about this company except the fact that you yourself destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys. <br /> <br /> With the help of super steep Steve, Claire helps you unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. 2. The CD allows you to control Chris, that is if you manage to get that far without running out of space in fear. <br /> <br /> The control is very smooth and the movement of the characters is amazingly realistic when the grade indicates danger he / she faces the direction it comes from. PURE GENIUS !! Overall I gave this game 10/10 because it's simply this year's game, the decade's game and the best game in the world full stop !!. Please buy this game as soon as possible.
