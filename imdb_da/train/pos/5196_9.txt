Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better movie than its predecessor. The director knew what to do with and countered Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie that's more technical sound and acted. The artists do not take care too seriously, and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff as he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie a lot and I highly recommend it. Like his first movie, it is welcomed by a particular audience (I doubt very much that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highjly recommended.
