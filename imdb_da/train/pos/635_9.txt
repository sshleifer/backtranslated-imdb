I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19, as I didn't know more than the name of a couple of the actors and that it was a fantasy / adventure quest of some sort. The plot line really is not something that I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated by everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. Despite what first impressions can give, it is not cheesy, corny, tacky or ridiculous, and is actually very entertaining and fun. The power is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or pulled out. The better-sounding soundtrack is magical and adds a lot to the movie, as opposed to just filling the silence as it often happens in movies or TV. And although I might have known what was coming up, I still couldn't stop seeing the screen; I didn't know that one person left the theater throughout the movie. My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie, and as brilliant as it is, I can't figure out why.
