Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slowly, but when the film was on, it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the amazing Atlantis. Along with his grandfather's friends, he begins a great adventure of his own. Along the way, he must end up friendship, betrayal, trust and much more. Casting is great. They probably know how to carry movies with only their talents. The music is nothing special but just as anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
