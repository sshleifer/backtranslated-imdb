Considering how corny these movies are, you have to expect them to have fun making them. The film focuses on a house that strangely holds who lives there. The inhabitants were: Author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee) whose daughter's beauty is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) on the brink to get a little too much for character. "The House That Dripped Blood" is actually worth seeing (that's what it's stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there may be some undertones: it may be in doubt about the question of true horror vs. assumed horror. As in "The Shining", we can ask if the house / hotel itself has little memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time this came out, she also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known as a scream queen, but notice my words: she is a hot foam queen! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something. I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott has a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read it right. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh good. A very cool movie.
