The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she feels immediately off and compelled to adapt to the new culture and to be constantly aware of the angry elephant litter. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance, and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white white themed mansion and the beautiful island landscape.
