I watched the trailer for this movie in the 70's when I was barely 16 while watching another movie. Oh !!!! How excited me and my best friend was. We couldn't wait for the month or so until it would move on. I watched this movie 17 times that year at the theater. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is brash and a little dirty, but also shy and insecure with Babs, and it is so endearing to see it again. When they sing evergreen in the studio, he chimes with his raspy voice so much different from the perfect tones coming from her, but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he's so proud. I could see this movie every day. We tried to dress just as I even had the long shirt and hat that was the one she was wearing. this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to see what they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so caught up in it at an age where everything was extreme, I don't know. The end always has me in tears even today.
