When I first heard that Hal Hartley made a successor to Henry Fool, I was thrilled (it has been a personal favorite for years) and so cautious when I heard it had something to do with terrorism. I've just seen it, but I was surprised to find that it worked, while still being a completely different kind of movie than Henry Fool. The writing and the direction were both dead and the actor was great ... special kudos went to Hartley to gather almost all the throw down to Henry's son, who was only four in the original. As I said, this movie is quite different from the first one, but it works: I joined the change in tone and subject for 10 years to go, and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first movie ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure follows ... and it's about everything I want to give away ... not to mention the fact that I have to see it again to really understand what's going on and who is double crossing, who. While it was probably one of the better movies I've seen for a while, it suffers as many successors with its end, as it seems that Hartley is planning a third now and the movie leaves you hanging. I want to be sure to buy my tickets for Part 3 ('Henry Grim') in 2017.
