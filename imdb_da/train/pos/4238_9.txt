On the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. Under the tab is the MGM character actor stunt-casting at his funniest. The wires are straightforward, but all secondary ones are thrown very much against type. Margaret Hamilton (Aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive compulsory budget) and Sig Ruman (Marx Brothers nemesis in _ Night In Casablanca_ and the always wonderful _Night At The Opera_) appropriate gang trying to bring the two leaders together , instead of throwing them apart as their "usual" characters would do. <br /> <br /> It's also fun on many romantic comedy conventions, which is another indication that this might not be a "straightforward" romantic comedy as it is an angry send-up of the many post-war comics. romantic comedies and their two-dimensional stock characters. <br /> <br /> I've seen it only once with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this movie can be one of those that worked better in the time it was made but is less successful now that viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I suppose this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
