The running man is one of those films that, if overcome, becomes dull and depressing himself. My advice is to see it maybe once or twice a year with a few friends and a few drinks. <br /> <br /> In today's climate of television media dominance and the capitalist state of society, it really seems like a revisionist social commentary after the 1980s boom. Forget it though! There are other great and better reasons to watch this movie. Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting a liners was totally inspired-thety is really play-end-dary (with his rant to Killian over a camera's main highlight). <br /> <br /> Stalker's design is authentic American and reflects the characterizations seen in the Gladiator TV show and WWE as well. Buzz-saw's pig will chill every viewer to the core (as a footnote, why does his death arise as particularly disturbing in what appears to be an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are good as backing muscles (and are Arnie's buds in real life), and it even has Mick Fleetwood in it! What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. Just don't expect an education from it (at least on the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love it. You will also want unless you are a thesp. 10.7
