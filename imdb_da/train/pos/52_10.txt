This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, see it. Although a warning you will cry out your eyes. I do every time I see it and I own it and have seen it many times. The performances are excellent. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and lights. Home theater is a phenomenal movie, and I judge it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, amazing plot and heart-breaking dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Does not give all the answers, but gives many good points about humanity
