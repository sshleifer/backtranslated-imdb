Louis Sachar's compelling children's classic is about as Disney as Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, facial disfigurement and killing lizards. <br /> <br /> Close planned, it's a multi-layered coherent story that spans history to reveal Stanley's own heritage and the secret of the gaps. It runs from Latvia's lush avenue to the pock-labeled Camp Green Lake (hint: there is no lake and no green). Disney's first success is to recreate the novel's surroundings so convincingly - the set design is stunning and without shine. The other plus is in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the book's fat boy, but his attitude is right and he is far from the usual cleansed hero. The rest of the casting is completed just as well, from Patricia Arquette and Frontier school marm-turned-robber to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and having the mood turned up to full volume at the end.
