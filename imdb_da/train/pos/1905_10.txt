Simply the funniest and shining movie comedy of all time ... it's definitely on my personal top ten list. This also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman and run into petty bears, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry add electricity to the rest of the film. There are hilarious sets of pieces aplenty. In such a scene, Arthur (drunk for most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear-pounding threats from a human siren "(" My husband has a gun!). Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving yet powerful grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his sour drollsms (he took home the Oscar for this) and Christopher Cross gives the main theme song (Oscar winner "The best thing you can do"). It's a pity that late Dudley Moore died last month (March 2002).
