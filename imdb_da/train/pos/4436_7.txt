The Tattooed Stranger was another of the rare B movies that BBC2 screened over Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also they live at night and Brighton Strangler. In this is a man who walks in his dog in Central Park, across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police are trying to identify her with only one tattoo as the main idea. After being identified, the killer is discovered and shot in the shot at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie was shot in and around New York so we'll see some areas of the city we don't usually see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Mostly unknown in cast, with John Miles getting top billing. The Tattooed Stranger is worth finding out. Excellent, but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
