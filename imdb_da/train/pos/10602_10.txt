I must say I absolutely loved the movie. It had fun moments, some heartwarming parts, just as well. I, personally, really liked the movie because it is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. This film is, in my opinion, geared more towards the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up. All that is entertaining, naming and not knowing is something that I, like most other young feminine boys, will always remember, and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it is to grow up gay. So I would definitely recommend watching this movie. Probably shouldn't really see it until someone is old and mature enough to understand it
