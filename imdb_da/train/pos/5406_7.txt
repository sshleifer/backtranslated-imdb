The fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Don't you dare say that Pokemon sucks! I don't like it when people say it .... I've seen Pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So without further ado, please say that Pokemon is amazing and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. And also why do Pokemon haters make low scores for all or most of the Pokemon movies? I don't understand .... They shouldn't do it .... There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks beyond the fact that: 1) Pokemon is only for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) people should not like pokemon I think that's why people don't like Pokemon.
