Okay, let's see it. this is a god-horrible movie. The reason (as it is) is terrible, it is worse. But the film was made for a reason and only one reason, just like all the horrible Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the star's voice, in this case Pavarotti in its prime. Okay, so maybe the Lanza movies were an excuse for him to beat women, but this movie is about hearing Luciano. It alone is worth watching the movie. A large opera star, stuck on itself, faces its fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also tracks many hit numbers. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am injured at a number of levels. I'm Italian. I'm a great Pavarotti fan (is there anything about Pavarotti that isn't great, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie, I went out on my own and saw the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time. As horrible as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deeply and love again. Yes, it is corny and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it's all about. So I give this movie a high rating in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and see and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially as he is now gone. Like Italian food that you have never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised as a Luciano lover or potential Pavarotti peep.
