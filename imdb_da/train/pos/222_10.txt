A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from the beginning to the end. The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join his ex-partner (the late Oscar winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthaus's agent and nephew and the two have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthaus's grumpy character - he is just the same as he always is, and yet also very different. Burns, as the absent-minded old man, is as fun as Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want some biscuits? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: What about a regular cracker? Matthau: I'm not getting ready. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay Matthau: They're in the closet in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> What about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I did black, they knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! All in all, a refreshing, hilarious, sweet, cordial, warm and trustworthy character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes from time to time. <br /> <br /> They don't make them any more like this! At a time when all the latest comedies are raw, young and stupid, it leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is - fun characters, smart and fun dialogue and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best camera competencies all the time, right up there with "planes, trains and cars", "deadly weapons" and "the hard road". <br /> <br /> You may find it difficult to find this rental or TV, but believe me it will be worth your while! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 Stars. - John Ulmer
