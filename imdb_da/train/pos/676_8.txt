'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It is not just a disaster film, not just an exploration of Australian aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple legal drama. Writer / Director Peter Weir manages to take these items to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking movie with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier that you will remember years later. When the lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) over an aboriginal death, which he may or may not be directly responsible for, he finds himself not only struggling to get the truth from Lee, but the sense of what he hears when it comes. As with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - everyday life and dream time, the truth exists at two completely different levels, with ramifications more disastrous than Burton could ever have imagined. <br /> <br /> No doubt why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered because of its enduring mystery. We are headed along the same road, but forced to find answers to ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can piece everything at the end of the movie. But even with all the information, we must choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal realities. On the production side, Weir uses his budget to great effect, gradually building a sense of judgment in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound. The random music is unobtrusive and never tries to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement audience will undoubtedly feel as he tries to lift the mystery. David Gulpilil brilliantly portrays a man caught between two worlds who want to do the right thing, but afraid he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a well-known name in the thirty-year cinema. Highly recommended.
