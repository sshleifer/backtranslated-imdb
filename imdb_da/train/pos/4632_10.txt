Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, the author / director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini-feature "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This 1 hour 53 minute comparative epic is another fine romantic drama in which we deal with tragedies and celebrate the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our security zone and be informed about real life and agony elsewhere in order to love equity. <br /> <br /> While "Yossi & Jagger" focused on a couple of gay lovers in the Israeli military silence, "Ha Buah" is centered on a group of civilian friends, both straight and homosexual, sharing a unity in the heart of Israel's generally gay, but not always gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv. "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic border control scene, where Noam (Ohad Knoller Yossi from "Yossi & Jagger") first meets beautiful young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance blossoms soon ?? But in the political climate, the opportunities must be quickly grasped or lost. <br /> <br /> From here we follow the intricate interaction between the members and lovers of the housewives and the inevitable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow the sound of this movie, you will have no reason to be disappointed at the end. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack to "Ha Buah" is vibrant and the pictures are both beautiful and sharp ?? i.e. real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you relax and appreciate the world's cinema at best.
