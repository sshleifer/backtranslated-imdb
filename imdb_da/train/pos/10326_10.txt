We talk so often about cinema brands - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, a movie is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.). This film is not only exciting but also seriously exploring the exploitation of developing countries by American imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. <br /> <br /> It also had the biggest soundtrack in movie history (until of course Queen's amazing work on Flash Gordon). Although it is a little rare, this movie is worth finding out - it will pay 10 times for your search.
