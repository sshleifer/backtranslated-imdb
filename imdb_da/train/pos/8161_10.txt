When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gyro scenes, as the dentist has lots of gyro scenes. That's why it has an R18 rating. It's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the pool man. It is best to go to your dentist "before" you see this. But if you do not like to go to the dentist already, then it is best not to look at this as you might be dismissed for life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge in what I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler), pulling out all his cheating teeth and cutting out his tongue without anesthesia? Overall fantastic flick but not for everyone.
