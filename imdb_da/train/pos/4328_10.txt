I purchased the DVD of this version to compare to the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to TV, and who died this year (2005). I remember well, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and moving music. (Music in the 2005 version is far more discreet, but much narrative.) Just to download other commentators on a few points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's girlfriend, not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in any edition, nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Read the book now! It's not perfect, and the sentimentality can make you twist at times, but I don't hesitate to cry - and laugh!
