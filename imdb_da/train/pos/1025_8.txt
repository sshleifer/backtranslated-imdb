My review refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG-1, which is wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast went through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! Beginning around season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different. The series follows the adventure of a team of people (and a foreigner) who regularly wake up in a planetary transport device called "Stargate". The background of the series is based on the characters and events in the movie "Stargate", where the device was discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. The episodes are light (innocent and easy to see) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made for large sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and excellently executed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue has flourished with incredible humor and humor. They are simply fun to see. <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere around Season 5, the series began to evolve into a continuing story based on fighting a single enemy (Goa'uld, then the Ori). The borders become more complex (much more political / strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as big as ever, but the show was different. One thing to mention is to see the episodes that reminded the 100th and 200th episodes. They are simply not forgetting the shows. They display the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.
