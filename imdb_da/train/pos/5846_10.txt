It was 7:30 am, too close to school to see very often. Animation & computer graphics were spectacular for the time being. The idea of ​​cowboys & ordinary people dull throwing around space vehicles & robots was amazing. Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is really boring in DVD format. The views are all basically identical. When you see non-sequential episodes on a DVD, you are stoned by disk number 3. With today's standards, the animation is spotty. We do not notice computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny characters are instead. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the heroines. They were much more credible, took more seriously than modern heroines and were not corny. They actually saved men.
