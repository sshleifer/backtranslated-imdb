Right after the end of 2. World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to cure the shift between the UK and the United States. At that time there were a lot of "overpaid, over sexy and here" kind of comments. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of ALL time. It has everything. I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons, and even though I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears on many points throughout. <br /> <br /> Was it the magnificent play, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows. But * DO * see it and you will see what I mean.
