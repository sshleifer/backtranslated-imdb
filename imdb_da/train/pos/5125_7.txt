I bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised. Having suffered through "Saturday Night Foolishness" I had no desire to see a re-husband in some south Texas barnyard .... and I didn't. John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger was as always a pleasure. * Love the woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and it comes from a guy who can't be the sound of country music]. A fun movie all the way.
