I just saw Antwone Fisher at BRAVO. What a great movie and amazing young man. This movie is a must see for anyone who is concerned with how to overcome child abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington puts an outstanding performance as well as the young man playing Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alarm - Feel good and tearful. The most intriguing moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away by 2 months. And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his violent foster mother and sister. I watched this movie in Bravo in 2008 and only wish I had known it many years ago. Absolutely a movie to be added to my DVD collection.
