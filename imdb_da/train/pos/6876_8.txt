"Groove Tube" was originally shown on video in the first "theaters" here in Boston. In a room there were TV screens on high stands, with old cinema seats, in small groups against screens. There were old fridges fitted with Pepsi, and baskets of York Peppermint Patties. In another smaller room there were no seats, just big pillows. It was the 'smoking' room, that is, people were loud in there. This action was only added to the video's hilarity. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent seer"; the scenes I liked most and remember this day are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / CEO PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker w / nude runs through the forest, Finger Ballet on It was eventually revealed to be a naked body of a woman. The last one was much reminiscent of the late, incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now I have lost a lot of readers who are under the age of 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??") but believe me, these are funny things. One of the reasons I was a "frequent viewer" was that I and my friends would bring other "Groove Tube" virgins to see it. We wanted to sit and watch the virgins faces like "Safety Sam" PSA would play. As the camera slowly zooms in on "Sam", we'll wait for it "OH!" of recognition on the 'virgin' face. Each time was more hilarious than the last. And then "virgin" would then bring a friend to see the show and repeat what we had done. To get this joke, watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of it is dated, but most movies, movies, TVs and now videos. Just look at a video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw "Groove Tube" in a theater as a movie, a grainy transfer from the original video. It had been cut and lacked some of the original high-point scenes. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, prompted immediate remarks, "It's the Groove Tube" guy, so it was a Chevy precursor. <br /> <br /> I can't look at a jar of shortcuts without hearing the voice, "coat your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy-Lube shortening ..." and think of "Kramp Holiday Loaf" recipe. I always make myself laugh at the needs of the bakery in the middle of the merchant. The early 70's were amazing times; "Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really 'got' the humor of the times. It offered a 'hip generation', humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
