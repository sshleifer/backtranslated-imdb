......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Don't make me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new topic for Bollywood. The subject was accepted, but it is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has the number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "movie" way. There are some very small plot holes. The movie ends when Rani has her abortion, where you feel that you see something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. The action could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes lets you down. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is written so well that you welcome every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was sufficient. Throughout the film you feel for her character most, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is the picture perfect. Out of the three she gives everyone a run for their money. It is surprising how she can be as convincing when she is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons I rate her high. The support molding is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no bearing on the plot, but I found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title song is my favorite of them along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the world view) are two songs that perfectly match the movie. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been truncated while No. 1 Punjabi came over boring, even though it had good dancing. Otherwise, the film is definitely worth watching.
