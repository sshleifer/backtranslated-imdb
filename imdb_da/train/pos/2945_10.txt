I watched this movie a couple of times in the 90s and almost split my pages, laughing each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this uprising is something else. He's so funny. Even P.C. brigade wanted to find this hilarious. It is a must see, and even better if you have the guys or the girls for a drink. Michael Jack's start is like him, if you close your eyes, you think he is singing. The things he describes are true in life, and you would seriously have a humor bypass if you thought it was not fun. My local video stores do not deliver this video anymore, but I will love getting my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
