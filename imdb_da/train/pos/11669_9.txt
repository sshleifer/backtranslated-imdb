Being the prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two other brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all those who has even the slightest taste for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at best!
