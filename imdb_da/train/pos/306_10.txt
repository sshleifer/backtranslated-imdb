Well, I had seen "They all laughed" when it came out in <br /> Europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. I've just seen it again on the tape, almost twenty years after. Bogdanovich has a genuine heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a friendly sympathy that is hard not to feel too. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and pretty good editing too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do, sometimes. Go get it.
