Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has made many guest places and advertisements here in Canada. Finally, someone has a sense to create a show for her. The supporting case also seems quite good. I have now seen the pilot several times, and I still find it refreshing. Although I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show in 2004. (I may be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It's a new idea and hopefully it's going well. Too bad this could not be paired with Corner Gas. Now I know that corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be good companion.
