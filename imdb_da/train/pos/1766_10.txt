I got a free entry to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. The principle seemed silly, and I assumed that it would be very low fun-fun virgin humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard I shouted at some of the jokes. This movie is a must see for everyone with an open mind and a little twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) raw, and the sex discussion is about as graphic as you find everywhere. What is great, however, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My boyfriend and I loved it both. Steve Carell is awesome, but (like The Office) really supports the movie. All signs have their faults, but they also have depth and equality. Everyone pulls their weight, and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it'll be up there with Office Space for replays and quotable lines.
