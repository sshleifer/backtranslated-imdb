Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole movie. It is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that would give you the same feeling that The Lion King did. The story, for those who have not read the other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect the events of the original Lion King. In fact, there are some very funny jokes in movies. My favorite part is when they show Simba the couple. But for me, the worst parts must be when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly to interfere in the events of the original. I can never look at the "Circle of Life" or "Can you feel the love tonight" sequences the same way again (I'm okay with "I just can't wait to be king"). <br /> <br /> The voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, like Matthew Broderick, the guy who does Rafiki and the hyenas. Even the actor who makes young Simba sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas to me. But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu? He literally had only 2 lines, and it wasn't much needed either. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add the talent even though you still can't hear Timon's mother's voice and don't think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to fit into the original, one is going to be when they are pride at the end. How did they have time to look after the first battle with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD itself is concerned, you can't help but feel that it is especially bad for a 2 disc set. They could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the first disk. I enjoyed the "Who Will Be the King of the Jungle" game, though it's the most shameful example of cross promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are actually difficult. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie, but not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
