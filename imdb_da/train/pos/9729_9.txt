Weak start, solid middle, great finish. It is, nevertheless, my impression of this movie. I liked Simon Pegg in the two movies I watched him in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. However, his role here took quite a different turn. Showing his scope as an actor, but nonetheless, I really do not like the character as he was portrayed in the beginning. There is a kind of humor I call "frustration comedy." Its supposed "jokes" and whites are really nothing but painful and awkward moments. Much like the prayer character Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comic actors who also reproduce similar characters. I don't mean to bash them here, it doesn't. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you're like me and you don't like smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg just shows such characteristics to the first third of this movie. It gets better though. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's history continued to be annoying and became a kind of triumph of the "little guy" in the last third. I don't need all the movies to be sugar and light --- but randomly, as this movie got better, it also began to become more and more a happy end. <br /> <br /> Seeing an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, was also a pleasure to play so masterfully. I liked "Iron Man" but was sad by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. Pure personal taste, of course, when his action in it was amazing. Nevertheless, he was a marvel here as the greatest vision of man, Sharp's publisher. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late and missed the start.
