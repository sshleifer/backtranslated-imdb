Imagine which school would have been like in a world like this: kids are a big gang that has really good taste in music and unites with bad leaders and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place in that world. It's like a Ramones record comes alive. The characters are all as stupid, innocent and charming as Ramones' songs, and the music itself is of course fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with this late 70's classic, where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. As a remake seems to be in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will be lost along the way and replaced by vulgar, half-matched dick jokes, which Bill Hicks used to call them. However, the biggest problem will be that Ramones cannot be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie, and no one else could even get close to taking their place. So the best thing would be to leave the original alone, as quirky and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hi!
