Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some noticeable goofs, but it can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. I didn't want to fast forward under the film, and I found it quite entertaining. It is sometimes fun, but generally I recommend it. They probably used all the glitter in the nearby shops, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
