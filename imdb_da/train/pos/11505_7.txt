A couple of years ago I had bought (and enjoyed) the MGM dual-feature DVD of the two Kolchak TV films, THE NAT STALKER (1971) and THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1972). When the universal set of subsequent TV shows came out, I was going to buy it right away - but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded DVD-18s prevented me from adding it to my collection; recently I made an online order consisting of a slate of set up Universal Box Sets and decided to download KOLCHAK 3-Discer as well. <br /> <br /> Having seen it now, I can surely say that I did not regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime / horror series a bit: it can follow a standardized formula - dogged and resourceful journalist Carl Kolchak, marvelously played by Darren McGavin, enters everyone's hair with his attitude (confused editor Simon Oakland, long-suffering colleagues, various authoritarian characters, an abundance of monsters and villains) facing the inevitable (and usually supernatural ) Threat alone but is finally pushed to keep its story under wraps - but a winning one (further enhanced by an impressive line-up of guest stars and remarkable credits behind the scene), making the show very fun. <br /> <br /> That said, the quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets give them results in specific and make-up effects, which sometimes leave much to be desired (for example, werewolf the eponymous post and the goofy alligator being in the very first part) - not to mention that these were limited to 50-minute programs and intended for family consumption to boot, rather preventing a simplified and sound reproduction of its often exciting psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of werewolf, he is never seen to bite anyone, but it is something stupid to do to throw people around)! <br /> <br /> While the hero is cynical storytelling much to draw one into the imaginative plots, there is a healthy dose of comedy help involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, about McGavin's relationship to either Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage) - not to say anything about reasonable atmosphere (the setting, mostly, is Chicago) and excitement. To make the trip even more enjoyable, there is a jump track at Gil Melle 'and Jerry Fielding. <br /> <br /> To the record are the monsters that have come across (but not always defeated) by Kolchak through the series: a revived Jack Ripper, a variety of cultures (voodoo, Native American, aztec), aliens, vampires, werewolves ( walks around in his well-known concept by having this episode completely put on cruise ship!), Doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcycles, succubus, a knight's armor who himself kills one murder (the episode of perhaps the best supporting cast - with John Dehner as a morose police chief Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt), Helen Of Troy (!) And crocodile. Some of the actors (except those who play Kolchak's co-workers) return in the same roles - Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both as law teachers), John Fiedler (as a sharp breakfast) and Richard Kiel as two different nephews of the hero. If I was pushed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, I would lean against HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS (contributing Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer) and the aforementioned KNIGHTLY MURDERS - while I as the weakest I want for WEREWOLF (on because of the reasons I have already explained) and CHOPPER (based on a story made by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the kit does not include any additional features: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the many concepts dealt with in KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, and putting the series into the context of where television was on the time of its original aeration or even the enduring influence it had on the seemingly endless race of the sci-fi series that is popular today. In fact, Kolchak returned - in a much younger and apparently darker part - in a 2005 revival; This version is available at my local DVD rental station ... but for various reasons I am not sure I would like to check it so shortly after the 1974-5 classic!
