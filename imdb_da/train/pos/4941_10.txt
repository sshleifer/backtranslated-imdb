I think many people down rated the movie, NOT due to the lack of quality. But that didn't follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts have not been resolved. The ending is just a little too real for others, but the journey the rich characters and the long list of followers give is both thoughtful and very entertaining. Even the filmography is excellent considering the urban environment. The management is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book, this movie will replace you with the normal and expected Hollywood script, it won't. They took some risks and did a few things differently. I think it worked well, I try gently to avoid direct referrals to the movie because it is the best answer to see it for yourself and not accept another's interpretation.
