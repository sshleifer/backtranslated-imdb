"Pecker" proves that Waters does not intend to change its adhesive ways in his age. Many things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, the Waters film budget has increased significantly. This is one of his latest productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has this "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a lifetime in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always visible Lili Taylor), and his life changes to the worst. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not among his best movies, but there are some great stomach laughs here ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). It is consistently wise and fun, and has the very "queer" sensibility I have come to love in the Warters movie.
