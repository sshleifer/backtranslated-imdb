How nice to have a movie the whole family can see together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple marrying in Las Vegas in a whim and then not only breaking the news for their children but then trying to report their respective households (each has two boys and two girls) for a coherent family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two preteens and two younger children, makes the first thing to wonder if there can always be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. The struggles between the children (and a small love affair between two of them) make it surprising that everyone will ever come together. More interesting than Brady Bunch, what is this an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
