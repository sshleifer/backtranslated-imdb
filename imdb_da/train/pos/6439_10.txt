I went to watch this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in a word (which I usually don't use easily): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards, if not this Swedish crew member who has created film-filled perfection in the film's last scenes, when all that is said (and left unseen) throughout the story is drawn together? Just as Daniel Dareu's character evokes so many emotions and long-repressed feelings within the people around him, the film does the same for his viewers: You go out with your head and you feel full. Good cases! The next time you ask yourself "What is the meaning of life", think about how you feel about a lavish experience like in heaven: Happy, content, fulfilled. To say this to Virginia Woolf's wife Dalloway: "Such moments are enough".
