Ted Mapes sat on the front porch of his Burbank home and told me that he and Reed Hadley had the same size in each garment except hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the biggest stunt men, said that every time Zorro put on his mask, he was on the screen. It was a bit exaggerated: There were times when Zorro was of course Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we can be happy that it was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "Zorro's Fighting Legion", as seen from the comments here, is one of the largest series. It is exciting and generally very well made. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a fine actor and as another commented he made a very good joke. But it is the action that makes this movie so great. <br /> <br /> And what could we expect in the direction of the excellent team, Witney and English, with great music from the incredibly productive William Lava (the note here says he was unredited, but it's wrong, the others The composers mentioned here were actually not approved, and I don't know if they wrote some music - it sounds like Lava) and with the villain from, among other things, great Charles King and with dozens of bit pieces? <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy was a villain played by Tarzan radio, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar Rice Burrough's son-in-law. (I urge you to read his mini-cinema.) There is a chapter that slows things down depressed, but heck, it's only minutes long (maybe 20) and when you wade through what you are back to the excitement . <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this great series and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we must thank everyone involved that we see it as a chapter play or serial, and not as a reworked feature.
