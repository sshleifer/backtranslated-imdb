Based on an actual mine disaster, this early German talkie (with English subtitles) is still one of the most effective documentaries ever filmed. With many non-professional actors, "Kameradschaft" gives a cool picture of the friendship that binds the miners, regardless of which side of the French / German border they may be from. A deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone and cancels any parent orders. A fellow man in distress will receive help from his peers, even in the threat of great loss, including life. <br /> <br /> This movie is reminiscent of the self-sacrificing heroism that NYFD shows after the 9/11 attacks. By excluding any formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform knew only one reason: saving lives and finding their fellow burners. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" still has the strong and timeless message: A friend in need is a friend in deed.
