I am not a parent, nor am I a man. But I was able to identify with each person's heart pain and pain. <br /> <br /> This is a movie teenager should see. Perhaps they will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> Seeing Patrick Duffy in a different role from Bobby Ewings was very interesting. And it is great to see a 19-year-old Ben Affleck give his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age that he is capable of profound drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... its first serious role this year and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps you should not see children under 10 because they may be afraid that the same thing can happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and have seen it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
