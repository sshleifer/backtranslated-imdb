It starts slowly and shows the boring lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up on it. Nothing happens much, but time is amazing, and there are many sweet jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious). The film is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the landscape is beautiful (as is Polly Walker) and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes a few liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this (it can be more sentimental, but I felt it was more in keeping with the tone of the story, and yet I like sentiment when it's well done). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a data movie during miserable weather.
