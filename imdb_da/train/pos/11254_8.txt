It has been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I am happy to say that its housed profits have resisted the time test. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, most of the components of 'A Perfect Spy', the adaptation of LeCarré's finest novel, are top rated. Excellent aspects of it are musical scores and the masterful manuscript, the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft, which I also believe, the scriptwriter for 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' with Alec Guinness a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly very good, some amazing, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to see because his face changes with every camera angle. The passage of time and the effects on the physical appearance of the characters are very credible. So much so I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of the film. The only scream comes after Magnus Pym's character is transferred from the very clear hands of a young actor Benedict Taylor to those of a noticeable old Peter Egan, just fresh out of Oxford. But this is a minor and insignificant nail on the whole. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty convincing when the text becomes melodramatic, and he must be "upset" emotionally, ie. cry. None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments, except for the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for everything she's worth and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. She has part of the character under her skin, but often shows an amateur petulance that diminishes her as a hard cookie diplomatic housewife, as Mary Pym is. Rüdiger Weigang is great as Axel, funny, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's camp at Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is alive in some dry hilarious scenes. When the yanks have come abroad to confuse with Bo Brammell (leader of MI6), the US contingent is depicted as empty heads that seem to have remembered many long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with American jargon and psychobabble, much to English confused passion. <br /> <br /> The mood and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarré has an ability to blend different elements into his stories, and Hopcraft has brilliantly taken the melancholy but disgusting atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> Not a perfect production (what is?) And yet the best of LeCarré customizations to reach movies or TV to date. <br /> <br /> Recommended for all spy thriller lovers and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.
