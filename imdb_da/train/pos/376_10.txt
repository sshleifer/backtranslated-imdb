Spielberg's first dramatic movie is no let-down. It is a beautifully made film without the flaws of the life of an African American woman. It also shows that not all movies that have African-American ethnicity as the center of history must be sacked by an African-American director. What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it was very realistic despite being based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually he is just himself through most of his films. But in this he branches completely and is another one for a time. But the full performance of the entire film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that the musical version of it will also be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this is because this is a movie that doesn't must miss.
