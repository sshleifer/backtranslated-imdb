They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with a little difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There are spoiler. Not as if you wouldn't find out in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep him good, but it is an upward struggle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him and teaches him the ways of darkness. Discreet. Sneaky. He does not always come out as evil. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because he often creates an accident and saves them from it. So every time you think someone will finally take him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some boys with guns decided to steal them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson on evil. The robber (Ted) was reluctant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had a half conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them now. If he had a genuine conscience, he would never have been a criminal. Then he started calling him Half-Ted. It was quite fun. He talked to the criminals. And of course, he remained 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And of course he was always in full control. They have actually had you favor Satan. <br /> <br /> Very excellent show. It was one of my favorite horror shows all the time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American gothic supernatural <br /> <br /> It's good company.
