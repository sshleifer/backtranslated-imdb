"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story of a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, escaping her choking roots to become herself. Although the title character is artificially played by the beautiful Ashley Judd - probably her first movie role, albeit one to be completely proud of - it is not important to become "someone" and leave the next Madonna (about Jesus' mother or the shabby, attentive hungry singer ). Instead, it emphasizes the following 'instincts and is somewhat introspective about them, growing into one's ideal adults themselves. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! It uses an occasional speech transfer (by Mrs Judd) as she writes in her diary - and I can see I just lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that bliss can be discovered in - oh, I dunno, carry water and chop wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / instructor / author Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut", starred as Ruby Lee's noble love, one that helps her cure her idea of ​​relationships implanted from youth. <br /> <br /> But not even his character is the answer to Ruby Lee: There is no external hero imposed on her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold", did a fantastic job showing that a young woman grew into herself - confronted old challenges with good evil along the way. <br /> <br /> The support aids are also star, and the music used, especially the cuts of chanteuse Sam Phillips (which I hear is T. Bone Burnett's wife), is just about - especially "trying to hold on to the ground "Now, when I hear the first chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, Pavlovian and the unbidden - not sure whether it is the music or the indelible link to the movie's quiet and charming authorization. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended to any young person trying to find his way. For any woman of any age it is a must see! The downside: It is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish. (We learned, however, that it is legal to make a copy of a VHS version that can be easily found online. My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and got a DVD copy for me.) movies occasionally appear in the air ?? on an indie channel, usually ?? You can't count on it when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the world's pressures. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a major re-release and it would be if I was the Queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
