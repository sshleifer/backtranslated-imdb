This is far more than the charming story between middle-aged man who discovers ballroom dances (even if it is). It is the story of a person who learns to love life again and push past all the pressure of work and money to discover joy again. The bonus of this film is a fascinating insight into modern Japan's slowly changing attitudes to everything from ballroom dance to physical contact. There are scenes that make you laugh out loud ... a couple where you want to go up and tango ... and many others where you just want to feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who may be under the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
