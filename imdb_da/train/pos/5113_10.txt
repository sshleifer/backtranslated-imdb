This movie was a classic. I must say that this movie was best by a working man who learns from his mistakes. If we could all come together and learn how everyone in this movie did. It had an important role to show how the family is an important part of life and how pride can make you lose something important in life if we cannot find a "GREAT FAITH" and swallow is pride.
