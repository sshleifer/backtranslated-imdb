This show has all the typical characters of a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's set in the 70's. It's the only difference it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want sex with you. (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you are a pervert. (Audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (Audience bowl and applause) "This is not fun. I think if they didn't laugh (I don't know how to call it in English, sorry), you wouldn't laugh at all. This is not intelligent comedy, it is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but it's not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)
