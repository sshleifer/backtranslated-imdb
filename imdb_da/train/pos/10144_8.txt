But the fun is in the journey. I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads very easy on the eyes, humor from the supportive caste and the jokes made me laugh a lot more times. Yes, it's predictable and yes it's a clich√© romantic comedy. But the point is that it is a sweet story, the message of finding your one true love also calls true in many ways. The dialogue is dead and the play is well done on all parts and over the top for cartoon effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress who deserves reverence! For those who panned it to be predictable - If you want a movie with phrases that keep you guessing ... then you will have a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth doing everything along the way. <br /> <br /> Great date movie, great movie for a good cry ...
