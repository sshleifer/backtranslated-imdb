The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason for seeing this flick. Why she never became a major store can never be known. But she is unusual and steals every scene she is in. Garson Rabbit dishes this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro particularly memorable. A "9" out of "10."
