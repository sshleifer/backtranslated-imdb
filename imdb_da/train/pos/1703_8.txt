Being from a small town in Illinois itself, I can instantly relate to this movie. Given the era it was made in, the urban population looks uncomfortable like many people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes, Acting won't be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But it's not the intention. The point is to suspend reality and just have fun. And this movie has fun aplenty. From the greedy, eerie banker to the well-meaning but dimwitted deputy, this movie was made to poker fun on the sci-fi genre and the small town that lives best. Who can't smile at the sight of Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid? and I LOVED FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I grew up. Overall, considering the technology they had at that time, this is a pleasant threat in your childhood when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand and laugh at the sound of small town living. This is a movie I want to see over and over again if it's nothing but poke fun on myself and my little town.
