Another of the movies you hear about from friends (... or read about on IMDb). Not many fake notes in this. I could see pretty much everything here that is actually going on with a young girl flying from a dead end town in Tennessee to Florida with all her worldly possessions in an old car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, does some false starts but learns from them. I found myself wondering why, why she no longer leaned on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a nice movie. The only thing I don't really like about it, I think is the title.
