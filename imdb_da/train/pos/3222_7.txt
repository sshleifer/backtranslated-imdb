The first two sequences of this film create the two conflicts: the thematic conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity and the physical conflict between Todd and his biotech replacement. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways. The folks manuscript falls a bit by solving the first of these arcs halfway through the film, which means the other half is a little more than a simple act. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, kudos to decision makers to create a genre action piece with heart and even a little soul and especially to Kurt Russell, who communicates a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> Not a big movie but a worth seeing.
