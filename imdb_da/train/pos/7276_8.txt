When I rented this movie I thought I should watch a horror movie. However, there is a little horror in this typical 70's mystery drama directed by strange James T. Flocker. Cozy Matt Boston carries the picture with its fine performance, and the typical strange atmosphere of Flocker's film is ubiquitous.
