First of all, the film is a brilliant work of art (film). The reason was filled with surprises, a small child pretending to be an adult raising a million dollars and how he uses it. I mean, that's how it's been. Walt Disney really spoiled himself this time. Comedy is most of the expected times, but the other times unexpected. I mean, this movie was OK or was this movie OK. It also teaches a lot about wise youth, and I am very clever and a little bit of smart pants. But it also sucks. How can a guy like the child get a hot police baby and his father let him go free. It's like letting a killer go for ten years. If I were to do that, I'd be beaten with a "suble jack" (a giant stick sticking when used to bench your pops really hard). That child is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when making this movie, but it is still not perfect. The action was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry nor the father, but the bridges were excellent. The special effects, on the other hand, were paralyzed. Plus, this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved it at the same time.
