This is an excellent, fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which for 85 minutes leaves the supernatural and presents us with something even more frightening - human evil. We are far more likely to meet Jackson Rippner's benign evil than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a social, friendly and even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, from The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film is at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is on a small scale, not the wide sweep of the canvas, and it is no less convincing for these limitations. The kinematics is nothing special, although of course you can only do so much with a camera in a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story is tight. There are no distractions, no subplots confuse the question, which in its heart is a battle between the main characters. By keeping focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven can take what is a very minimal plot and make it an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.
