Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I have always believed his real brilliant lies in physical comedy. This is not to say that he is a fantastic, talented actor: the bozos at the Academy Awards do not seem to like him much, he has never had a (really deserved) nomination or prize. Well, any "institution" nominating for 11 Oscars, a drilling like "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> On with the review. "The Grinch" is the cutest, best-looking, best-acted, more enjoyable season movie since "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both films also seem very similar to their highly stylized sets and the prerequisite for someone stealing Christmas. Both get their main actors to act like the bad guys (one more than the other), both packing a strong moral lesson, and both are really funny. <br /> <br /> It is until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and The Grinch is a human. But a man who is so incredibly expressive, so fluent in his movements, so cartoonish, so unreal that it never gets in the way of the movie. He can be fun, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately saves Christmas. I loved this movie for bits and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of the movies you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.
