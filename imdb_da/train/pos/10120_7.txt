The movie starts something like a less hyperkinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: weird activities take place while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a policeman is killed, a Tatsuhito becomes involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get wet quite quickly. <br /> <br /> An earlier work at Miike's Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual ol 'ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, even though it is not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Rather, it is a fairly well-designed part of pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs its way through the subterranean, a labyrinth that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally acquired organs from Taiwan and holds a nearly brothel of young boys one especially the character that kills the police at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother becomes involved in society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use similar violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate this sordid kingdom. What is especially interesting about this little work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back to Japan and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, killing his father and developing a crime wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearian character, which is odd enough as it is, much less that you actually start to get upset when his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito is going to be. And Tatsuhito himself is a similar tragic figure when he is forced to contend with his inability to control his brother. Although it would be impolite to say that Miike's movie successfully goes on their shocking value, it is true that at times it is easy to lose the tip of how well Miike can create bitter, unconscious characters. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
