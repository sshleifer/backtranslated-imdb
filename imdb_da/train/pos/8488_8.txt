I'm just gonna throw my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes mostly the characters are broadly written and acted. I can't think of many comedies where they aren't. This is not a new version, it is out on video and airs on cable almost every week. Would I see it in a theater? Well, I did when it first came out. It's fun ... it must be enough. Even though I didn't like it, I'd still watch it for Michael Keaton. He is an undervalued and understated actor. I can't think of another that is so capable in every genre. Nor can I think of one that is so successful. A comedian actor who is also an action star (short-lived but still), who is also a romantic leader who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can't think of anyone, at least not in Hollywood. Absolutely no one has been successful with all these genres. I think there is Tom Cruise, but for me he is better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character. But it's not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I continue. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting, heck, it's worth buying as you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less in stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth looking at the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of the fun to watch movies. You can pause your brain and just relax and throw away. <br /> <br /> To ask for more, I ask too much, in my honest opinion.
