Before I look at this movie, I see a lot of comments that everyone has a good view of the movie well or badly ... What I really want to point out is Woody Harrelson's actor on behalf he can't be in many parts of the movie, but when he looks or even intro, I was astonished by Will Smith's and Woody Harrelson's "message" they were trying to create and perhaps slip the whole plot to the end to really understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very sentimental person, I think a good deed shouldn't have remorse or pity behind it. But an action that shows redemption, there aren't many movies that, in my opinion, can show this. This is one of those who can. <br /> <br /> I agree with someone who commented on this movie showing "suicide" actions but I don't think it's the "message" movie is trying to send but "victims". A little to extreme, but that's the message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential. The action it's worth every penny, the script is incredible. from someone who doesn't really like watching drama movies ... if you like drama then it's a must watch.
