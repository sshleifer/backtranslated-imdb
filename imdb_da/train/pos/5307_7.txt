"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a great star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the filthy reality of daily life, like filthy underwear or human excrement. It is a typical subject for John Waters, Baltimore-based independent comedies, showing the weird sides of the American lifestyle between political correctness and conservative setbacks by exploring the background of the middle class in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Waters long-term scene Mink Stole. Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big mistake in some cases and cannot compete with the fast and furious wild attacks of Water's brilliant "Serial Mom", it still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie girl became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable bowl ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about art's arrogance, media hypotheses, middle-class sex fears and the strange ways of becoming pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
