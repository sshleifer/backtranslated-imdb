Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist first-order master expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art. In fact, time and change are what his work is fundamentally about. I bought his first book several years ago, and my family has wondered about it many times. So it was a pleasure to know the artist personally through this movie, he is as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world where the deepest is expressed in his occasional inability to put it in words at all. He is like most children playing alone outdoors (if they do), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they grow out. Mr. Goldsworthy got the gift and the task of expanding that kind of game to create deep visions of nature and open our often tired eyes to it in brilliant new ways. And always with the greatest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk.
