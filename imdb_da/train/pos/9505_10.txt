This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching movie !!!! Ripstein's sites are spectacular, extremely detailed and well-lit, the dialogue is unusual García Márquez, without a doubt. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us excellent performances like the Colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You must see it !!!
