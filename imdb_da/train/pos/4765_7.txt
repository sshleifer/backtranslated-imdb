A pastor who has left his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France, it is also about the deadly aspect of faith itself. <br /> <br /> This may not be the movie in a life, but it is a sin that has allowed it to fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
