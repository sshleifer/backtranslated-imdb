Life begins - and ends - in a typical 1930s maternity / recovery department, where we see 48 hours in the lives of several high-risk women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, who they are waiting to give birth. While the movie contains plot units that seem to be far-fetched today when the maternity wards are much more controlled and limited, it gives us a look back in time to see what the birth of a typical city hospital in 1932 was like to our grandmothers and grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. Odd probably comes the most outstanding achievement in this movie from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace's (Loretta Young) man. What an actor! As the first time dad, Jed is confused and dissatisfied with hospital staff who seem to eradicate his concerns over his wife, as they might brush crumbs out of a cafeteria table. I felt his highest concern. I'd like to see more of this actor work. He had a very emotional voice that was used to unforgettable effects in Gone With The Wind. In that movie Eric played the young soldier whose legs were amputated without anesthesia, screaming, "Don't cut! Don't cut!" when Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling! Another great achievement is from Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. Her character is a soil-type salt, the kind of nurse we all hope to get to our hospital stay, which regularly breaks the hospital's rules to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young also did a great job here too, a very authentic and deeply felt performance like Grace. My, she's amazing in these precoder, I've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress in the last few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her role as a shrill informal mother just over the top for my taste (didn't anyone know in 1932 that brandy swirling from a hot water bottle can be dangerous to the health of unborn babies?) but her character finally releases itself. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, silent movie star, as a grieving Italian man. His screen time was short, but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a must-see code, try to catch it once on TCM, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry in. 9 out of 10
