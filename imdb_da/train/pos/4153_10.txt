this was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip from it on YouTube, and I promised that if it ever appeared on TV, I would stick to the set to watch. I finish seeing it with one of my friends who happen to be gay, and the two of us cried at the end. This was a truly well-written, cordial episode of the forbidden love between two policemen, which I really felt was (in Coop's words) "the lucky ones". It's episodes like this one that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and much loved works of TV magic at CBS. I am anxiously awaiting more episodes and a "Forever Blue" recurrence because I always want to see it again and again.
