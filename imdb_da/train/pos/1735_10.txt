Miss DeCarlo's lead debut has everything the authors could bring - from the French-Prussian war to the American Civil War, the Great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach bandits and a Chinese junk. Just as you thought the plot couldn't get a screwdriver, do it. It is magnificent, the tongue in the cheek. The character of DeCarlos (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, that is the role she dances) is loosely based on the infamous Lola Montez's career, which was the King's Praise and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. She fled to the American West. There is a city in Arizona called "Salome, where she danced" based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced Salome's role there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her charm are not historically correct, nor do I assume that the Chinese wise man is with the Scottish accent - but it is one of my favorite classics in the whole class and DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful all the way through.
