Yes, it is erroneous - especially if you are in Hollywood movies that require many effects, a purely entertaining or imagination, or plot, and you can't actually think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's movie is for the intelligent movie maker, and Insignificance is a perfect example. The characterization is brilliant, the story is excellent, but like all Nic Roeg's films - you think of all levels of aspects of reality that would never have gone on before. His movie always makes you think, and I like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect to get away from watching this movie and feel all happy-happy because it's likely you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
