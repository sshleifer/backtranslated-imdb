Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild trip to see. One day I just searched my on-demand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to see it. I spent almost all the time with my jaw agape. All the time I was either free of thought or had a fleeting, screaming "TURN IT OFF !!!". But I did not. And actually I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. Very artistic, odd and dark. I loved it personally for the amazing animation, but the seemingly vacant story behind it is just as convincing to myself. <br /> <br /> A young boy - good cat - goes in search of sister's soul. In the first part, she is ill in bed and is soon paid for by a kind of ugly reaper. Her soul is divided in half. One is recovered by the cat's boy, while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a little lost to me, honestly. I expect them to go back and their world is ... maybe slowly falling apart? Perhaps her missing soul is the answer to this, because the rest of the film contains various stages in which the world is inside. First there is a huge flood and then it dries up into a gloomy desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to either what is God or destiny you want to see). Then I think they find sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. Then the whole world disappears. Haha, didn't get it completely, but it sends shakes down on my spine every time. Despite that, seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there is a deeper message behind, if you see it enough and do some research. Personally, I love trippy things like this and would love to spend time doing it just to understand it. But for some, it's probably not their cup of tea. It comes out as very disturbing, so if you like your straight forward anime, this is not a movie for you. However, if you have an open mind, I recommend this movie.
