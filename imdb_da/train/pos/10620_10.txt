At the first impression, I found this story to be at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more, I think it is one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but two things stand out, making the movie, even the song, worthwhile. One is the direction of art. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated period piece; Each piece of cloth and jewel (both have large portions in this movie's plot) looks fresh and new, and contrasts with the peasant's ordinary clothes. Even during the love song I find myself studying the princess's dress and hair, wonderfully made. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the movie is cheesy, but the Emperor's vanity (and he makes fun of himself eventually), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince, were all quite funny and seemingly ridiculous quite intentionally. And the sequence under the song Weave-O makes up for the songs that weren't so good.
