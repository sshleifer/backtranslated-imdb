Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences, and the actors and actors interacted with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappear in the pavement.) I mainly consider this movie through the eyes of the child because I haven't seen it this year. Then it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mysterious, and the last scenes (the conflict beginning with the ghostly armor went into battle) were my favorites. There was also a lot of stop animation used with magic (ie people turn into rabbits), which may be slightly dated and silly now. (I also think the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of the child, this is a funny movie and it is easy for children to get to know the children in the movie. It's an imaginative movie, which unfortunately is largely forgotten today.
