I haven't seen every chan's movie, but it's probably the best I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story in itself is nothing special, so I didn't go deeper into it What makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a tremendous pace throughout and you are just stunned to see it. All the cool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump around the couch and scream. It's just amazing! Even my mother was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know this politistory can be a little difficult to get, at least this is in Sweden. But I can assure you it is worth a try.
