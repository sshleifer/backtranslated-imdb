Probably the two most important meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" is that the crazy lepidor mentioned in "A Wild Hare" now has a name and that he derives his famous "Of course you realize that it means war ! " for the first time. For the most part, the Termite Terrace crowd still tried to figure out exactly what to do with this long-haired rascal. It is certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest. <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake, it's fun what Bugs Bunny does for the eternally lovable Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things that abound throughout the comic. I recommend it.
