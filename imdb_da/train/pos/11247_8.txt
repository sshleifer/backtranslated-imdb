I first saw the movie when it landed on American cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head away, I was only 16, and it was the first new wave of music I had heard after being a strictly folk-like classic child growing up. The music fascinated me, as did Hazel O'Connor's stunning looks and charismatic vocal performance, and Phil Daniels' hard but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite person was Jonathan Pryce's driven scissors. He was so out of the band and so harmless and pathetic, he just asked for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the show, when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train. Okay, so the movie is not Rose! But it was really good for its limited budget and for its portrayal of Britain in the early 80s, which exploded with rebellious youth and was looking for a way out of the dole line. I went to the UK just a few years later and found the film to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, watch it. It's a great movie with some amazing performances, and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
