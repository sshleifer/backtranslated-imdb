Believe it or not, Inspector Gadget's Last Case is what made me hang on the whole gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam, and I'm twelve years old, so of course I wasn't around when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career. Of course I had heard of him, but I didn't know him properly. <br /> <br /> While reading, note that I never miss original series (I would if it did!). This is just about the only gadget thing I have ever seen (though I am now obsessed) and I will focus on what I liked about it, as everyone else is so negative. For all of you pessimists, I also have some disadvantages. = P First of all, for a childish sense of humor, you can count on this movie pretty much fun. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought the animation and the sign design were good, and I am also happy that there was more Gadget in it, as he is my favorite character. (I don't like Penny.) Then there was Claw (his voice was horrible) and Madcat; I thought they had been done quite well too. The gadget's idiocy seemed pretty good in place, if not a little exaggerated (ie sucking his hat-hand stuff thumbs up.) However, would make a good screen shot. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that ran in the credits. Yeah, I'm strange. <br /> <br /> And like all movies, there are also some negatives. <br /> <br /> Speaking Cars? What happens to it? You can tell this was aimed at younger boys. It would not disturb me so much if there were not the fact that the cars in principle saved the day. I would have preferred much if Penny and Brain had taken their place. And apparently Gadget loved his car more than it would be called naturally. A little weird, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the boss was just saying to the Gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he wasn't always the most cheerful of people, but he didn't hate the gadget from what I read. As the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> That's all I need to say about this movie. I thought the animation consisted of the car-centered plot and that it was generally pretty decent; more than live-action Gadget movies (slaughtered, slaughtered, BUTCHERED!) at least. Maybe I'm just biased because that's what got me to the Gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe I'm just strange, but I really liked this movie even though I'm the oldest, recommended it for.
