This was one of the very best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68. A dying judge in the state aid reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case was reopened with the presumption that he was being destroyed as a policeman. Further investigation of him as a police officer and a human reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This kind of love was considered shameful and something to at least remain hidden at that time. Although this is not the kind of love I personally support, he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn have been killed for it. The soundtrack was excellent (keeps me watching the DVR) and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to highlight an object or give a special feel to a scene was particularly appealing. I have to see this one in repetition!
