It's not the worst movie ever made, the actors are not dissuasive, and the manuscript and director are not completely inept. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made, the actors aren't great, and the manuscript and director aren't quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. A fun place. An enjoyable, well constructed somewhere. <br /> <br /> You don't have to say "don't take it seriously" or "so bad it is good" or "it wasn't scary". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> The clip has atmosphere. It's the atmosphere that is actually very unique, and the one truly original aspect of the movie, which is personally what makes the movie to me.
