Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic as the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually it is incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is great, but I like everything Burton has done. People have to calm down and stop acting as it is the end of the world b / c of this movie. It should not be a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The finish was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
