Like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better and better every day. This clever, witty, well-behaved movie may well stand alone - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it is truly excellent. In fact, it is clearly the best movie of its kind ... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although this presumption is easier to reach when the main competitors are as primitive, vulgar and boring pseudocomedies as " Jane Austen's Mafia ".
