It often goes only after years that we can look back and see the stars that are really stars. As the French film critic whose name escapes me, said: "There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks"; and there is sky! Louise Brooks! This is the third of its European masterpieces. But it's also an extraordinary movie to be the one, if not the first French talkie, to follow a script written by the famous Ren√© Clair for allegedly finished (Georg Pabst's direction) and to incorporate the voice of Edith Piaf before she was known! So much talent working on and in a movie, how could it not turn out to be a masterpiece? And that's what this movie is. It's a shame Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the states - so much talent was so arrogant! In the film in addition to getting to see Louise Brooks in action, it is nice to see pictures of Paris approx. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice. I never get tired of this movie!
