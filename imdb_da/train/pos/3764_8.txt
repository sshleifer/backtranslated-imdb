Okay, I admit it - I'm a goof ball and I occasionally love a really stupid comedy. While I've seen more movies by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than virtually everyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a drowsy comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated, but is simply fun. A few such films that will come to mind immediately are MONTY PYTHON AND HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANDBREW and Bill and Ted movies. They all lack snobs, but only a zombie or professional film critic liked them. <br /> <br /> While Bill & Ted's BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still fun. Also, unlike the original, it seems to improve with repetitive display. I don't remember loving the movie the first time I saw it - possibly because the other movie sets such a high standard for laughs. But every time I see it again, I'm amazed at all the great moments - especially those involving Grim Reaper. And by the way, this reaper is just as different from Bergmans in the SEVENTH SEAL as you can get !! In addition to many laughs, this movie has some excellent music - a way that it is actually better than the first movie. The song song at the end is great, but it is also the rest of the hard rock tunes - provided you are not an old killjoy like the Nomolos. Great view for both children and adults.
