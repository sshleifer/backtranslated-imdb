As a baseball die-hard, this movie goes against what I expect in a sports movie: authentic sports activity, credible characters and an original storyline. While "Angels in the Outfield" mistakenly fails in the first category, it succeeds in the last two. "Angels" weaves the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster children who are in love with baseball, but are searching for a family, with the one of the woebegone Angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games. Pushed by his deadly father's promise that they would only be a family when the angels win the pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond dwellings bent on turning the downward spiral of the franchise. And when short-fused manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins to believe what Roger sees, the team has suddenly hoped to turn their season around - and Roger and JP find something to believe in. Glover in particular gives good performance, and Tony Danza, who plays a washed jug, also does well, although it clearly has no idea how to pitch out of windup!
