We all create our own reality, or do we? It is the core question of this very original and masterfully designed study of the illusory nature of reality. Blend of Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chic of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take the rather cerebral question of 'Who are we and what is our place in the universe' 'and make it a captivating and fun 100 minutes. The film is centered on Bart, an author who struggles with his script, 'The Sea That Think'. As he sits on his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his meeting at the computer, writing the manuscript. For a long time he is stuck in a swirling funeral where everything he writes becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of amazing visual tricks confronting the character and validity of our perception. Ultimately, they challenge Graff's movie multi-level audience to question whether everything we see or touch or taste is really what it seems to be, or our entire understanding of the universe and our place in It is just a trick played on us by our senses.
