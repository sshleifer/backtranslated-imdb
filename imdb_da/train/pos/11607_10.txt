Picture Bride has an excellent look at Hawaii's past and the people who lived there during that time. The time they spent money and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning for blood, sweat and tears.

As the silence of a storm comes and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the calm.
