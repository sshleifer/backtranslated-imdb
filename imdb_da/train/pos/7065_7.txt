Sweet movie about three vibrant sisters from Switzerland (often seen in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (mother still wears torch for father) - so they sail to New York to stop their father's father Marrying a blonde gold digger he calls "precious". Dad has not seen his daughters in ten years, they do not seem to mind and thinks he is wonderful, and meanwhile, Precious seems to lead a life that is primarily driven by his indulgent mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to make sure her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters get the idea of ​​pushing Precious in the way of a drunk Hungarian counter and fooling the two gold-engraving women into believing that he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of wrong identity makes the girls think that the counters are great Ray Milland, who goes along with the scheme, because he is in love with Sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, light fare. Barbara Read as Kay comes across as cute and beautiful, Ray Milland sees oh so young and beautiful here (though unfortunately it does get a bit to do), Alice Brady is quite good as a skimming mother - but it is Deanna Durbin, a real charm and sweet as a button playing the youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With beautiful song, she sings more songs throughout the film, even though I actually would have seen them, she has even more in this. The reason for this movie is a little silly, but still I found the movie to be entertaining and fun.
