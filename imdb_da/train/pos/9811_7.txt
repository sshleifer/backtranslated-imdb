According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, which is about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only movie he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost. Have not been seen this year. Good thing for Western fans who made a lot of spring management at Paramount, because a print was apparently found, and now it's out in the open market. Albuquerque is also quite a good western with Scott involved in a family celebration with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends to his nephew Randolph Scott the intention of making him part of his freight company headquartered in the rapidly growing Albuquerque settlement. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he is the city's boss, whom he runs from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy for nothing. It does not include supporting relatives when they are villains. He goes to work for a rival outfit under brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all sorts of tricks and he even sends to a Western Mata Hari in Barbara Britt's person to sneak into his rival's confidence. Barbara is great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, his first study contract with. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever made for Paramount and they gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also note Lon Chaney, Jr., who is George Cleveland's top henchman, a rather abominable bully by a man and Gabby Hayes, who is just Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque must have been loved by the Republicans across the nation in 1948 with its top villain as a city chief who reckons from a wheelchair. A particular democrat from a wheelchair had made cannabis of them into four equal presidential elections and he was gone. They had great hopes of winning the White House the same year, but things went wrong, and they had to settle for an ersatz boss who got his comedy in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair as nothing really was made of it in the plot. My guess is that he was hurt and played that part in that way because he had to. <br /> <br /> Still, Albuquerque must have had great appeal to the GOP market.
