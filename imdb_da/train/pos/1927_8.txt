With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which although only briefly, was a great idea with good story lines throughout. Generally invisible for over 40+ years it would be worth seeing again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a version of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, who ran his famous rocket slide, at the point where he was often referred to as "The Fastest Man Alive".
