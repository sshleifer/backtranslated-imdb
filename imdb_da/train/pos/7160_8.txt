A Disney movie that dares to do something different must at least be awarded for effort. "Holes" do not make the same mistakes as would be expected from a Disney movie about troubled teens sitting in a camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. Flashback scenes really serve a purpose and present several mature items that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a little discouraged by the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized that we had to endure these moments to see the beauty of history. In addition to history, this film also does a good job of questioning some methods used in corrective facilities. (An example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes to build character, such as learning to read, will not contribute to it). "Holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. A must see!
