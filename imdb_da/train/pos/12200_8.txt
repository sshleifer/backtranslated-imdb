At the time The Lady from Shanghai was made, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth became disintegrating. The film was so much an effort from Welles to revive the old flames as it was to make a classic noir. Not received well at that time, The Lady from Shanghai has received more and more critical recognition as years pass. Welles is better with age, so to speak. Welles is Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who in a fateful night saves the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park. Sparks fly, but then comes the friction, turns out that the lady is married to stunted but brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloane. Nevertheless, Sloane has an apparent taste for Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie has begun to sound much like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not at this time thinking of his male member, he would have returned to the sailor's rental hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he becomes involved in a nice web or intrigue and finds himself attached to two murders and Sloane as his prominent council. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Welles decided that his wife would be blonde in this movie. Probably Harry Cohn hit up when Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair. This may have mourned him in the picture when he became a member of the study study legion, which saw Welle's vision of independent film that threatened their power. <br /> <br /> Scene player Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby, who is a slimy guy, he wins a corpse. The other thing to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a bottom-up private detective trying to go into business for himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller that shows Rita on her glamorous best, even though she was a blonde here. The final shoot in the mirror room is beautifully staged, but I would not recommend seeing it if you are on a controlled substance.
