Being a transplanted New Yorker, I can be more critical than most in seeing City Hall. But I have to say that before I even came to the story myself, I was fascinated by the shooting and political atmosphere of New York City, which director Harold Becker created. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to the Woerners Restaurant in Brooklyn, where political chief Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There was or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. In fact, it was particularly favored by political people in Borough, even though they had a couple of other hangouts. <br /> No surprise because the manuscript was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi, who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well, and he probably knows how these two worlds cross like in this movie. <br /> <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes to an unofficial meeting with a relative of mobster Anthony Franciosa and things break down and three people are killed, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father went him in school. The story mushrooms and at the end it is reached within the town hall. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays mayor John Pappas and John Cusack, his deputy mayor is a transplanted Louisian, a state that has a tradition of prudent corruption itself. He is an outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he negotiated. <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political chief Frank Anselmo, and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late citizen president of Queens Donald Manes, who was also scandalized. He is very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day, whose friendship with organized crime and favors made for them does Aiello. <br /> <br /> The Town Hall was the epitome of filming Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and underrated talents ever on display. No one is looking at anyone else when he is on. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's best moment is when, at the funeral of the young child, he kills him and makes it a political triumph for himself. Hans is a complex part, he is a decent enough man, but one is trapped in the corruption that must arise in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about the political life of the Big Apple, the Town Hall is highly recommended.
