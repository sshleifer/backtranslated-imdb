As one line summary says, two movies have left such a note about me when I left the theater. One was "Tubes of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the other was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about someone around you, stop knowing what the end of the movie will be and just let the movie swing you where it wants ... It was a little strange to leave the cinema, just like the feeling you get when you are sick and can't think of anything. One of the movies you become one with the guy and feel that nothing else is moving around you than the things in the movie. One thing is certain. The actors are amazing, the soundtrack is excellent and everything in the movie is 9+. Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the movie that made the best and most shocking wake up of my life and purpose in this world.
