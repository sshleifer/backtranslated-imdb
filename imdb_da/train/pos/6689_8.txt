As a cartoon reader who still sees myself as a total child in the heart, I may admit that I may have been a little biased towards this movie. I think there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read the Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. Mystery But was definitely not a high power, excitement-filled action flick, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. It had everyone in the little theater laughing, and got applause and laughing right through the last scene. Silent and Garofolo are fun together as always, and Azaria just adds the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a big straight man while Kel Mitchell and the pointed Paul Rubens are added to keep the kittens happy. Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still simply fun. There are some lines that will catch even the most combed seer off guard, and bring tears from the stomach grin among us. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Though not a full-time classic, it's twice as fun as the latest Austin Powers retread. The writing is good and the casting is great. If you are worried, plan on matinee and pay less, but on the one hand you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us doesn't throw the losers out of time?
