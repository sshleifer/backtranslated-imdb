As her previous film, "In a glass cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and scary images you could ever see. The elevated drama, intensity and undertone of violence threaten the melodramatic or pharynx, but never enter it. In this way it draws from an almost impossible feat: to be so over-top and yet so painfully maintained, to be so charged and yet so discreet, and even the explosive finals are virtuosic feasts of the eye. Unabashed, beautiful and very excited ... this movie is simply amazing!
