Chase has created a true phenomenon with the soprano. Fake performances, rockfast writing and good music make up what has become the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All casts are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch of them Emmys. Anyone who doubts this need may only try a few episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is quite hard, absolutely scary, and you still think you love him - fascinated by him. <br /> <br /> Many people I've talked about whether the Soprano (who hasn't seen it yet) will say "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows". No matter what. Run - don't go - and get it. The same people usually love "E.R.", but I bet they are not very caring for hospitals ... It's not about coherence.
