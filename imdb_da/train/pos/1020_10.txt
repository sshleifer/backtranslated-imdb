"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 via a unit called the Stargate and all the surprises that await the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> After seeing this series sporadically for It's the first few seasons when it first came out, I didn't know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I last saw one episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series. It is one of the most suitable, interesting, long-running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on a fantastic premise. <br /> <br /> This series value far exceeds the movie it was based on, and I think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is capable of delivering something that is not works on the film's time limit. The sense of knowledge created by a long-running series that looks at the characters and their relationship that progresses over time, is amazing and merely adds the ability to suspend disbelief, and that is all a result of great writing and a great effort from the entire crew to the show. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" held countless adventures over the past 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot, and it allowed some very different time periods of the show: <br /> <br /> - The first few seasons, perhaps until 4/5, focused much more on exploration of planets and different situations, as the episodes were quite independent of each other if it were not for the ever-present Goaul'd threat. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th, more and more episodes focused on fighting Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth became increasingly common. After these seasons, exploration of the planets was almost entirely an excuse to replace sg-1 with Goaul'd / replicator / ori conflicts <br /> - The 8th season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes that contain less soil conditions where the stargate is hardly mentioned, but the last episodes have some good replication moments. <br /> <br /> - 9 and 10 travel together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neil. They are both good sequels, although the first episodes in the 10th season are a bit weak because they seem to be slightly more than SG-1 and man / Jaffa lose battle after the fight for the Ori. <br /> <br /> After season 7, exploration was basically pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery of every planet (episode) presented; on the other hand, so many major episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the show's natural change still worked and shows how great and bold the authors were. <br /> <br /> Still, I think the series has a high quality finish that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could continue; the people involved were all good professionals and the series tale had plenty to offer. One last season returning to the beginning, the series was very practical and would have been very welcome, but ultimately it is as they are. In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to figure out that it ends. The big picture, however, designed by hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a splendor of beauty and a true will of the crew, the excellent actors and the characters we will always remember as a collective called SG-1.
