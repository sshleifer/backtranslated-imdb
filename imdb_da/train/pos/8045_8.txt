I finally got me to create mail order DVD rentals so I could find movies that weren't available to me in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and also as small, often ignored movies. <br /> <br /> This one is such a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It is easy to pop hole. He is only seeing him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is an unmatched mid-lifer who hits skids in many ways, only to find a way to happiness in someone unexpected. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not over. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something and he was fun to see. But it was all Chris's movie. I became such a fan girl all the time again. <br /> <br /> It's a little slow at first, I admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited down. But in general, this movie will delight you - man or woman - as it has an honest and refreshing view of relationships today.
