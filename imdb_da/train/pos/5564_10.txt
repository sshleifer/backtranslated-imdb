The best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all Cheech and Chong, this is certainly the best so far. I think I've seen them all about twelve times anyway, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to the others, this covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope one day they can do another because they are still good comedians. I heard that they are writing a new script, so who knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever saw one of them ...
