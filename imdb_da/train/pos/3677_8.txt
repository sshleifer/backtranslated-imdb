Fortunately, this was on a plane to Singapore recently (thought I had missed it at Cinemalaya movie party). Paris, you t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) of 20 directors showing love in various pockets in modern Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is 'Parc Monceau' by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made in a coherent shot and features Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> Coenbrothers 'Tuileries' starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the Metro was fun! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' were hunting. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as American actress / druggie in the 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges' for portraying expectation and heartbeat in such a short time the time was just brilliant. Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a sweet couple in Wes Craven's 'Pre-Lachaise'. <Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual as an actress for a visually impaired French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many portraits of young love, a more mature performance of Gena Rowlands in the Latin Quarter was just as great. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is driven and carefully thought out. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One in particular is this from a cheating man who ultimately leaves his mistress to stay with her dying wife in her last days: "He fell in love with pretending to be a man of love."
