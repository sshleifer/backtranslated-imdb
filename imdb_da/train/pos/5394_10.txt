I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment Tom Long entered the shot - the whole 'bad boy' thing, it was just addictive. You have joined the story, what will happen next time - Joey will eventually get the girl, after 5 years in prison, and constantly think of her lost love, cross paths with her again and find that he has a son ... Though he is a fierce bad guy, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> A really captivating two parties - take it on video!
