A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is great as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is fun as a "trainer" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" excellent. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts a good performance, and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays his first leader very well. This movie is excellently directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first rate.
