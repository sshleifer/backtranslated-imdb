I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and wow! I had already seen the first two movies and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia who suffers CIA agent on the go and tries to discover who he is. <br /> <br /> As I already said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was just right and it fits well with the other movies, but in all senses it was much better. Best stunts, billiards, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer (surprising because of Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I wasn't just action in this movie, Jason not just killing and running. He has a soul and audience feel to him, so drama is included. But it doesn't slow down slowly. <br /> <br /> Of all the "trequels" that came out this summer, this was the best.
