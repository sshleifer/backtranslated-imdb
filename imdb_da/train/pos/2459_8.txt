A beautiful and touching film that deserves a wider view than it is likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aicha, another generation of Turkish immigrants trying to break the mold. Neither at home at his moderately conservative Muslim family nor with his liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find herself and make the strength to be as she will be despite both family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so it has depth without becoming inhuman philosophical discourse, and drawing on Xian Gao's choreographic skills is paid out in spectacular battle sequences. Ultimately, however, it is Semra Turan's amazing debut performance that gives this film spirit. Raw charisma and required martial arts skills are complimented by the heart to make her personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
