Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful movie I do not believe. This movie wasn't too horrible, but it wasn't much better than average. The main story, which deals with very immoral teenagers, should have focused more on the forbidden romance, and why this was ... should really have got it instead of scratching the surface basically "because mom says we can't. " Some parts should have been dropped completely or redesigned to have a greater impact on the situation of the two main characters. A couple of times I wondered if the author / director was a fan of George Lucas' classic American graffiti. Not that it is wrong to be a fan of that movie, but to make your movie look like this, I mean, come on! Worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small portion, I mean double come on !! She was the only one or two lines who actually tried a southern accent. (Listen, it was there, even though her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she were the star, others could have followed, and we would have had a more authentic sounding movie. Oh well, what can you do when you have a director who is just an instructor and not an artist as well. Too bad. All in all, I give this a B- and it's a little generous, because I'm partly to Mrs Amick.
