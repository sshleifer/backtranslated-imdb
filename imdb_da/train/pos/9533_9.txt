This couldn't have been better. The strong constraints on Mike Sullivan's expression could not have been portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance in his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin runs an emotional wheel; plays the basic character of the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character shows for a long time. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father / son story that basically uses the two candidates who are exclusively unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Although a generous man involved Mr. Rooney in organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt was only paid by getting involved in the company. Sullivan now has a wife and two children and tries to keep her children safe, but at the same time pay her boss back. The events that follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a great adaptation of David Self, the dialogue rarely comes out, yet very skilled. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930s setting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered by a dark rainy (snow on the ground) exterior. Running the story is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score that only starts when needed. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the movie is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photograph. These are some of the best movies I've seen; And I see many movies. The scene, where Mike and Michael are in the car, enters Chicago, is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car and reveals Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. It then dolly around to the side of the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) awakening and peering out his side window. As it continues, it loads sideways and dollys back, all around the car, revealing a beautiful scenic 1930s Chicago. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew, the principle man creates a fantastic movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (won him various awards) Before American beauty, Mendes worked as a British theater director, but decided that he would continue to say that there was nothing new to him in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes has made a mark in my book as one of the great directors (in a list of about 25). <br /> <br /> The movie features a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly. Photography, acting and history are phenominal. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's Gangs of New York, but now I'm sure to say this is the best movie of the year. Considering it's the competition (Sign, Insomnia, Minority Report), there's a strong statement.
