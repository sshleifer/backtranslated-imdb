Daniel Day Lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker, who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is great as the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as a father. Worth looking at the excellent performances.
