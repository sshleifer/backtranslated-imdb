At the moment I watch the movie for the second time (on TV) and for the second time I fell into it when it was running one hour already (I think I saw 2 minutes more this time) This movie really impresses as Goldsworthy looks at nature, Changing nature in a way that you would never think of is truly amazing. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling and sees him playing with the world around him with such love. Or just see his hands covered in dirt and broken nails, it just touches you.
