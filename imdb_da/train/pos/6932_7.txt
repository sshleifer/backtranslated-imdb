WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with returning his prized possession, a repetitive rifle made by Winchester. The gun keeps changing hands, and Stewart keeps his hands on it. This 1950's B&W effort by Anthony Mann is more a crime movie than a traditional western, and the cowboys often seem more like contemporary gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman with dubious virtue looking for a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) she can marry. She ends up falling to Stewart, but not until she has passed a little. Winters are the most complex character in a movie filled with unusual characters. Look for a young Dan Dureyea as a nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Willing Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
