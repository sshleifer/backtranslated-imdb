I first saw this movie about 4 years ago, and I expected something funny, similar to CB4. I was blown away. I was on the floor laughing my ass from this movie is so great. The road better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. Top notch-independent movie, "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand humor in this flick, you know it is good).
