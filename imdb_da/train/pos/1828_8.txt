Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Ives, the film tells the story of a beautiful young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic Wars. He was sent to a prisoner of war teacher in the Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). In short, he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), strikes a friendship with the Major, and discovers that his long-lost grandfather who fled France during the revolution lives right up the road! Spirited performances from all cast and some memorable lines make this an above-average offer.
