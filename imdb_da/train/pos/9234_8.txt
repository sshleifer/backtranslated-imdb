Reportedy based on actual historical events maintains this disruptive violent, bloody and shocking period of epic interest for the viewer by creating a verisimilitude that is lacking in most movies set in a distant time. Ms. Bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient, whose unwilling complicity in society's injustices in her day, is revealed by telling sequences: Her witness to the hated Duke's informal rape, her forbidden love affair with a Jew, her criminal rejection to the invading Muslim forces from sensual prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) There are some painfully realistic gory sequences (human play) in this film that is not too bad, but viewers with strong stomachs and interest in medieval history should find abundant interest. Deserves to be seen if it is only an antidote to Hollywood images of the medieval world.
