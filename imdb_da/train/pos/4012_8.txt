After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his mourning uncle's ranch to take over the day-to-day operations to only find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-grave wife and the woman's evil brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, a sympathetic performance by Mark Damon and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not unusually, deep, above-average addition to the spaghetti-western genre. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European babes ever to grace the screen. Here she is absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user (and the addict) of weak men. Damon and Neri appeared in at least one other picture, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good scary movie that is of particular interest to those of you who want to see what's under Rosalba's dresses.
