After the usual hunting scene, Jerry randomly found a bottle of invisible ink that was part of a chemistry set. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so the predictable results arise, meaning he uses his new hidden state to torment Tom. Jerry often defends himself often, but often he has a sadistic streak in him who plagues the cat whenever possible, even when it is not proven. <br /> <br /> Here he makes Tom think that his eyes cheat him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears for his eyes or milk from a bowl. Tom can't go any further, so he's trying to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry fires his paw! Man, I hope small children don't have ideas to watch these cartoons back in the 40s and 50s! I've always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than sweet. Luckily, in comics, generally, whatever damage a character suffers, has passed within seconds and he is back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when Tom learns what the story is with Jerry, and tries various ways to discover where the mouse is located (such as putting Flour on the floor to see his footprints).
