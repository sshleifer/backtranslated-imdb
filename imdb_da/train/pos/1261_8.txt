I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide credible performances and Harris is pleasantly over the top. The angles of light and shots in some of Harris's scenes make his face look really diabolical. The surprising turn of the plot at the end makes it interesting. Not a good movie, but an enjoyable one. I gave it 7 out of 10.
