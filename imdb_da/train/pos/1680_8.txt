Well-made and stylish, while still making sense, this thriller will work better for non-giallo fans to become interested in the genre than the later Argento in-directional passes. For fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate the George Hilton and the turns his character takes and what he is putting through. The camera work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd but appropriate choices and a good non-blown music score as well. The less you know about the story, the better it works. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from keeping this from being a great Sergio Martino directed giallo is that history doesn't have the extra sexual or psychological, or both elements to put it over the top. It is more routine mystery, the characters are well-defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and mistakes. The latest release of DVD (2005) is beautiful and definitely the way to watch the movie, unless they ever get art shows that seem unlikely.
