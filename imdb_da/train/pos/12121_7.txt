Somerset Maugham's characters are brought to life in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a skeletal version of the novel, with Bette Davis' astonishing performance that sucks the whole energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); He dreams of becoming a painter, but is told that he has no talent for the art. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard's fight instead of becoming a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice on the art; Although he was successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also note the symbolism of his disability, a "club foot" (explained in the film). Along the way (right away in this version), Howard is spoiled by waitress Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech when, among other things, she tells Howard that she "should MY mouth!" after kissing him Howard also works well, but the story fails to explain his long fascination and love for Davis; so their performances are wasted. <br /> <br /> Still a movie to watch the actor, including some good supporting players. Bette Davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a "write-in" campaign for the 1934 "Best Actress" Academy Award. To the plate she placed third. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It happened one night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" ******* By Human Bondage (6/28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
