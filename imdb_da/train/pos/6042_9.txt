Running out of movies for rent, I downloaded Freebird. I fought through the first third of the movie and wondered if the rest would be a waste to watch. Fortunately, it was really heated and I loved the movie quite a bit. The other half of the movie made me laugh and laugh all the time. Fortunately, although there were bits of CGI included, they were not overdone or predominant. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say - the actors all have heavy European accents, so be warned if you have trouble understanding them voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and have to order a copy for my own collection.
