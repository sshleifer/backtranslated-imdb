This is one of the best comedies ever! The printer of this parody of the soap is brilliant and thrown, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so good. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he (as always) does a great performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you don't laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
