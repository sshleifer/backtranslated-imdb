Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say a great deal about this series, and much has been said so I will not be the one who spells everything for you again. Just read the people who loved it and you know why you want to see it. The good thing about this series is that it is brand new. There is not much movie - and even fewer series based on the theme only excitement, but Lost lives up to the theme with pride. It's about the inexplicable, and if you combine it with an exotic location, fine plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes), you get a series where each episode is a story of its Own but part of a larger story. You want all the insights into the characters you want to see the overall picture and you want to know where the authors take you. The result of this is that it is a series that does not allow you to go. On a more skeptical note, the series went a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was first written for a season, and when the overwhelming success followed, the authors were also overwhelmed. In my opinion they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and at a higher pace in season 2 and then resolving them (or at least the least) season 1. At the end of season 2 you ended up with a great blurr of secrets, Plot twists and inexplicable phenomena, but there is only so much a viewer can take. However, the difference between Season 2 and 3 was huge. Season 3 provided a lot of insight to partially replace them with new questions. And that's exactly how to write; You will dry from a plot twist to the next, not get a tsunami of secrets spreading over you and then pick up a few to explain the viewers. They got it in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4. It is good to see that such a format of a series can be so much popular.
