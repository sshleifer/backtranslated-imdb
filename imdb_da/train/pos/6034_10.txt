Last November, I had a chance to watch this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was very fun. A few technical flaws aside, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the guy who starred. There is a lot of heart in this movie, very crazy about. I got a chance to talk to a couple of filmmakers after it was done and they seemed really nice. All in all, the whole movie was just a positive experience, and one I would definitely recommend. The story was entertaining and cool, like a woman I have been through many of the same problems as the manager and I could really understand his problems because of it. The film does a good job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are very well written for, they are realistic. I know people like these, I just want Imy friends and I could sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just really cool, I wish there were more movies out there like that. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
