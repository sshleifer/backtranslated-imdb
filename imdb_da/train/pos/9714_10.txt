What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've all seen The Matrix now. The makers of The Matrix say it is 'anime inspired'. Just from watching the trailer to this classic you can see where they took off the plot. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the 1980s Japan and it really shows. Costumes, music and words (in the recent English language version of AD Vision) are all as they have been lifted directly from the era. I think it was made in that time too, but because of some plot points, this didn't date the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed at my reference to The Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the 1980s. In fact, it's something more like the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the Earth's (or "Biosphere Prime") ecosystem was destroyed. The survivors have to flee into the room where the conflict continued. When the planets (or "Biospheres") were surrendered, people began to live in MegaZones - cities inside spaceships where they were made hypnotism techniques and the Truman Show-esque illusion to believe they are back on earth in the most peaceful time in recent memory ... the 1980s. When young Shogo gets a mysteriously advanced motorcycle, it causes him to find out more than he should know ... Garland (a bike that becomes a mech), a weapon from the 2400s, helps Shogo in his escape from it persecuted military. As more and more people are discovered about the Mega Zone, the war comes closer to home, and due to conflicts between the military and the computer, the war also comes to MegaZone ... I apologize if these points are seen as spoilers, but plot is outlined in that way synopsis. <br /> <br /> Feelings run high in this movie, moreso than The Matrix. You really think the war is going on, and Shogo is really scarred by what he discovers. What begins as an uber-happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not cardboard cuts, we looked around in bullet-hour in The Matrix. There is really the feeling of the suffering people can go through after being caught in such a conspiracy and a war. It can just stifle you towards the end ... I know it did me. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty impressive for the day and the picture quality of the ADVISION DVD is incredible because it is age. The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. The ending can be seen as an 'that cannot be an end', similar to the Matrix or, supposedly can be followed by the successor, which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best animations I've seen, actually one of the best movies I've seen and seen by many to be one of the greatest animation all the time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend the ADVision DVD as their English language is incredible and does the movie justice and can be purchased with an art box to keep the two successors as they are released, which will have the same vocal casting. All in all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be kept high and should be an essential part of any anime fan collection. Heck, even my mother enjoyed it.
