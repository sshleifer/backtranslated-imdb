Red-eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some might not watch this movie because it goes to a very short 85 Min, and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just speaks. Don't worry about pulling it off well with the wise and female dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie seems to be new ground for Director Wes Craven. But surely he has watched as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller. <br /> <br /> The strongest point of this movie is its cast. This movie needed good actors to deliver dialogue and excitement. If they didn't have these actors, the movie would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman begins and 28 days later. Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X-Men 2. <br /> <br /> Pacing in this movie was amazing. When you think of getting bored, they throw a twist on you. Fortunately, it is not a long movie and does not want to. Much better than the second flight movie Flight Plan. <br /> <br /> Here are my Flight Plan comments: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
