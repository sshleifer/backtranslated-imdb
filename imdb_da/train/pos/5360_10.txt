Among the standard a liner type of action movie where plays and logic are controlled at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person responsible for casting had put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse (except for Richard Dawson, who actually did well if you could call playing yourself "acting"). I love this movie! The running man is most likely the gift of God to man (okay maybe just men). Absolutely the most quotable movie of our time, so I will share you with my favorite line: "It's quite a part of life's rich pattern Brenda, and you better F ***** g get used to it." Ahh, more people have been called "Brenda" to quote this movie than I could possibly imagine.
