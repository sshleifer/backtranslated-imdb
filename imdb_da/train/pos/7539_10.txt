I really enjoyed watching this movie. Like most of the people who looked at it. I wasn't sure I got it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has made a lot of funny movies; that is, sister case. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't really comedy. It is a drama with comic moments. so if you are looking for a laugh, look now. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. I'd say more, but it thinks it would ruin the movie. This film is not just about white and black race, but also about relationships in the black community. I think it's a chance for a chance. If you are not really interested in watching another movie about race, then this movie is not for you
