House of Games is syllable binding. It is so nice to occasionally watch movies that are perfect tigers. There are few movies I've seen that can grab you so quickly. From the opening scene, the movie just gets you. I try really hard not to give much away to those who may not have seen this here, but there will be a FEW SPOILERS so DO NOT READ NOW if you do not want to know. <br /> <br /> I would say House of Games is not just a great movie but is the best movie about con artists I ever have set-bar none. From the moment the movie ends it will be played. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to bending her voice, she immediately enters the role. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an undisturbed almost uscript quality, and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the film was filmed, in the grainy, surrealistic way it fits perfectly and helped make the movie what it was. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of movies I've seen and loved that reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, the House of Games is completely different in that way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbent characters I have seen on the big screen, and they not only have screen chemistry that is strong and tangible from the moment they meet, but the structure that starts from the moment they spot each other is electrifying. You know something that needs to happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what "something" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface. <br /> <br /> The House of Games is one of the films that can be lumped into a particular genre of movie type, but is essentially a film of human nature. The character survey is not just about the artist's mind, but also for the victim. As the film moves along and we learn more and more about the protagonists, we learn about them not only through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it quickly reaches its conclusion. <br /> Finally, I would rate this 10 out of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite movie, quite high on the list), most definitely and would go as far as saying it stands out as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've ever seen. Although I love all sorts and genres of movies when it comes to movies from the human psyche, it really doesn't get much better than this. Watch this movie.
