If you like Deep Purple, you'll enjoy this great movie with Stephen Rea starring. The story is about the most famous rock group back there in the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are amazing and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to see it.
