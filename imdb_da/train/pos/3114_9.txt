I will keep this pretty short so as not to destroy anything for you. This movie is amazing. From the beginning to the end, it is filled with true excitement. The battle scenes are amazing, chase scenes are enchanting, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow towards the end when things are explained, but that's just because everything went ahead of it. Damon shines and has really proved to be a very solid actor, and daring you not to believe in him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hoping I spelled it close to the right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne. This is non stop and will really leave you on the edge of your seat most of the way. Some things at the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. The end is open to followers, and I hope they are considering doing more of them, for no one has been bad. Excellent movies all in all and a great end to a great trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaking cam didn't hurt any of the actions, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only feel it when people talk and not so much the action.
