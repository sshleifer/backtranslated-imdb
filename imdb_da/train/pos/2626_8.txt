"Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest non-theatrical release from Disney. I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. I remember the first time I saw it, I had no expectations at all and was pleasantly surprised by this sophisticated and very entertaining movie. Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not really bad, it suffered from some problems: lack of a good script and poor characterization, which impressed what else an okay movie. Anyway: It's nice to see Timon and Pumbaa's personalities flourish again as we (or decidedly) loved them in this movie; in "Simba's Pride" they were quite annoying and I didn't like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series either. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been a stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and instead focused on making this movie sometimes extremely fun. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is quite good. There are two new songs that are captivating and two new characters, Timon's mother (pronounced by recognizable Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, who are comfortable. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa has been carefully portrayed. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which it could easily have done (especially in comedies). But is there anything that distracts this image from getting 10 votes from me? Yes there is. Although they fortunately do not affect too much, but I mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first movie are used in this. Personally, it was strange to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. Under the climax some of the jokes will be paralyzed. <br /> <br /> 3. Historically, it's Timon's story, and while the filmmakers are trying to integrate their story with Simba's, it makes for a fast-paced spectacle at times. <br /> <br /> But hey, these details don't affect this otherwise entertaining movie. It's the only truly acceptable Disney sequel to be in every movie collection.
