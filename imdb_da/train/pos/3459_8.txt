Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic Columbo villain. The very first "real" episode of Columbo, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from classical status. Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of a murder mystery writing partnership. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill to promote the books. As soon as Jim has decided that he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken throws a plot to kill Jim. Aside from that, not a new plot, it is actually the implementation in reality of a murder story originally intended for one of their books. It doesn't take long for Columbo to train that Ken is the killer, although unfortunately another murder (Ken romances and then kills a naked witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction. Nothing wrong with "The Murder of the Book", but it's not quite top class. I just wanted to give the "Publish or Perish" edge over this: both episodes have Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish or Perish" is a fraction more tense and unpredictable. But it's still a big episode.
