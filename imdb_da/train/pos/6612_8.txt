Just as Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. Neither film nor cartoon sees this movie as a tribute to Film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European comics. You can see Paris as it almost could be, the signs seem as real as you and I. They blink, turn, shake like real actors in a way that was never achieved before. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it hoping to find a mind twister. You will probably find out before you are halfway from the movie. The scenario is certainly too simplistic in relation to famous thrillers, but it is certainly happiness to the eyes.
