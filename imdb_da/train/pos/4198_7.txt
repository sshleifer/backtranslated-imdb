From the opening stage aboard a crowded train where a ruthless bag is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing from a woman's bag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to see. It is partly because the play is uniformly strong from the whole cast, the B&W photography is sharp and adds to the strong character of history and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, the same urgency as the Huston movie about a hoist goes wrong - but the payout is not quite as strong. JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard-working girl Widmark describes as "knocked around a lot". She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeals to her role as the not too bright woman wearing a microfilm in her bag for her boyfriend (Richard Richley), which the FBI already knows. They are on her track when the theft occurs. THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells everything to make money and ends up paying for it with her life. She touches especially in her last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This one is guaranteed to keep your attention through its one-hour and twenty-minute running time. Good noir from Fox and remarkable for performances by Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
