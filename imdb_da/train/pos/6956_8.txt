I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber sweet. It had all the "sex" content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have, but with something a little extra, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this violent but credible chemistry that seems to transcend in every scene. Both seem to create this odd, twisted and interesting relationship with powerful "sexual" excitement as you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the support aids seem to play each other's roles perfectly, and even Wanda Sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. Although these kind of comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with someone who usually does not enjoy these movies and he laughed like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are also a bit ... well let's say adult to younger viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, it was very weak at the end, which was a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * out of 5 *)
