As Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slides into theaters with a little fanfare and much economy, I get to think back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" came out. Now for all Kurt Vonnegut's talk of being "unmistakable", it is surprising that he has received two fantastic cinematic treatments (the other being "Slaughter Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and I can't understand why. It is brilliant! It remains almost completely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being silent or overly literary) and adds a poetry purely cinematic. How many movie adaptations of an author's work can claim it? Vonnegut even puts a coma look to the end of the movie, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful movie, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed movie, and it is among my picks for the five or best American films of the 1990s. It is a sad, inspired, surrealistic masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see "Mother Night" - it is not even familiar with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as the "Battle House Five" sometimes does). It's a strong, impacted piece of cinema.
