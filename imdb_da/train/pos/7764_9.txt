Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family is masterfully depicted in the Writing on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an aircraft you call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always got him out of trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch is not from a wealthy home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, manages most of everything in town. While in N.Y., Kyle meets the girl in her dreams, nicely played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlwind romance he marries her and brings her home. There she meets her father-in-law who warns her how hard Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. The Bacall character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp if ever there, played fully by Dorothy Malone, who was voted best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the loyal friend. br /> <br /> A year of chicken to Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he cannot have children. That's when his wife reveals to him that she's really pregnant, Kyle, and thinks the baby is Mitch's, goes on a drunken frenzy and accidentally shot dead in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch's tries, but fails to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable court scene, Malone pulled out of all the stops and finally admitted that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Her Oscar was deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and lost in a disturbed victory by Anthony Quinn, like Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was the champion of soap opera films from the 1950s. Written on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
