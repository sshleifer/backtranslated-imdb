This is a very nice and unexpected film. You start by following a young person hoping to enter the qualified football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed in football matches to "sit with men". The following is a wonderful comedy played with the complete skill of a small ensemble cast. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and for that matter the young soldiers who are to correlate them). There are some good pieces, especially when one of the girls has to go to the toilet, and of course the stadium has no toilets for women. The camera work is the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage game. Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. Fantastic movie theater? No, probably not; good entertainment - for sure.
