This film was not just one of John Ford's own personal favorites, but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-profile admirers. Ironically, I just got it myself through Criterion's latest 2-Disc Set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on Italian television many years ago and again a couple of times on television in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film marked Ford's first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a hallmark of Ford's folksy Americana vein. A beautifully crafted and pictorial rather poetic work, the legal sequences (and any revelation) in the second half still packs a wallop, except to give stalwart character actor Donald Meek a memorably carnal role as a prosecuting lawyer. <br /> <br /> Of course, Fonda is perfectly cast as a bashful, inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president; Fonda would continue to portray other fictional politicians on film - especially in Franklin J. Schaffner's BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time to accept Lincoln's role when he, in his opinion, was "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously tackled Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in the PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a stunning but perhaps lesser-known gem, which has fortunately just been released as a Special edition DVD of the UK's Criterion stand-in, Eureka's "Masters of Cinema" brand. In addition, I also have two other Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection that I have not yet seen, and incidentally both were conducted by DW Griffith - BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and I had have not only received a bunch of movies I have never seen before right now, I would like to have given them a spin based on my highly satisfying experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
