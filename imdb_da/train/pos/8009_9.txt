Oh, true memories. I lived in Holland at that time and then eagerly awaited it every Sunday evening and later Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16. Very good for my (in school time) English, since Dutch TV gives subtitles to other languages, except kiddies shows today. So you wanted to hear the original voices and languages. - The best series were the first three and after the third series the great character disappeared, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, from the series (I don't think they have ever caught him, he has always escaped, left room for to make him reappear in a next story), for obviously the series was also distributed to Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not go very well! Too bad because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat who had this ongoing occupation to avenge himself in England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high performance performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart, and the young were so normal. They were very trustworthy for me at the time, and as a child I could just imagine being a part of these young people, who at that time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me that stood out in my memory of those times as a special show with the "Prisoner" too. I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series, it would be wonderful. Even the bad copies around are still easier to see. The later series was not so good, the water and just not as fun as the first three. Hopefully they will also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
