It's really unfortunate that most people outside Canada believe that the only things Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This movie is the second superlative Canadian movie I've seen in the last few weeks (the first being "The Red Violin"), far better than all the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Noble Noble is anything but that; He is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively examines various things that happen to him about his family, his friends, and his work and their impact on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and I would assume, accurate, portrayal of the middle class, the urban life of India at that time. <br /> <br /> But I was a little prepared for this as I read Rohinton Mist's book a few years ago. As expected, the film cannot capture all the book's complexities, but if you want to read a really good book and watch a really good movie, read and see "Such a long journey".
