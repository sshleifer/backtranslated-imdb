In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work and that was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we had watched the movie together. The movie and the book hit an emotional place in my heart, and I was laughing for several days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories endure entire generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was confused by its beauty and how well it lived to the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean: "But when I am alone in the half-light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade into a being with my Soul and Memories And the sound of the great black foot and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise, finally all things go together in one, and a river runs through it, the river was cut by the world's great flood and run over rocks from the basement of time. On some rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by water. " These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (by Robert Redford, who talks like Norman Maclean), are basic scripture, in my opinion. Any mistakes the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was beautiful!
