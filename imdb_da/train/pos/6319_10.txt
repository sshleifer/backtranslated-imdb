Have the opportunity to watch some of the movie in the Slavic Village Broadway area, I couldn't wait to see the final copy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie at Cleveland Premier this Friday, I don't laugh aloud on a comedy for a long time! It's a good slapstick. Russo Brothers did a fine job. The whole cast performs their best comedic acting ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, and he is amazing as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was mostly staggered by William H. Macy as the villain "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto", they keep you in "sting". I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
