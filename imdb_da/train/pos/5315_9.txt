This movie was very, very strange and very, very fun. All actors are quite real and very strange. The overall look of the film was also different, like dreamy and bleached, which was only added to the spacious, groping, strange vibe of it all. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, that's not what you would call "mainstream," but that was what I liked about it. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. . . unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and strokes in the strangest places. The kids are so heartbreakingly goofy (and pimply) that you can't help but feel for them. In other words, these are far from "Hollywoodized" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Anyone who makes me a good thing.
