I'm a big John Denver fan. I have a great collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special as it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and cd. I have the original CD and later release. However, the later release lacks more songs. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas gift would be so much worth it. For me there is nothing worth selling this tax. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would like either version. If anyone has one available, let me know. Thanks
