I saw the parents since I was younger and never remembered the title until I once rolled through John Candy's movie credits on IMDb and noticed a post called "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something rang a bell, and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot collection brought many reminders. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it doesn't mean a "big" comedy, I've found it aged very well. However, it is quite comfortable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of wrong identity and worldwide excitement. <br /> <br /> The movie has a large number of characters, among them an American couple who find a woman's dog while on vacation in Europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival. Then the plot becomes skinny and silly, and they start after the police believe they are the kills. <br /> <br /> A blend of "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a lighter Hitchcock feature, this was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - like John Candy - to that star in it. The movie is mostly engaging because of its cast, and the end has a fun little twist that is not completely unpredictable, but also a kind of unexpected.
