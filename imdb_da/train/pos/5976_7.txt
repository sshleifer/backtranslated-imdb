Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a movie is about the 80s culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies - two things that I love dearly. So as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me quite easily. And without apparent reason Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an unpopular youth who, like all of us losers, ended up in a world of "evil" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metal dude dies, and of course it miraculously arises - by playing his latest unpublished album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to walk around and kill people with demons and can help. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent play (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this "uber-evil" metal guy is one of the most unpleasant, tall, cruel, Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" is a little more than outdated 80's Pop / Hair Metal. He hits all the clich√©s here, from boasting as a gay, to seeing being the means to scream "Rock and Roll !!!" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond retch. Except for the terrible musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
