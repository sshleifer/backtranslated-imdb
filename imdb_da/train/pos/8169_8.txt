This is an ugly mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson has much command of this movie with its slim depiction of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife, and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for the little one, the little "drunk" with the pool guy brings severe punishment the way the good doctor knows best - shame about the beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film is dedicated to Bernson's character who loses it altogether, and the spotlight falls on a young actor named Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented performer, she hogs the limelight from the moment the elbows come out. Good legs too!
