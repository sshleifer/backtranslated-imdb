When people ask me to mention the scariest movie I've ever seen, I always respond to "Black Noon" and to this day no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I saw it alone 30 years ago at the age of 13 when my parents had gone out in the evening. As far as I know, it has only been shown once in England and unfortunately not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can track a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I saw it again now, it would be a big disappointment, but it always sticks to my memory as a particularly worrying little movie!
