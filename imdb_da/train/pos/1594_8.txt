What I like about you is one of the series you should see, but you are not sure you would see the beginning cool and it sucks you into the series just for fun, the second part I season 2-3, more obsolete, they come and go in whatever you want. What happens to many series is that they do not end with anything special, because the other part of the series always goes down the drain, one also something, the third part is the one that destroys and destroys the whole series, usually, but It's not, this end is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, in fact, I was pretty angry at all these guys in Walt's life, in fact I would end up with Jeff in the end, but later they changed they chose to take Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top. <br /> <br /> see that many times the series is actually very cool just don't expect the other part to be as good, it's not, but the third part does what was necessary and made the series one that was worth it, I'm happy to say I was happy and happy with the series and now I want to go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when I've seen the whole series, I'll be back. ..
