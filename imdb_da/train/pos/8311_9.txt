I really liked this movie, it was good and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at his job when you watch him in a musical movie, you know it will be good! I would suggest that people see this heart warming, sad and special movie if they want to know more about Richard! Excellent! Fresh!
