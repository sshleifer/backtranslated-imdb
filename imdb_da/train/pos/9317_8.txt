I've seen this movie criticized with the statement, "If you can get past the moralization ..." It misses that point. Moralization is in the consciousness of consciousness as it was. This is a decent movie with a standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through. The decision leaves the viewer asking, "What would I have done in this position?" And I have to believe that is exactly what the filmmaker intended. For this purpose and to the end of entertaining the audience, the film succeeds. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but just outside the camera. We know what has just happened; It's just not served up in front of us, so rubbed in our faces as it would be today with modern blood and dressing. In addition, the violence is not intended. The point is the protagonist's moral dilemma, which is wise, albeit disturbing, resolved.
