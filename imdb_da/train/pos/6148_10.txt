I LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of World War II witches. The scene that impressed me the most was the struggle between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to see this army without a corpse to fight the astonished song of their march. This movie is great from the trip to Portobello Road (which made me the most amazing place in London) to travel to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are truly a wonderful couple. She is always fantastic, it seems to be a good aunt of a family, and David with his always astonished face is her big companion. we miss him a lot.
