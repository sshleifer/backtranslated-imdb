Although I didn't like Stanley & Iris immensely as a movie, I admired the actor. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are amazing in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to do any role he portrays in gold. He gives a good performance in this movie, and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for older people, because he cannot care more about him, who will break your heart. I would not really recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I would say that you will not see much betting that is trading anywhere.
