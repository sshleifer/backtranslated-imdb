the town of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing, but the amazingly brilliant writing means it works and it works very well. Most people know others with a few signs, but hopefully no people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward, the foreign hating owners of the local store or the pen-occupied Pauline who treats "dole scum" with much contempt. It was only a few of the strange inhabitants. The TV work consists of 3 series and a Christmas salon. There are references to many horror films that the braided man. A recent addition to the reach of works is a movie, the league of gentleman apocalypse, which I would not say much but highly recommend. All in all, the league's lord is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliant bonkers characters. I would definitely say it's worth watching as you won't regret it!
