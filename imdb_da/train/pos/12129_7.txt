This is a well-documented film by John Cromwell, who was not a great instructor, but who did some fine films, including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Seen in a London that only Hollywood could cope with, atmospheric, but nothing as right, it's a story of obsession and confused love, from the Somerset Maughan novel. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD that I had never seen before, and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role that was considered one of Her early looks. So I bought it. Well, she looked fine, but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest movie actors, making no mistake, but here she did one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as cruel as Dick Van Dyke's 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close. <br /> <br /> In the other important role was Leslie Howard and he made it excellent. He was a subtle and intelligent actress. The supporting actors are delighted. Worth to see despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.
