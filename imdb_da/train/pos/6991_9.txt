This is an excellent movie. Cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. The film is basically about a well-done doctor who steals the bodies of the dead brides and takes them to his home. When the organs are at home, he removes things (I hate to use such a generic term, but I forget what it was removed) and put it into his wife to keep her youth. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, examines the situation and begins to find answers to why the brides were dying. She takes a trip to the doctor's house and the interesting things begin to take place. Definitely see this oldie, but good if you can.
