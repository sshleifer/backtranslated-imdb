Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful drive that arrives in a bar. He meets the young, beautiful and disgruntled wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owners of the bar. He trades his mechanical skills with some food and lodging and has an affair with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging a car accident. The relationship between them is affected by the guilt and investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic films of Luchino Visconti are excellent. This is the first time I see this version of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'. I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in the history of the cinema, but this one is definitely the best. My voice is ten.
