This is apparently the second remake of this film that has been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it reminds me of the later movie, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films are about a damn blowing hair that comes to one of the world's top schools and both ultimately show the fans slowly and learn about teamwork and decency. In this movie, William Haines "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And in a supportive role is Jack Pickford - always remembered as Maria's brother. Of these three, Pickford comes out of the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's companion - he actually has some decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clich√©s are there and the film, because it was done so many times before and since, gives few surprises. But it's a comfortable movie and it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better silent college movie, try Harold Lloyd'S THE FRESHMAN - it's soccer scenes are honestly more exciting and Harold is far more sympathetic and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably the best college photo you can find from the era. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is that William Haines played virtually the same unlikely and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (as in eg WESTPOINT and SMART SET) - and If you 'I've seen one of these movies you've seen them all. Well made, but certainly not original! And because it's only a rehash of his other movies, anyone who gives the movie a score of 10 is strongly advised to watch these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this this little movie was the highest rated movie on IMDb from 1920 !! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better movies - how this movie should be # 1 is anyone's guess.
