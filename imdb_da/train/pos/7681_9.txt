Children's sexual exploitation is one of the most serious problems in our world today, and I feared that any movie on the subject would jump directly to scenes of explicit sexual nature to shock and disturb the audience. After watching both 'Trade' and 'Holly', a movie moved me to see a change in international laws. The other felt like a bad attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and the odd suicide. <br /> <br /> Adopting this problem in a Hollywood Tear Jerker is not a useful or necessary strategy, and I have to praise the brands for 'Holly' in order to engage subtly but strongly with the terrible conditions Unfortunately, these children are forced to endure. "Trade" waved between serious and stupid with scenes involving a cat's death after images representing children forced to commit some horrible acts. I found this unengaging and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I had wanted a cheap laugh, I would not have signed up for a film about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to see a powerful movie that actually matters, I suggest saving money on the movie ticket for the release of 'Holly'.
