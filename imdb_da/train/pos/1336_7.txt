This is a generally nice film with good history, good actors and good songs. Unfortunately, the kinematics were poor. One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Any? <br /> <br /> The movie is about a newlywed couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya can't imagine an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who wants to carry their baby. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute, played by Preity Zinta. The movie is not really realistic, I think, is it not easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean the man should sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? At least I think if the authors had heard of all this, the movie would not have been made so the concept is apparently intended. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how hard he finds sleeping with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; She is generally effective and tries to do something about the role, but is completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The movie belongs to Preity, which steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. She makes it easy and natural to transform from a high prostitute to a sensitive woman. She lives movies, emotions and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best performances. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her industrial contemporaries. She just has to do several such roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie only highlights what I said above. It is fast-paced, exciting and very well-acted. See it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for preaching!
