I watched this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and into classic rock (still is) ... I have never seen opera before, because I hate soprano voices, but he changed all that. He was adorable in the movie and had such a great voice. <br /> <br /> I listened to CNN that he died tonight at home with pancreatic cancer he will be missing and he has certainly left his mark on this world. I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, see and enjoy. * smile * Maybe I should go over to Amazon.com and look before it's sold out.
