If you are a fan of Altman's large ensemble casts, as shown by big movies like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park and lesser-watched movies like A Wedding, you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH. Centered on a health convention where two women run for president, HealtH contains many of Altman's last 70s such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the movie), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, while also including top stars Altman novices like Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman ensemble films, there are many sub-spots in this movie, but it's almost as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding, but it has a more centered feel, perhaps as M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. It's all an obvious satire on the health movement, filled with over-top, outlandish, contradictory characters, with guest stars like Dick Cavett giving a sharp comment to it all. Emphasizing the whole electoral process is Altman's characteristic pessimism of politics and public appeal, but what is most appealing about this movie is the right fun that most seem to have. This would be one of Altman's last films like this for a while!
