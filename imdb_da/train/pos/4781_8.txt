MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the final fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius, for he is not just a film maker. His stories and his style have a spell that crosses the screen. So the fair story was a surprise to me, with it's easy to follow history and sunny set. Still, Lynch is there, and although this is far from its best, it is a movie that must not be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
