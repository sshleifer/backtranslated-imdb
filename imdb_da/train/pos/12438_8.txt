The movie was a long-awaited release, where it was a little disappointing because of the expectation I had set up. When I look at it again, I have to say it is actually quite OK. First of all, it is very true for the original story (of course not quite) and as such is only done to keep the right to the film. Modesty story as a child is shown and is very true to the original. The play may not be the best, and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie, it is better just because it is not trying to be a musical. Generally, I would only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or to anyone who catches it on the TV.
