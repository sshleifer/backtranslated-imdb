With all the violence on TV and in the local news, it is refreshing to have a show that does not have violence or adult language but is still entertaining. My kids look forward to seeing us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judge. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and spices. We play together at home to guess who the winner will be. <br /> <br /> It's an amazing hour of entertainment as well as informative. Best of all in our hussle, bussle life, it's an hour family spend together.
