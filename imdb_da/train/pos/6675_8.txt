The management behind this movie was great for a comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be out of a cartoon and much darker (visually - not historically wise) than expected. Granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are in very raw sexist jokes as this has very little of it (compared to others like something about Mary or American Pie). When you see it again, several jokes separate and become more fun. If you've ever read a cartoon or seen a cartoon movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and like them, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. If you didn't like them, you might like the respectable ridicule that this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, the DVD has some great extra features. (8/10)
