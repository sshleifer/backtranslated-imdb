This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts, and undoubtedly Christine McIntyre's best trio performance. She is good in a number of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her song is not fun at all, in fact it is beautifully beautiful, but the plot is designed in such a way that the song improves humor rather than detracting from it. We listen to McIntyre singing the whole Spring's Voice no less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we are not tired of her voice, and partly because it interferes so well with Stooges' antics. The use of operative soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of Kitty Carlisle's role in Marx Brothers' "Night at the Opera", but the song is much more a part of the comedy here than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more in other performances than here. ) exhibited his own talent that Carlisle never did. Stooges' buffoonery, McIntyre song and a well-built plot combine to 5 out of 5 stars.
