Envy, like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other amazing misconceptions, has amazing performances by two actors who play essentially losers (may be too hard a word I want to call them suburbs). <br /> <br /> This movie was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I look forward to seeing a great studio comedy that is not filled with blatant humor, and I think the little moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look of Stiller's face when he sees the dog disappear for the first time, captures a moment, a moment that most people must recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a pretty simple story, but it explored the reason for envy in a really interesting way. There were many beautiful scenes (J-Man's detached "cottage by the lake", Corky's invisible funeral, Weitz's royal court and Walk's J-Man - all the good things. <br /> <br /> I can't stand people who get against IMDb and relentless garbage movies when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to do one, I will envy almost any of the top ten gross comedies of the year (except Napoleon Dynamite.) It's wittier, wackier And an offbeat enjoyable gem. <br /> Remember this people, most times, popular are not equally good.
