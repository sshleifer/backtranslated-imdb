Of course, Soldier of a normal standard for film criticism is a really bad movie. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill, but then became obsolete after being better off by a bunch of really super soldiers on a dangly hoop ruck that looks like a gladiator competition without crash mats. <br /> <br /> Leaving on a junk plane, he is befriended by a community of naff space hippies who teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. Kurt doesn't speak much. Finally, the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back as they run away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is assembled. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new "Best Explosion" category, Soldier will not win any awards. But as ridiculous as it is, it is still an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since foreigners (the APC is special) and in 90 minutes it is not welcome. Please note that the brand below is only a guide. Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
