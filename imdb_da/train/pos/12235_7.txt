"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastic gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that all self-respecting camp-horror freaks simply have to see for themselves! The ideal way to describe this low budget 70's gem is as a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times dirty! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic mission, but turns out to be the bearer of a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?) Steve sticks out of the hospital and leaves a trace of sticky pus and falls off body parts backwards. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him quickly as the disease also sets Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The principle may sound quite silly, but this flick is hugely entertaining and has great makeup effects from Rick Baker. The melting guy's face looks like a rotting pizza, and his powerful breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that William Sachs' manuscript does not waste any time on boring scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The rejection begins right away and lasts until the last minute of the movie. Just enjoy this stupid horror gem and try to extinguish your brain activity as much as you can, because if you start thinking about the many stupid things in the script, you will miss out on all the fun fun!
