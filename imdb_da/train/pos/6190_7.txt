Fay Grim is the continuation of a story started ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I haven't seen the previous movie and I don't know if it's a good thing or not. I can only see the current movie on its own. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's film production is something that you either like or do not. His combination of action, drama, absurd and dry, ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of sharply written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the Melbourne International Film Festival audiences laughing out loud. For the first half of the film, it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. It's a humorous style that unfortunately lacks in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teenage competences that Hollywood pumps out as pancakes. In the second half of the film, humor begins to thin as film morphs into an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. Whether it was Hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas, it's not clear, but I think a little editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes from the movie would have preserved the movie's original momentum. <br /> <br /> The performance was generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screening time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played all good support roles. The film's visuals were nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The movie is well written and I enjoyed it immensely. If you like Hartley's previous work, you will probably like this.
