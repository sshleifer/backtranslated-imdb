I grew up seeing this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was on. I still remember the first episode called "The New House." It scared me out! I can almost still hear the statue, laughing grin. And the end, oh my God! The hearing spirit comes into the room of the child: Yikes! This was classic TV, and it was one of a kind series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the Internet: 2 Actually. My question to any reader: Has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both vendors claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketched and bad DVD of the episode "The New House" and a few other episodes that are slightly better. But if anyone knows if these are much clearer, it would be worthwhile to buy and share with my children. A great series, clever, scary and bold supernatural. Thanks in advance to all the fans who have low on some of this. In fact, I'd like to discuss it. Chris Walker
