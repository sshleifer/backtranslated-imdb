The short who starts this movie is the true recording of a guy named Gary, who apparently was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a little "different"; he is an imitator and runs an old chevy named farrah (after fawcett). Watch and watch the filmmaker get a letter from Gary sometime later, and he invites him to return to Beaver to get some pictures of the local talent contest he has made together, including Gary's amazing performace like Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The two shorts that follow are Gary's story, the same you just witnessed, only the first being portrayed by Sean Penn and the other by Crispin Glover entitled "The Orkly Kid." If you're in the mood to have fun with someone, it's definitely the movie to watch. I was doubled with laughter through most, especially Crispin's performance, which certainly could stand on its own. When it was over, I had to rewind movies to see the real Gary and all his shining idiots. Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked to see one of the "fictitious" shorts taking a jab on Gary's Barry Manilow imitation, where he was just as ridiculous.
