I am a fan of both actors / singers, especially Gackt, and when I first discover this movie and see the trailer, I just think this is a silly one. After a long wait I finally saw it, and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows history and doesn't want to mention it, instead of what my first applause goes into, generally Japanese movies have not been brilliant and act.Yet in MoonChild's all cast is simply wonderful and came into it, especially Gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes well, I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous, as for the HYDE section, his plays are good, but he deliberately remains in the background as actor, respectively, as his character does throughout the film. I didn't like any filmography especially light and some colors, but because of small budget it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewel in the movie is history. It has some cheesy moments, but it's ok for me, and the movie's friendship theme is really well-developed and touching sometimes, on the other hand, history points out a cruel world that no one guarantees life, and with some memorable death scenes, this theme reflects visuals . An interesting note aside, this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the vampire, also played by the most beautiful (not beautiful, beautiful) actors of American cinema, in fact Moon Child is somehow seen as a brother with Interwiew but original on its own. Only problem that MoonChild is, it's a little slow sometimes, I'm a Japanese movie fan, and I used to, but it doesn't change. MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all in all, this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes as for actors / singers duo I hope to watch their other movies in the future and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire action sci-fiction and romance 8.10
