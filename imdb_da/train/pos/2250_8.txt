This is a wonderful movie about the battle of Mormon and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are extremely powerful, and the message is one that we must all remember - God does not speak, but He communicates if we only listen. As I write this amid the horrors of New Orleans and the surrounding area because of Katrina, I was especially moved by the fact that the Mormons were to leave behind and continue after Joseph Smith was murdered. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. The struggle of the Mormon to cross the land, the cost of life, the hardships they suffered, were truly awe-inspiring and demonstrated their immense strength. As for the actual beliefs of Mormon, this has not come in much, and polygamy is mentioned, but is not a central feature of the film at all. <br /> <br /> The cast is front, though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about where the true portraits were. But as actors dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all do excellent with the script they got. <br /> <br /> Although the movie could have been easy on its own (and certainly does today), Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the cinemas to watch a movie about the Mormons. Power is beautifully beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains with the family after her father is killed. Power doesn't have much to do at the end of the movie, when he has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, even though they make a nice couple. Their fate is unclear for her conversion, and you wonder about the polygamy in their case. However, you can't beat anyone for the eye, though.
