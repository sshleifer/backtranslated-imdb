Simply amazing movies without a doubt about it. Fantastic history and amazing performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is shameless with Mallika and Co, this film is completely vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity depending on our Indian community. But the message and concept that this movie carries is absolutely fantastic. Anu Malik (dull copy) could have been avoided, and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given a little Gujarati touch especially in music too. Anu Malik is the worst musician around and he thinks himself pop star, but it is not the movie where there is a need for presence. He only looks good with Govinda style songs. I felt some fine serious music with some good Ghazals or sad songs that could have made this movie more memorable.
