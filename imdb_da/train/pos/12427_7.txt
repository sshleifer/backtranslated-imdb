This film has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it can stop to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography are surprisingly quite good, although some of the experiments just don't work. The biggest problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek boy; And the sad, simple fact is that he is unable to play anything other than Fox Mulder. He's moving, he's trying to be licking, he's posing, he's trying to be a macho. Eventually he just tries too hard. He survives his character, he overspeaks his lines, and he's just out of the game in every way by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, each of whom is in a class over him in terms of performance. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a spotty moment or two where he over-dramatized his role, but one could tell he had fun with it. He saw that part, and he became character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also really good. She didn't have a big role; In fact, even though she could have used a much stronger ... her character was hardly developed enough, even though she did remarkably well with what she had. And chemistry between her and Hutton was evident (gee, that's why Uma left him ...;) All in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort with a good throw and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not ripped off his role, it would have been * the * much better. 10.7.
