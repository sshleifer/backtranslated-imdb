The movie was pretty good, a good action plot with a lot of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did nothing, except to disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The film looked very much like the events of September 11 with a bin-like terrorist who sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to detonate it. Judson Mills had some amazing action roles, taking out Rashid's composition and various kick-butt roles, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took over most of the action and left Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But in general it was realistic and did not lack the action, but it only did so on Mr. Norris' part. I gave the movie 7/10.
