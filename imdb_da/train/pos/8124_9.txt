Apart from the big movie METROPOLIS, it's about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. While at times the movie is a little preaching and the play can be a bit wide, it is a great movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no movies I can think of, it's something like that. Second, special effects were mostly incredible - using dull paintings, models and huge casts to create stunning scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a great city tomorrow. Sure you could sit back and knock the movie, because today the standards are just uneven. But you have to understand that this was state of the art when the movie came out in 1936, and it must really have baffled the audience. In many ways, the sets look high on the "modern cities" mentioned in the 1939 WORLD'S FAIR. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is also interesting because it seems to be off the question "are people really so stupid or are we destined for greatness?" The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> A final note: I watched this on TV twice and recently on video. All three times the sound and print quality - especially the sound - succeeded. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it is much cleaner and will provide optional captions. As the sound of the video continued to cut out, I would really have appreciated this!
