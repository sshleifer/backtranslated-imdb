I first saw this absolutely naked documentary in the first release back in 2001, and it really had a profound impact on me, so much so that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repetitions. Bottom line: none of my friends went away disappointed (ever!). This star play is about the Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some beautifully beautiful works of art with natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that gradually return to their natural form (a statement in temporary state of all?). We'll see Goldsworthy create more works of temporary art as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world as well as a few in the natural world. German film producer Thomas Riedelsheimer is leading, photographing and editing this meditation on the creative process, which is a great experience for both eye and ear (with an ambient musical score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally edgy experimental / noise textured guitar, as well as a skilled ensemble of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a movie theater that highlights the revival of this fine movie, you should at least find it (it is easily a movie composed for the big screen with a good sound system to really experience this movie the right way). No MPAA rating but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on the screen is intended to offend or interfere)
