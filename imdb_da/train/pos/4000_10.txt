Wow. So last night, and I'm still on the way from how good it was. Each character felt so real (though most petty, selfish and ** holes) and the bizarre story - middle-aged widow shagging his daughter's feckless boyfriend - felt convincing. Top performances all around, but hats off to Anne Reid and our friends in Nordic Daniel Craig (the latter coming over as the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? This is so far from Notting Hill as it is possible to be. God God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
