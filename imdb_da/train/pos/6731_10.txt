I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * It provides insight into something I hardly understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it is a lifetime for these guys. * Buried in the movie is a great story of surfing; I've never surfed, but I love surfing movies and have seen many. No one taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flows well. The interviews were excellent * It's interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> In summary, it's about as good as a documentary I've seen, so I have to evaluate it. So 10/10
