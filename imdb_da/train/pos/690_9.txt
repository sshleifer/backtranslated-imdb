I didn't know what this movie was about or even knew it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon when I searched for other movies staring at Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this movie was a strange insight into the thought of a no-sleeping and what his / her mind can go through in the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is sleeping, it was an interesting movie and a good deal was played by Dom ....... I think that even though this movie you can't buy anywhere (I've never seen it anywhere), you should see it if you ever get the chance because It really will make you think of the people around us who can't sleep and have to suffer the night after night couldn't sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep each night so generally it was an interesting movie of good substance.
