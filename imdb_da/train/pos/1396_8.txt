Probably one of the leading examples of following an exciting dramatic episode (in this case, the amazing Terror Balance) with a lighter affair, Shore Leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the Star Trek authors to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi and while the formula is not quite right yet in this post (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in season 2), the fires come quite quickly as long as the viewer is willing to allow all the misery. <br /> <br /> Based on the show's tradition, Enterprise is not in any proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew member to spend leisure time: a well-deserved break after three months of uninterrupted work. The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, others begin to experience similar things: A woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has an inlet with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the form of almost love and the guy who used to choose him at the academy. Throw a freakish real tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to find out what's going on before someone gets hurt. The idea is a classic: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. The episode's humorous takeover of the subject is quite successful, it wasn't for a dark event that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works fine again) and the cast's general reluctance to show a more fun side of himself (especially and ironically the otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave has earned the recognition of being a good example of the authors trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
