Putting the camera on me is a deceptively sweet movie. It is actually a complex glimpse of children's psychology and provides interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface, this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80s by a group of top-class neighborhood children. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic director of all the films. Sure, it's just some cute kids having fun. But it is also much more. This is a glimpse into some moments as children intervene with a number of confusing issues that we all face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, effortless love, loneliness, and just trying to make sense of the adult world as seems to explode around us. As we age, we tend to forget how survivors were in life when we were young. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie more valid is to see a young Darren Stein become a small general for a movie maker. Clearly, Darren is running this show, and these little movies are his vision, but they are all informed by their friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics, and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard of or seen children make "small" films about holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war, and inability to fit in and make friends. These kids confront and deal with some heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is the way Stein and Shell draw different scenes together so closely with ongoing interviews with the children --- all now adults and all friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us have kept in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they had to deal with still run between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a confession of an infatuation reveals a still broken heart, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" issue between two of the men, some ongoing anger over the dynamics of relationships, and there is still a member of this team who is still very responsible and at the center! It makes perfect sense as you look forward to these home videos in a couple of years. Darren Stein is the director. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> From time to time, Stein and Shell are chatting to each other, and you can't help but imagine being awkward about letting us look into these people's young lives. This is especially true for Stein, who has been a great success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, author and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see aspects of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" --- and this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie where a Jewish concentration camp victim is being tortured and killed by a Nazi. We discover through interviews and stories that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim played by a gentile child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that glides into the darker side of fear and the way children work through the horror of the adult world, which is beyond adult understanding, much less than a child's. <br /> <br /> These are much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff --- and worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
