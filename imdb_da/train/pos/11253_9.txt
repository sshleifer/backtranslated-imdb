This is an extremely long movie, which means that you can become very boring before it becomes interesting, but the length allows for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the blame of the abominable, you will find it particularly heartbreaking, for it is a story that finds its heroes among the wicked and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and cast since childhood by the same people. <br /> <There is not a really sympathetic character throughout history, not a loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize with. But seeing it all without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it in the end. It's worth it for people who like inciteful movies about bases human character.
