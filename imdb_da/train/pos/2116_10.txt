Has there ever been a movie more charming than this? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the actor group really seems to interact and influence each other's life. In the middle is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and cannot come together face to face, but who completely connect each other anonymously as penpals. But there are also supporters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the latest "Shop" update), they're not just whipping up to support the two leads and their needs. Everyone becomes an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapetry of charm. One of the most cordial scenes in film history takes place when the near-tragic Frank Morgan resigns and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with. A must see! **** out of ****
