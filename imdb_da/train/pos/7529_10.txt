Two years have passed and most of the time they all look different, some for good and some for worse. I still enjoyed as much as I did the original. <br /> <br /> Some errors they had as a change to the joker, he now has no red lips and looks more like black-haired hair and black students who are still pronounced by Mark Hamill who is a plus I guess. They made Poison Ivy more white hint that she became more like a plant, and the Catwomen looked very different and not as "attractive" as she was in the original. Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and scarecrow look bad, especially scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work as alone as he used to. Most of the time works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman gave the yellow logo and with the black wing of his costume and seems like he grew a little bigger but still kicks tons of donkeys. <br /> <br /> The view is not as good as the original, mainly because of some of the renewed characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever, and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" may be one of the greatest Batman episodes ever so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
