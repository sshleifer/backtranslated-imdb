I recently watched this movie. 2 hours later, my head was still grinning. The reason was so horrible, the jokes were so bad, but what I didn't expect was: <br /> <br /> 1. The 2 scenes before and after the movie that had Pat and Jay bag (it caused more than enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. The tip through the windscreen that decapitates the evil one. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with an ad that said you didn't like the movie, send a certificate to HBO. While I was thinking about it, the date you could send it was in January 1991 (which also meant that there was some confusion).
