Throughout my 60's I have learned that when we see a movie, an identification (whether we want it or not) is implicit with a particular character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character performs a particular gesture, sometimes because the character speaks crucial words or sentences ?? which we use or we would like to use ?? in a particular situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be seen from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space ?? in a shopping mall, in the center or on the street - taken by a car whose driver cannot remember thinking that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who doesn't want "Rub out" the bad spit? "The Haven said I was asking: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES! so try not to find absurd details relatively to the reality of life in the movie, because you will surely find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstractions made, you will see that the movie has surprising moments which : 1- In the order in which Della grabs the box of utensils in the trunk (does it contain a gun and does she have the courage to use it?); 2- In the order in which Terry dies while falling 3- In the order in which Della is attracted to Chuckie's "Mermaid's Call". <br /> <br /> If you've already seen the movie or if you're planning to watch, remember that there are "realistic" movies "fiction" movies, "political" movies and movies where you can "wash your soul"? To exemplify the latter, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite." is unanimously applauded as BOPE officials took certain positions. (As I've seen the movie in DVD, I couldn't find the audience's reaction). <br /> <br /> Concerning the direction (Susan Monford), interpreted (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition (William M. Anderson 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card' Extraordinary Edition , 'Robocop 2' etc. It is well in context, on a scale from 1 (Terrible) to 10 Piece), I rate "When She Was Out" a 7 (Regular).
