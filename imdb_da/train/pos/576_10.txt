this movie was just brilliant, casting, setting scenery, history, direction, everyone really fits the part they played and you can just imagine being there, Robert Redford is a great actor and now the same becomes director, came Norman's father the same Scottish island as myself, so I loved the fact that there was a real connection with this movie, the witty remarks throughout the movie were great, it was just brilliant so much that I bought the movie as soon as it was released to retail and would recommend it to everyone to see and the fly fishing was great, really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry on a movie it must have been good and it was quite Congratulations also to the two little boys who played part of Norman and Paul, they were just brilliant, children were often abandoned by the promising list I believe because the stars playing them all adults are so big profile for the whole movie, though These kids are amazing and should be praised for what they have done, don't you think? the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone else's life, which after all was shared with us all.
