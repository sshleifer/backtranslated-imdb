<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It's a throwback to glitxy, the romantic romantic comedies of the 1940s. But with a modern touch.The manuscript bursts with game, charm, humor and soreness, cinematograpy is breathtaking (NYC has never looked so beautiful), and of course it's thrown! Dudley Moore, in her career as Loveable, drunken Arthur Bach. He is also wistful and real .. one of the film's best lines is his poignant "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a very deserved Oscar for his amazing achievements as Hobson, Arthur's valet and caretaker. Though he regarded it as a "take the money and run the role," he brings the character of all the talent, experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a blurry comedian. The support model is also out of this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's sassy Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso. The result is also extremely memorable and complements the film perfectly. The only real problem with the movie is the poorly pursued successor it created.
