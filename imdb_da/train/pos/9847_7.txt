Have fun watching this movie. Despite the feeling, I got much of the time that this movie almost copied Monsters Inc. There are a few things that are very similar to the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break the relationship, etc. It felt so good in the whole movie, for me. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming features, however, is Scrat :) Very very funny character, though he doesn't serve any purpose :)
