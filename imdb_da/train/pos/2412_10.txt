I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and listed "Drama" series to come on any network for a long time. This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a great Primetime Soap. People look forward to this type of play as we become "Reality TV" overkilled. I long for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I expected it to get better. There is so much to expand with these characters, and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right. It would be a loss not to explore this and develop these signs after pulling and retrieving us into their world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without going overboard or offending. Loved it.
