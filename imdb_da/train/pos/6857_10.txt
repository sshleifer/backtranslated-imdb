"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. Its dealings with sex and violence make this a movie for adults. Brian De Palma shows once again why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He leads many scenes without dialogue, and he tells a lot about his story, strictly through the use of his pictures and Pino Donnagio's brilliant score. Filmed in Panavision, the film is to be seen in widescreen as De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, on video, "Dressed To Kill" is hardly the same movie. Massive performances from its cast, amazing direction, and perhaps the finest movie score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.
