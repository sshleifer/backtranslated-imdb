I want to know all the fans of this documentary that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so proud of him. This mini-series, as shown on VH1, has a good look at drug culture over the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it. The amount of time and effort I've seen him in this documentary and the book that started everything (can't find my way home) makes it much better to watch him on television. I know he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in interviews that he did himself and the amazing additions he himself adds to the comment. From the music to the videos and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I appreciate comments on this from those who have had it (or not) and would like to hear from fans! Three bowl for Uncle Martin !!!
