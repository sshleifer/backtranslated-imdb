It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czech obsession with 'The Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is another great Czech movie. It's fun, dark and extremely comfortable. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never quite know what to do next and even keep it up to the second and third views. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has produced a fantastic amount of world-class films and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films from Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor by its nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm atmosphere behind it. This movie is just that, it's scary and deals with the less lovable sides of people, but underneath it is a beautiful story full of promise, good intent, and optimism. I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in. Enjoy it, it's a movie made of that very reason - yet it is as close as the Czechs are ever going to write a really happy ending ...
