Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be happy. That woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. Finding one day is a tough combination. And Jeremy Northam. I heard his name many times, but I never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is: "Use him more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I saw it in one of my cemetery changes. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a little too complicated and mysterious for that. I still can't believe I didn't see the ending coming. I don't want to say what reason will ruin the hollow film. Although it says it's spoiled enough. <br /> <br /> Now I have to vote for this movie. I love the dark mysterious story, the actors did a good job and I love the past (natal) work before. There is not a large audience for this kind of thing, it is also quite risky. You know what, I just need to give this work an 8 reason that everyone should see this. Then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always room for improvement.
