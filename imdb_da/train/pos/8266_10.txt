This is the finest achievement of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's social realism period, based on a tragedy in early 1906, which claimed the lives of nearly 1,100 French miners as a coal dust blast deep in mines in Courrieres in the North of France took place after a fire had smeared for three. Weeks, ultimately release deadly pit gas that caused the deaths. Estimated designer Erno Metzner creates sharp sets that simulate the tragedy, give an experience of reality, enhanced by harmonic sound editing. The only music is produced by integrated orchestras at the beginning and ends parts of a work for which sound effects are equally important with the prominent director's fascinating visual compositions. Pabst's way of "invisible editing", which highlights action from shot to shot through the movement of players, turns out to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film, which also highlights sublime filmography with vehicle-mounted cameras, enabling the director to Move in the middle of scenes without having the necessity of cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the work relates to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is kept in its details, born of Pabst's nonpareil skill by weaving several plot lines into a cinema tapestry that touches one admiration of German rescue groups where their homeland is very proud, but no less desperate, of catastrophic losses for the families of the French; Certainly, a seminal triumph fully stimulated today to a cynest as it was at the time of its first release.
