I've seen this movie, and although I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked to see it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes a lot on life's film network. And I think, as it's close to Halloween, they might play it more. So be aware of it if you are interested in seeing it. I think Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like her as an actress and person. She seems so beautiful and down to earth. Kevin Dillon's performance was so for me. I'm not trying to beat him or anything, but I think his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better. Kevin just seems too sweet to me. But I think he did it okay.
