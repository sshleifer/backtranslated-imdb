Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few companions in the genre. Like other Anthony Mann images, The Far Country blends a potent pot of boiling history with a well-known knowledge of influential nature. Both are played out among some of Mann's peccadillos as honor, integrity, fraud and of course death! The story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} traveling to the Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. They are aware of the thriving gold boom they plan to make a tidy profit selling cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving at Skagway, the self-appointed judge finds Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet Webster because Webster has broken the law, all with honest cause along the way. For punishment, Gannon takes their partners crew from them, but they steal them back and head over the Canadian border to Dawson with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here, beautiful women and a gentle and lawless city will fill all the fate involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, long-distance James Stewart's bubbling {anti} wholly benefits pending depiction and Mann's smooth direction of the tight Borden Chase script. The movie from William H. Daniels is superlative, it has not made any favors of the current DVD prints, and the movie has some surprises, and one "doesn't he?" The core reeling viewers in. Paying dividends on re-watches for hardening genre fans, it is still some of an important show for first-hour venturing into the wonderful but dark, western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8.10
