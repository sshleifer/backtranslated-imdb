"Read my lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" (which probably has another idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a nifty, twisty modern narrative of office politics, which unexpectedly becomes a crime captain, as the exceptionally customized characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual smooth slope. The two leads are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (which I have never seen before despite her long resume in French movies) and an even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who has brought a sexy and / or threatening look and vote to some American movie). <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is on her grass at a competitive real estate agency and he is the neophyte. The second half is on its turf as an ex-con and her scary adaptation to that environment. <br /> <br /> Author / director Jacques Audiard uses very wisely the woman's insulating hearing impairment as an entrance for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down to hear what she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when the audience speaks) and also uses visuals as sensory reactors. None of the signs seem as expected (she is not as the agile victim of "In the Men's Company", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall bow of the unpredictable storyline (well until last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic discotheque for romantic and criminal stakes. <br /> <br /> There is a side story that is thematically redundant and unnecessary, but it just gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites this year! <br /> <br /> (originally written 7/28/2002)
