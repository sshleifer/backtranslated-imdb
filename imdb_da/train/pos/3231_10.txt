Soldier is not a good movie, and anyone who hated it has lots of good reasons. But I liked Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. First, the art direction is tight and well done. As far as science fiction backgrounds were concerned, Soldier did things with more design then the 90% genre. The sets, costumes and props were all coherent and competent; I didn't all love their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this movie made it worth the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of my youth's most memorable movies ... Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter movie. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an important action hero. It is not an award-winning role, but Kurt measures convincing emotions with very little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, battle scenes and battles are well choreographed. This is not an iron or even matrix, but it far exceeds the average quality level of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it and you like sci-fi action movies, pick it up if you pass on your rental depot of choice. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner.
