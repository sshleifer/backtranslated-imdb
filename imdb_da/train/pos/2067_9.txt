While it is universally recognized that terrible symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode, they have been, they are they will be, whether it makes it a rip-off or a tribute is a more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I subscribe to the latter belief, although the less-favored may not. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of managing such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it off in style, teaser is an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a good job of making a credible sign out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader looks at threat like Ed Meecham. Forget about the dubious originality of symmetry and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X file.
