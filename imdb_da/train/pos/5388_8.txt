I watched this movie yesterday at Turner, and I couldn't stop watching until it was over, even though I could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in his role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of it seemed to stretch the boundaries, but all in all I loved it !! If you get the chance to see it, do it! I actually cried on a few scenes, but then I guess you are a mother you wanted. Loretta is beautiful and I was just amazed at the very idea of ​​being unwanted mothers there, it seemed before her time. I say, see if you can and don't listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
