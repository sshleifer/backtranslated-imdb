quotes by Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Fine movies but DVD" reformatted to TV ", April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and emotional movie. On the other hand, the DVD I purchased has been "reformatted to fit your TV" by the bricks on Columbia Tristar, there is no excuse not to give the movie in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all movies as the one-time moronic waste it is so used to producing. > <br /> What a (criminal!) shame actually, but there is another version though, look here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Fantastic performances by the two main players (The King and Doggie) BTW.
