Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who is presented fully and very credibly, despite being so rude as the limit of indecency. She will do everything possible to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus, under the outer exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. The movie suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending, which subsequently feels completely inadequate and it is convenient to finish your school creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up'. It's also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but don't let any of it put you off.
