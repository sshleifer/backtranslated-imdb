I originally saw this movie years ago in Cinemax Friday after dark series (back when the cabinet was built as a keyboard) and it fascinated me. Although there is a pointless aspect to the movie, it is well-acted. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very fun. They have a good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes a pink coat look breathtaking. A movie like this would probably not be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the United States), as it seems to be sensationalizing things like violence, robbery and casual sex. This film shows that with a talented cast & also talented instruction a good movie is a good movie regardless of the subject. It made me find out that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future I will check him out with Depardieu & Miou -You come into your hankerchief.
