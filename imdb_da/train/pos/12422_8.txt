With the mixed reviews I was not expecting too much and were pleasantly surprised. It is a very entertaining little crime film with interesting characters, excellent portraits, writing that is soft without being glib and a good pace. It also looks good, in a funky way. Apparently people can either like this movie or just hate it, and I'm one who liked it.
