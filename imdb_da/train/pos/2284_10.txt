This is a very chilling and mostly thoughtful drama. I am very impressed with the movie, not just for the plot and great plays, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies that involve a spy or a war are filled with a smooth spoken Brit or a strong blow, but not this. It is not about this kind of war, it is about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, which is a supporter of an evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must remain a state secret. Returning to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters, providing interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte more than pulls out of the role and fits perfectly with what it asks.
