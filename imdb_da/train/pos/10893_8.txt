That's a good thing I rented the movie before I see the viewer rating from this site. It was a wonderful movie that I would add to my Christmas market. The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role. I want to tell viewers who haven't seen the movie go ahead and buy it. I judge it right up there with Christmas holidays. The movie was very fun and well written, and Ben plays the eccentric rich leader very well. The things he says and does is just how I could imagine someone with too much money to act. The film is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas with the cranks. Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas that you can't buy love with money.
