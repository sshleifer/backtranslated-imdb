Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who got it right. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie of "Hamlet" containing the full four-hour William Shakespeare's masterpiece and giving a unique feel to the whole story. Not many directors could pull this out without boring their audience, but Branagh's talented use of bravora film stunt and stunt cast allows people to see the significance of the scenes that are usually cut out. <br /> <br /> Examples of this are Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose entire purpose in the movie was to just say "yes my master" as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave engraver, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. Branagh's practice of law 4 scene 4 soliloquy (which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic wonder as the camera slowly retracts as the intensity grows. It's a scene that literally made me jump out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only film producer who understood the importance of each scene in this movie and knew how to convey that importance to the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for anyone who enjoys his good storytelling, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All those parts of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
