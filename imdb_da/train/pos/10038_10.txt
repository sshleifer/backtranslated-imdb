Titanic must be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (which movies do not) but it is fun. <br /> <br /> When I stumble over someone asking me why I like the Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, don't you?" I know so many people who don't like this movie and I'm not saying I can't see why. "The love story is too cheesy" Well, but isn't it fun and moving? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, not everyone enjoys seeing a beautiful story that lets us slip a little in imagination for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet, are horrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie I agree that they do not fulfill their full potential. But I find it unfair to say that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think they are both very talented actors who, unfortunately, are very famous for a movie they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem right enough that you can take great care of them but I agree with many people that they did not, as it might have been expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if you come to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies, then I'm sorry, but why on The earth they went and watch a movie that is clearly all these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Just because you're a movie, not because you don't like the genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Well deserved of their Oscars, especially Best Cinematography, which I think is the best I have ever seen in a movie, perhaps saving the ringing trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know some of the writing fails like the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The feedback part of the story can be quite weak at times, but in general it is a great achievement as the Titanic look is so real and the sinking feeling is so epic. I understand why many do not like this movie, but for the most part it boils down to those who do not think about the basic idea as if it is a love story, rather than those who think of the movie and in themselves is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books on the Titanic, including memoirs the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate, saving only a few errors. The only thing I can find is that the pipes must be coupled, not steel, and the iceberg looks rather unrealistic, just as it is the scene where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies but simply because it is an excellent cinematic achievement that leaves a feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.
