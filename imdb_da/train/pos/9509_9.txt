Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The movie is about Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks with perfection, a kind of hitman / killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He dislikes this job, but does so because Rooney paid for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are unaware that this is his job, and when witnessing a cold blood murder by him, he is in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a good job as always and Jude Law plays his sinister role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and much shows how the 1930s were.
