It's a little disturbing to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig got his name and also a good career strength after playing small parts under a different name. <br /> <br /> I oppose most other comments and say I really enjoyed this movie, mainly because of Barbara Stanwyk's lively show like Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring, and fake as the eldest of three daughters whose mother died on Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during Woar War I. <br /> <br /> As "man" of the house, Fiona has been stuck for many years to end her father's will, which would allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get the family home. But Fiona keeps a secret of why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle flirtatious sister who is married to an Englishman but requires her youngest sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwyck fan, it's not a miss.
