An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began when the first ended, with much mystery. Suspense in most, if not all, episodes and mysteries everywhere. Someone who made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the author can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all those elements to make the character's life in the show so meaningful. Never fail to tension, and I look forward to the new season. Hopefully, more secrets will be revealed and at the same time more mystery will be solved. Good selection of cast for this show, perfectly suited to the characters. Really can't wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully, all the hype will not ruin the end.
