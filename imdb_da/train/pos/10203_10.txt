I love the movies and own the cartoons, the comics are different from the movie, but still I will give it: 10 out of 10. It was great. If the movies were more awesome. I wanted her babies. And I'm a woman. Read the comics, you won't regret it. Yes in this movie since Brian P., the artist for her died, we do not get nearly as good artistic work. I mean seriously, don't make me wrong, these people did big but different versions for different people. Different lines for different people as it says says. Any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane, or doesn't like women, or you just know how to plan crazy. If I could count on my fingers, how in love and how many times I read the comics, I would probably run out of fingers, but there are always toes.
