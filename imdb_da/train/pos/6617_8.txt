Animation always seems to be fringe. In Japan this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more so in the United States, the animation has a big fat "KIDS" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries that are classics like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you've never read them, it's not too late. There is no upper age limit on them and they do not carry the nerd stigma in DC or Marvel) It seems natural, a movie like this pops up in France. It fits my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving, anti-US-oriented and talented film-makers. Fortunately, there is also "A scanner dark" out there to suppress this view - art seems to be largely international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have gathered, the Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person, you will be afraid of this. However, there is no need for it! Underneath it's cool, slimmed-down cell-shaded look, there's a good thriller and a good movie together. <br /> <br /> It was one of my fears about this movie. It's so easy to make the spectacular animation a gimmick, as does Sony & C: o with their Pixar rip-offs. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very engaging movie, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it anyway for neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worth the same level. NOTE: I've seen the French dub, which was OK as far as I could see. English can be more interesting what about Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> One last word of praise for the animation. It was great. Forward-looking, well-crafted, beautiful camera work, smart solutions (eyes look very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning, I felt like jumping out "This is so amazingly impressive!". So again, I really like animation and I appreciate the effort the studio put down so my judgment is a little biased. <br /> <br /> Still, good movie surely lives beyond the "gimmick".
