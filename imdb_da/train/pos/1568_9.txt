Catscratch is the best thing to get out of the Nickelode, including Wayne Knight. This show does not just appeal to Maoris and PI's. some people love it and they are all aussies. At first glance, I admit that it seems a bit raw, but it grows enormously on you. Also, to fix something that one of the other critics has said In_Correct (Tv.com) doesn't say "does that mean you're gay now?" he says "does that mean you are gay, owww?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr. Looks, I think, the funniest of all like Peww-Weww's Playhouse <br /> <br /> First, I will admit that the early episode was a little good. But after a while the episodes became good! And just as the series had found it surreal, whacky ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know Nick is meant for kids, but every moment a brilliant show is shown to be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. These shows include Mr. Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All of these must have been considered good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like the famous last episode where Gordon strikes a duck. <Br /> <br /> I'd also like to see a DVD, with lots of audio commentaries and behind-the-scenes docos, including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course what I am I will definitely see the show coming back into the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all gag closing credits. It would be nice.
