Like the characters in this show, I was also a teenager in the 70's. The producers really nailed the entire zeitgeist, being a suburban teenager in the 70's. The 70s fashion, cars, interior decoration, food and fads are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, all of which are well connected with the camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic style movie sequences. No other show makes the camera tricks like this. These advanced movie sequences really help convey campy hipness, which characterized the 70's era. All in all, this is a very fun sitcom. The only thing that worries me about this show is that it is over-reliance on cruel humor to generate laughs. In this way, I think this show is trying to be too much like married to children. While married to children is a good sitcom in itself, it is sticky that the creators of the 70s show trying to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend showing the 70's, mainly because of it's nostalgia factor. However, it could be an even better show if the authors were more witty, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.
