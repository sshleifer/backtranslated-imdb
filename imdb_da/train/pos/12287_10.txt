Although history is fictitious, it draws from reality not only the history of Latin American countries, but the entire third world. This is the true, pure and red recent history of these countries summarized briefly in this novel / film. The offbeat supranatural things, ease the intensity of historical events presented in this movie. After all the supernatural things are part of the culture of the Third World. Though not critically acknowledged (probably because of the supernatural things), this is an excellent movie with a great story and great play.
