If you've seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and must admit that we (PR) live a real chaos right now, drugs are the main cause of shootings and killings we have almost every day. These people shoot anyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We feel no more secure, and in addition, our so-called "justice" is no longer moved by truth and justice, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, deplorable facts and really portrays Puerto Rico's three main problems: the drug-related killings, money and power that manipulate our courtroom and innocent people and children are destroyed and even dying because of this. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their true-to-life plot and their award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country living one nightmare doesn't seem to end !!! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director of the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
