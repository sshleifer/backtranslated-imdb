Man, this is a hard DVD that comes by. I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Worth it? So yes. Not so much because it is a filmmaking masterpiece, even though it is directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read "Robert" but the DVD list Curt) or because it has a few known characters from other murder mysteries - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my decade of curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied. Essentially, a respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) has stood up by his foreign wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat lies on the stool beside his, and he politely invites him to participate in the musical review. She accepts, a little bleak. The Mopey bartender gives them both eyes when they leave. <br /> <br /> On the show, the stormy star discovers that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and breaks out with anger. Drummer in the band, Cook, teaches at the quiet lady, but gets no answer. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name, but she won't give it and she won't know him. If she had been a Longfellow devotee, she had said something about ships passing by at night. Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife murdered in his absence. The chief police, Gomez, turns him to DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady who no one else seems to remember - not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab ("Al Alp"), not the drummer - and since the lady herself has disappeared, it is impossible to dig her up. <br /> <br /> Curtis is doomed and doomed to die. But inspector Gomez has thought about things and decided that she is probably innocent because no one with a brain would make such a stupid story. He joins Curti's loving secretary, Ella Raines, to re-examine the case informally. <br /> <br /> They visit the supposed witnesses again. The vicious bartender runs over of a car, maybe by accident, so he is out of the picture. The heat-hardened Latina has left because the show is closed and she is uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real killer, but not before he is admitted to a scene where he pounds the drums into an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face is based on an expression that does not indicate intense focus, but rather a monstrous orgasmic madman. His eyes roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering frenzy. I laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> No one has performance, it's otherwise great, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. However, best performance is probably by Franchot Tone. He is the real killer, and he matures his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even when he fades, he is decorative. I don't know how to put this exactly, but Tone seems to be thinking as well as just acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is almost zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to a B image. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it's considered classic. It's really your basic murder mystery of Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man runs over and his hat winds up in a trough with water running around it. His use of shadows is clearly effective. <br /> <br /> Glad I got it.
