This 370-minute movie was broadcast by the Italian public television in the early 70s. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer by Odysseus' travel home after the Troy war. It is an epic story of the ancient Myoic and Mycenaean civilizations that were told on the list 500 years after these events to about 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy The DVD version would find that the sound is mono and there is no language other than Italian, even the close caption is in Italian. Pity. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had the English subtitles list. But if this is not a problem for you than I would highly recommend watching this movie.
