Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan write love letters to each other without knowing who the other is. Of course, they work together and cannot stand each other. You can guess the rest. It is beautifully traded by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks amazing. It's happening in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I thought I saw Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreamlike. One of a kind movie. Do not miss it!
