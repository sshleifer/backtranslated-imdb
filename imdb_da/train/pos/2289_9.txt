I'm a pretty pedestrian, with a little low taste. However, I occasionally try to raise the line of my cultural consciousness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe of the whole movie. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I saw it as a big question to the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept, be asked to accept, should accept? Of course, as a military member, this is an important issue for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
