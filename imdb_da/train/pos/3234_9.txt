I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very happy with it and couldn't really ask for more. I actually own the movie because I didn't return it to anyone ... As I was supposed to, but I really want to keep it because of how much I enjoyed it. Also the fact that I do not own too many foreign films and this is a first. Now I personally love Finnish stuff, so it's certainly added how much I enjoyed it. But generally it is worth seeing. But if you are not on the whole, trying to understand Finnish or reading subtitles bit, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
