Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the second week, when it is called "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I had the opportunity for subtitles and I think that SBS has given their own to what was, as usual, of very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just looking up "Laputa" on Wikipedia, it confirms what I assumed ... the floating island of this story is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's travels" published in early to mid-1700s. <br /> <br /> Yet, it's an engaging Japanese adventure that has an English voice-cast. It is suitable for young children, I think, but it runs in just over two hours in length, so it may be too far for some, but not for an adult like me. The story relates to two children seeking to find a legendary floating island that has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and the spies looking for the island and are looking to catch the children (Sheeta, the girl, pronounced by Anna Paquin and Pazu, the boy, spoken by James Van Der Beek) to help them find it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are magnificent ... kind of photorealistic at times, especially the stone works lit with torch lights or the beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
