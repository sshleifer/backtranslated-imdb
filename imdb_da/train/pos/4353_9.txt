So lucky we were watching this amazing movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon arrival at the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal assessment of the film. Looking at the map, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can judge so great? Only about 5 for me." But then the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser, while watching the spectacular landscape in the movie's setting of New York state, begins to slowly bump the film into a category at a time. It was certainly good, but the actors' all-natural repo and an award-winning performance by a man who unfortunately is likely to be remembered for a raincoat wearing a detective instead of this movie, jumped the movie to the excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and toned heart melted like Grinch's and I ended up giving this a fantastic one. This picture is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or nudity, but a strong language.
