Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might at first glance understand. It's a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out. Cast is all fantastic. I wish they had never made a sequel to the successor. The first was by far the best and had to be completed as it did without having a successor. It was fun watching Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She didn't seem to be old (she's just as beautiful today without the hairdresser and the 70's). The scenes through the mask are one of the most horrific things ever!
