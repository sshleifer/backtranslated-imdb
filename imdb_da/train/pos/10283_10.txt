House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with amazing performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players, and it introduces Ricky Jay, short sharp extraordinary, prestigious guitarist and historian. Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a manuscript and gives the film (where reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> On the face of it, the House of Games is a compelling insight into the unknown world of cheating and kings, diametrically different from The Sting, which was only played for glamor and yuks. At this level, it succeeds admirably. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from compassionate professional competence to incredible strength and self-realization. The only movie I know that deals with the theme of the emergence of personal strength in a woman in a dignified manner is the underrated Private Benjamin. The thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, jumping among several themes and utilizing Goldie Hawn's fine performance to hunt for some light laughs. House of Games stick to its business. As Poe once said of a good story, it ruthlessly drives to its conclusion. There is another strain of movie-about-women, characterized by Thelma and Louise, a large budget commercial cash machine with despicable theme that women are doomed, whether they realize their inner strengths. What it takes. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really watch this movie in a movie theater. It should be natural for film festivals. Nominate it for a near you if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of the House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.
