I am very surprised that no reviewer has so far commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in Luzhin's fight as white against a named opponent immediately before the finals. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a chess expert, Luzhin shows winning the game with an illegal movement. Between the quick cuts away and back to the board, it is not hard to see that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his smoke on d1 is still attached by black smoke at c1 towards his king in the corner at. Thus, he is unable to play the alleged mating movement Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but he has shown to make it a rapturous applause from the audience.
