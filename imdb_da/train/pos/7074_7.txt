Terry Gilliam returned to the future (he had already done so in "Brazil") to tell this story of a virus that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> The script is crazy about some easy tricks on it but it's pretty entertaining and Gilliam proves he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are just good). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what happened to her?) Are just okay, but Brad Pitt is so annoying when he plays roles out of his hand, then he shows himself so forced, and He is not trustworthy at all. He just has to play beautifully successful young men. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
