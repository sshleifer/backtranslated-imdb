I assume that when "Beat Street" was a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose" because both films focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings. Breakdance scenes in "Beat Street" come just before the middle and at the end of the girl. And I loved them all. Almost all break-tricks were highlighted in break jam scenes: jackhammer, flares, head spins, suicide seated, crazy legs, mortal, forward flip, figure four --- almost everything. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has violence related to gang life in the hip hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the former. The only big battle scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the movie was shortened as "Ramo") was chased by a rival legend on the New York City subway ..... fighting each other on the third rail and both die by electrocution on the rail. Well, even though the hunting scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood that exploded from a gang of shots. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang stuff in the girl were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the girl because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gangsterism. Even the film's theme song, which closed the curtain to the girl, was not just a tribute to the hip hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I assume the female drummer in the pit orchestra, performed by actress Rae Dawn Chong, Sheila E., who made a como look.
