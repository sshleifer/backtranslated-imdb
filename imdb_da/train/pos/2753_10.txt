My all-time favorite movie! I've seen many movies, but one beats them all! Excellent play, wonderful story. You will, as a "normal" caring person, begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is himself and a very lovable person. And most important things: You will learn to respect and look different to people with Down syndrome.
