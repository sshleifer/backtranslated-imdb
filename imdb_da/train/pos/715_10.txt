All the people sitting here saying that this movie is weak link is, Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was okay, if not for the annoying harpsichordist. Rock and Roll High School was centered around Ramones. How anyone can see this and not get a kick out of Joey Ramone who eats bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in execution state is obviously a wet carpet square papa-o. Ms. Trogar, exploding white mice, hall patrols ... instant classics. Nevermind Riff Randell character. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Ramones then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to see a movie called Rock and Roll High School.
