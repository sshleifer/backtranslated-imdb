I chanced on this movie because I had a free non-new release from Blockbuster and needed to grab something fast as the store was ready to close in the evening. The clear white cover and title fascinated me. I am a (relatively) "old" lady, and my son is a young man of 30. I offer movies that are pure entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film student and has very specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate each other's movie choices, but we both looked and LOVED the movie NO! It was unlike any movie we had ever seen before. We are both cynical / critical personality types, and we usually jump to movies while we watch them - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this film had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the United States, it would have done really well.
