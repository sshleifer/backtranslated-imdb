"The Last Wave" is one of the films that is highly dependent on the mind. The title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory: There will be a last wave that dries everything out. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer employed to defend some aborigines accused of murder. Around this time there has been unusually large rainfall in Australia. While defending the aborigines, David learns the last wave of theory and begins to wonder if it is just mythology. <br /> <br /> The final order of the movie is a metaphor for the depth of one's mind. Peter Weir created a confusing but thought-provoking film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (as you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting supportive role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, see the "making of" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the movie's undertones, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlin's background.
