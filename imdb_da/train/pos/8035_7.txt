Sunday wouldn't be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here he plays a sniper in the jungle that goes after rebels and drug addicts. Life is a bitch, so he gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to help on mission. <br /> <br /> The movie is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stuck up Anaconda. He doesn't do much better here, but Berenger is worth the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it may be a little long - who will see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's good, exciting action when time is right.
