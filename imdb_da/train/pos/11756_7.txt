The film did not do well in the cashier's office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a snap preview. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie where former players moved. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever put on screen but fun. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with his role. <br /> <br /> Best line of the movie at first, by Robin's character Jack: "I was so SOB!" Cleaned up here not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> Was happy when it came to DVD a few years back in wide-format / letterbox format. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you don't have to be one to like this movie.
