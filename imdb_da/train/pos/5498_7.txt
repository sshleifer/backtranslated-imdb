This documentary has been broadcast on both RTE and BBC over the last few months. Having seen it twice now, I would recommend it to anyone interested in media and documentary filmmaking. Initially, this documentary was intended to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chaves. The Irish staff got rid of these intentions. What happens when they come to Venezuela is spectacular as they testify to the first hand that the trial is being overthrown by rebel conflicts (especially the oil problems in Venezuela) by Chavez and his government. What we audiences witness is how the media manipulate the situation and, in fact, back Chavez's overthrow by distorting events that arise as the coup raises. It is truly an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers. <br /> <br />
