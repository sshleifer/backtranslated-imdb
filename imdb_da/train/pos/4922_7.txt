I wonder which audience today was thinking when they first opened their eyes to Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Surely he looks like no other of the time, the shell-like face, flat nose and elongated body - even now he remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than his appearance out of the sniffing New Orleans slums that seem to celebrate as the plague Blackie loses on the city. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very skillfully fitted ?? morgue black humor, Widmark-Douglas interaction, the un-touristy places, fighting among officials ?? everyone is woven into a tight-realistic thriller with a threat as opposed to other times. Even Widmark's homely scenes, which put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the tent fail to be too disturbing. Director Kazan certainly demonstrates his ability to halve a study product (Fox), no matter how he may have noticed the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark makes a solid low-key job as a public health worker. But my money is the only and only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a harder practitioner who could peel higher or be pushed more than the violent autumn man (eg The Enforcer, 1950). The scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife (Liswood), is a gem of hectic entertainment as Mostel tries to pacify each as some amok pinball. Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the unstable Kazan named him.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just the professionals who add color. The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the police. The whole scene has an impromptu air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and formed a beautiful little scene on the spot. Also the colorful rental hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. And what about the flea-bitten coffee shops that have me driving to the nearest Dennys. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is still a well-functioning, nodding thriller with an apocalyptic air that strangles many of today's mega hits.
