The fourth of five western Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this involves a hard-bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster, who takes a cattle run from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle. He chops in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen), whom he has sent before to make preparations for the boat trip north. <br /> <br /> But first, he has to put up with outrageous tricks, cheating riverboat captains and the charm of the coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who thinks Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. Therefore, she hides him on the boat, while the captain is looking for him for the earlier (and proper) killing of a track. Jeff also has the accident running into bad judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon unlocks Jeff to disturb his public hanging by driving his cattle through the city. He fines Jeff, the ownership of his cattle, and Jeff just needs to eat crows for the time being. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to ride Ronda up to Dawson to supply supplies. But it's just a ruse, so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle back. Of course, judge Gannon finds out and is just behind, but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle, while Ben races the cattle across the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, who just happens to be Ronda who so quickly creates a new game house in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and starts panning for gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get into the gold deal up there and tells Jeff that he's getting a little sorry for Skagway and will try his luck in Klondike himself. It involves bringing some hired gunman with him and forcing to steal some of the other mines' claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while they are doing well, leaving Rube as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. They are just looking for a way back to find themselves disturbed by Gannon's men, because Ben made a mistake opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured, but it doesn't save Judge Gannon from his overdue fault. The final shootout at night on the muddy Dawson Street is pretty much the one. First Jeff kills two of Gannons best gunsmith (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). So when Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff Gannon kills as he hides under a wooden pavement. Revenge has spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another rip roaring western that is right up there with NAKED SPUR and MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of widescreen print TCM user is outside of me. You will finish missing half of the glorious Albert's cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written 50s westerns then this is an A-list keeper. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
