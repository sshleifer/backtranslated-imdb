The emotional effect of this movie challenges words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic everything rolled in for two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures in his acting ability, the full spectrum of it. There you can just see? I saw the pursuit of happiness and thought it must be a fluke for the magnificent, over-the-top actor, smith. His performances in both films depict a completely different dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, script selectivity, I'm not sure, but I see him differently now. Seven pounds is one of the movies that, in order to enjoy its essence, you must suspend your faith. Don't see it for the plot, look at the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, reconciliation, love and sacrifice.
