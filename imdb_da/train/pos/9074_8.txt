The show is really fun. Nice theme. Witnesses and a liners are really good. With a little extra tuning it can be a very popular show. But the only major negative point in this show is cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who in the hell threw Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. Technical Russell and Jeff are the protagonists of the show, which make viewers see the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, The Relations wiz ... with an experience of all the problems a couple faces in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - doing a terrible job As Jeff is not at all suited to the role. He is like a robot, literally there is no blow in his dial-up speech. <br /> <br /> Cast is really very important for viewers to like it. The bad play will definitely take the show down ...
