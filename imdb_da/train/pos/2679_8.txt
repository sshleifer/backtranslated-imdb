Delirious, near the plot-less mood piece and if it is more LSD inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made! After a startling SM opening (which in itself is not what it looks like) we move to soft focus and dream or imagination or remember ??. Lots of literary and cinematic references and in fact it is the French film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and fascinating film unfolds at a leisurely pace, but has a wealth within each fold. A rare movie that blows inside. Old Jess could make them when he tried. Also fine key performances, including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I haven't even mentioned the Lisbon places - ah!
