This movie cannot put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is all cozy and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that at that time seem to be the right thing, but in retrospect does not look as great as they once did. "A love spread" tells the story of a family, yes it includes religion, but history is really about a family, and that the family's ability to stay together, whatever is thrown on them. This movie is also based on true events that are not to say that this story, scene after scene, is true, but if you were to look at news articles from that period, you would see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful to the family. Both churches are guilty here, the Catholic Church forcing such a regulation on the family initially and not responding to the violence that followed it, and the Protestant Church to tell the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not a fight. In this case, both families must be turned off. I think the film does a good job of showing this battle in both the church and the family. It is by no means the form or form to lay down in the Catholic Church, just the opposite, it shows how an event can change the course of the religion's ideas and how a person can have an impact far more than just ones.
