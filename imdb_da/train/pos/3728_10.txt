Never heard of this movie, watched it on DVD. Big movie, perfect example of a movie that took each cast member to make it work. No one typically overhyped Hollywood movies with the same old overhyped actors. No current quote "A" list actor could have drawn any kind of performance in this movie. Brings back memories from my own post Vietnam war military experiences. It was concentrated on the people who were sent to battle. Who was portrayed by the characters who had fear and emotion, though some volunteers were on duty. They were also ordinary people, some were not cut off for military life, I remember a few in my experience - to put it mildly, they also could not adapt to military life - but I will never forget them - should have stayed in contact . I highly recommend it and think of those who serve today's day in Afghanistan. Basic training is a trip, note that the drill sergeants are not breakfasters and maybe they need "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
