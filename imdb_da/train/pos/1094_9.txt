This is one of the few comedies I can see again and again and still laughing loudly. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct pigs. There is also no here unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family using a colored girl. The lines are fun, and all the managers have never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how troubled the process is, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel you are. not alone!
