Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems this is the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in him. The play is sublime. Renying Zhou as Doggie was great - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a joy - very credible as the old ancient traditionist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, indicative without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only several movies like this were made, either in Hollywood or Hong Kong - a family-friendly, well-groomed, well-written, well-registered, near-perfect gem.
