I just watched this movie tonight, opening night. It was good!! I'm a big fan of sports movies and it was just up there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr Quaid, if you read this ... my sister in Austin lives where you live ... and she should buy you a drink once ... Well ... she stood up well ... but she didn't mean that !: C) [not that anyone will believe it ...]) No matter what a good movie. Anyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it! : C)
