A light hearted comedy, Nothing shows us a world that we sometimes want to escape to: A world of nothing. Anything you dislike, be it a stack of bills, a bad memory or even hunger may disappear as you wish. They approached this movie very well, and with an enjoyable lead role duo, there were only a few things I didn't like about nothing, and they weren't even part of the main movie. First, the Post-credits scene (and yes, there is one): Good for a chuckle, but what did they try to achieve with it? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we hear a random assortment of sounds and they scream. It is trying to create a successor in my opinion, and it wasn't really necessary, nor was it fun when the turtle searched the frame. <br /> <br /> The other, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD, and as others have already said, it promotes a horror movie that never came. Oh yeah, bad marketing I think. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your movie rental store, take a look at because Nothing is a good movie to watch. If you have a large screen, you may have shades.
