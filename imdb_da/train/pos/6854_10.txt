Intelligent, stylish and convincing thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is among his best movies! <br /> <br /> When troubled housewives are brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son goes with a prostitute to uncover the killer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill left a strong impression on the audience at the time and with good reason. De Palma creates a wonderful dramatic story that begins with an exciting set-up and builds on a terrific mystery full of strong excitement. The final and conclusion is especially 'nightmare'. It's a real edge of your shock shock. Even more impressive is De Palma's elegant direction, which gives this film not only tight tension but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic movie, but mostly in a strange way. Pino Donaggio also gives a nice musical score to the movie. <br /> <br /> Cast is another strong feature of this movie. Michael Cain makes a fantastic trip as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the fake housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also turns out to be a worthy supporter as an investigative son. Many criticize De Palma's movie for having Hitchcockian elements and this movie was no exception. But any resemblance between Hitchcock's works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as called this movie a "rip-off" will be degrading to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans. <br /> <br /> **** out of ****
