After 7 years of seeing the terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt quite numb. Next Gen and DS9 were bloody good things, and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. This opened with probably the best pilot for a Trek show. The crew was really good as was the choice of actors for the portions. Scott Bakula played a typical first-time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to already knowing what captains from before. The rest of the crew was really sympathetic in their roles and I think they came for a good first season. When the show was canceled too early, I was really disappointed. In a mirror we showed dark what the casting was capable of. Too bad a movie or TV movie was never considered. So much back history and founding of the federal state left telling, including the beginning of hostilities with Klingons ..........
