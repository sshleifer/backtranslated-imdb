I just read the main comment for this movie that is on the cover of the poll results and thrown down. <br /> <br /> Why is it that some people can't take a movie for what it should be. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a light heart, tongue in the cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and stuff for the adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. <br /> <br /> I grinned my nuts on this movie, I thought Carey had a great performance and the whole movie (if you looked at Christmas) really gives you a festive celebration <br /> <br /> So to all of you filmmakers stop trying to sound like movie students and knock any movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they should be entertainment !!
