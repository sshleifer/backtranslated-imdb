I am a Jane Eyre lover and a purist and this version contains almost all the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story with great wealth and cannot be properly delivered in a feature-length format so it needs a TV mini series. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best ever. There has been much discussion about how attractive he is and his age. In the book, Jane (narrator) describes him as "about 35" and not young, but not age at age. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he did this so it's about right. We also have only Jane's opinion on whether Rochester is beautiful. She has just met him, and he asks her exactly what she thinks. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can't imagine she said she believed him beautiful. The actor playing Rochester needs to show us the character of man, and this is fulfilled to perfection. I love the relationship between the two leads, which is crucial to this story and humor in their meetings. Other versions have blown it, but it gets it right. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (age 37) is in BBC1 and is very good so I will decide if it's my favorite when it's finished. <br /> <br /> Seeing this series again after viewing the 2006 version, I have decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronton's dialogue has been preserved, and this is crucial for history. Modernization just doesn't work - it's a Victorian story and has archaic poetic speech that fits the characters. This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is small and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is a great actor. There are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the manuscript contains all the important scenes, but leaves unnecessary details, making it the point and moving. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
