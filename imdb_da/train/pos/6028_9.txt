This is the film in Antonioni's mid-term, which most critics quickly lose, as a "mistaken" look at the 60s American youth culture / politics. For what it is worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed film like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion and empathy here than elsewhere. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations of and criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counterculture, and the entire anti-establishment, anti-war backlash that was so prominent. <br /> <br /> Even from a technical point of view, it is a remarkably crafted film; from the opening circuit sequence to the bizarre desert 'love-in', to the use of billboards, and right down to the jaw-dropping cathartic finale that used 17 camera setups (in its own way, as powerful as the climax of The Wild Bunch). Also Antonioni chose a hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. There is not much involved as this feels more like a docu-drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals as the main couple works quite effectively in that context. And the soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, its use is also impressive (I can't forget the start of the movie, mainly because of music selection - by Pink Floyd - who burns the visuals so well). <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, it is quite an achievement in the cinema, and I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for off-beat. Worth to find out, and one of the central films from the 60s that requires a DVD restoration / release.
