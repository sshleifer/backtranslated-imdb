I have "Things to come" on D.V.D. and it is very clear in relation to my VHS version. The sound is fair, but it can be difficult to understand at times. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. It gave details on why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little things I didn't see in the first place. As John Cabal plays with a toy plane at a Christmass party, as if it were a dive bomb that emits sea power by naming a battleship, "Dinosuar." Ships submerged with air energy, an unclear enemy sneak attack by plane. Welded airplanes. Strong rolls for the women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are several, watch the movie to enjoy them.
