Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only this year it was shot, but also now. It is an art film that is not obsolete even in the 21st century. The manager maintained a good narrative skill and made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the later French New Wave movie: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a cote", which is the same subject.
