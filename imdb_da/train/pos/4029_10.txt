I don't have words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a true portrayal of the partition days. The film was kept in scare me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of her life in this movie. She put her life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in her role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone other than these two who play the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes looked so natural on Urmila, and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi clam. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha like Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did amazing work. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to his eyes. The Climax is just a killer. I expected a tragic ending, but luckily the ending was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Don't miss out.
