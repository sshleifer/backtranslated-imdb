Excellent movie from Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by a number of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject, and effectively captures hopelessness and ugly atmosphere in the 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify every side of this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without being drawn into the problems. On the other hand, it is a loyalist gang who intends to multiply violence. Very interesting and thankfully entertaining. Don't expect a laugh. 7 out of 10
