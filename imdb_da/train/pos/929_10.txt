The pride father was the best new show to watch TV since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece from the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the center centers around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also features many memorable supporting characters, including Roger the surly orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the faux patriotic Snout Brothers and the Chutney elephant. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose way, making the most mundane activities entertaining. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialogue and controversial problems (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the program's brilliance. <br /> <br /> The blame for this show's failure lies with NBC. They chose to broadcast the episodes in a specific order (perhaps influenced by which guest stars they could promote) instead of the more logical production order. Several times the show was preempted for an extra half hour of such drunk as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes it wasn't enough)! It is really a bad omen for the future of television as art, if an original and bold show like this fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Fortunately, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get a bigger follow. 10.10
