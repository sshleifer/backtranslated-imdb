Richard Brooks' outstanding 1967 film by Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion to Philip Seymour Hoffman's 2005 Oscar CAPOTE performance. They play really well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find movies made 38 years apart that mesh as well. These two really improve each other. Although various actors play the role of the killings of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces mix well. Only the part of the author (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name than Capote. I would suggest seeing CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It gives a strong experience!
