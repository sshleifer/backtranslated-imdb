It is amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, # 1 fan of the punk rock group Ramones, in Rock 'n' Roll High School. Suns are so bubbly, you don't mind that she is of course too old to be in high school (the fact is smoothed by getting all the kids to see 24). The movie is a fast pace that does not copy; everything is blown to smithereens at the end and it is like it should be. Mary Woronov, an Indian kinky and fun presence as the Nazi-like principal, initially gets a big, one-of-a-kind bit where Frisbees flies dangerously close to her head (how many times have they spent on it or was it Fluke?) and Dey Young are very appealing as the sun's best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest connection, ironically, in this "High School" chain is Ramones. They can't shop, they're not fun, and their concert segment goes too long. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is treated as a fantasy and is a success; Other random songs are good, especially a rare Paul McCartney ballad heard almost at the beginning ("we met somewhere before?"). Fun! *** from ****
