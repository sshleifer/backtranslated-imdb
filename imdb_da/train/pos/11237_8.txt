Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-lasting internet-only fan film, all the way to the love of the series, and a must watch for Trek fans. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes it can tell that they are green. However, this does not detract from the overall experience. The CGI ships are amazing, as well as the space battle scenes ... On the negative side, in the previous episodes (and even occasionally in the recent ones) I could tell that some of the actors / actors are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again Don't take this away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek. The castrator and crew have really found something special here, and as a whole I highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
