OK, first a correction to the tag on this movie's main page. Abe Lincoln did not go with her sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The person is Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend to Lincoln in his New Salem days. Some say Ann was actually Lincoln's boyfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> Now there are fabrications and fictionalisations in this movie. Hollywood has always been dramatically licensed with something under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. The trial in the film, however, is based on a real event: accusation of the murder of William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely fictitious in this movie with many name changes, it will still have viewers riveted to the screen. This is Hollywood's golden age, with drama at its finest, and Henry Fonda may provide the best Lincoln played by anyone.
