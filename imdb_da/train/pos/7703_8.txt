I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, but the special effects, since the Krell attack was awesome for a movie made over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East I saw shades of Islam when JJ Adams suggested that Alta dress more modestly and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed of the props. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man
