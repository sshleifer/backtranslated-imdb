It is a very difficult movie to watch, especially as it is aimed at the inner core of all our lives. But in the end it is a very beautiful and in-depth film. Anyone who finds it cynical, I must say that they must greatly miss the point in the film's entire message. For those who actually see the movie, they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary, and the result is ultimately uplifting. Sure, it's very hard to see, a difficult topic and even brutal. But it is highly relevant to society and everyone. It shows the top of what the world cinema is doing at the moment (I don't want to limit this expression to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I would say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views and just let the movie work for you.
