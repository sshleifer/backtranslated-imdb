Before the regular comments, my greatest curiosity about this is not a love song, there is a driving time set on IMDb of 94 minutes, the DVD from Wellspring Media in the US runs 88 minutes. Any input on this is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two very hard-life friends take the road for an adventure. What they are closing in is just that by accidentally shooting a girl and the two flying on foot into the country. Instead of just a big chase, the movie is complicated by the bad and slightly childish spike behaving inappropriately and hugging its boom box as a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story exclusively based on the character Spike, but without a little frustration added to the story, the movie would have been too easy. You will see how the more stable character Heaton refers to Spike as "big man" as opposed to Spike's "kid out of control" attitude and behavior. Frankly, I was also exacerbated by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially the spray can sniff, but in a desperate situation, it seems to be some of his mentality choosing a temporary flight. But Heaton was there to keep things in control until things went well over his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I wondered why he would want to choose Spike from prison and continue a friendship because of Glenan's good performance. After all, there are many many reasons during their run, it would be a good idea for Heaton to just ditch Spike and try to save himself. I guess Heaton felt like a Spike's elderly brother, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things get too desperate. <br /> <br /> While some of the cinematography is actually artistic, it offers more flavor to history rather than just pictures of the men running through the desert. The beautiful landscapes, rain and large gray skies give a gloomy tone that enhances the feeling of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual, and the use of Public Image Ltd.'s song "This Is Not A Love Song" and as the movie's title is quite clever. All in all, it is understandable if you don't care about this is not a love song, as it is focused on two contrasting personalities flowing from another man determined to chase them down (played by a cool, quiet David Bradley). It's not great budget entertainment. For the rest of us enjoying something minimal and dramatic, it's time to spend, and it gives you some extremely exciting moments that keep you breathing. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the movies coming out of Scotland recently, with similar ones, dog soldiers and the devil's tattoo. I'm also a bit grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, as the accents are sometimes light-hearted and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tense, THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is very tragic yet exciting storytelling. <br /> <br />
