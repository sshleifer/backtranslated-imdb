This movie is horrible - in a 'so bad, it's good' kind. <br /> <br /> The story is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that I will not even bother to describe it. It is a sword / turkish image, has a child's hope to realize how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide / wizard, a princess, a hair creature .... you get points . br /> <br /> The first time I caught this movie was during a very hard winter. I don't know why I decided to continue watching it for another five minutes before turning the channel, but when I got to grips with Gulfax, I decided to stay and see it at the end. is a white, furry creature that looks like Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or entertaining to see. He looks like someone was gluing a bunch of white sheath rugs together and forcing the actor to wear it. There are scenes where it seems that the actor cannot move inside or that he almost falls. Although he is not so much in the movie, the few scenes are worth it! See when he tries to talk to Bo Svenson, then the Solo-Chewbacca comparison is an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw the sequel, or even sought it, was because of his absence! Maybe there should be a final movie that completes the trilogy, Gulfax will make an expectation return!
