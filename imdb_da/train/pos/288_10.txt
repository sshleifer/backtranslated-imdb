This movie was so great! I am a teenager and my friends and I all love the series, so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all ages. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "rosy cheeks" when talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They mate so well together and have such good chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are so attractive people and are very good actors. I've finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately, it has been difficult for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheesy.
