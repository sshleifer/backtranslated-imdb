Jeopardy has the feeling of being a stock film of varieties - one of the films that studios pumped out between large budget / cash registers. It's only 70 minutes and doesn't have many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Once again, Stanwyck is a fierce lady as she walks into a runaway judge as she seeks help for her captured man in the Mexican desert. The bulk of the film is focused on how she deals with her captor, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological battles there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it tight and that Stanwyck is great, should go without mention (but I'll still praise her every time).
