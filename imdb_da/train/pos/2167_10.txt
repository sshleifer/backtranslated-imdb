I watched this movie back in 1984, we first started to see "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to watch this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory going around in your head, you would like to see this. <br /> <br /> The question you should ask yourself when you watch this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do this? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I don't want to give too much information as it would be a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie for yourself . <br /> <br /> But to tell you, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later, and it's not the easiest in the world to try to explain it to humans.
