I loved it, having been a fan of the original series, I have always wondered what the back story would be - failed to please me. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn't recognize someone - it's refreshing, like BSG. It has introduced me to a wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start aeration. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job. The special effects, dialogue and action were all on the spot, and I felt emotionally bound in the story. I know there are purists out there who probably disagree with my judgment, but I thought Caprica was far better than most Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade.
