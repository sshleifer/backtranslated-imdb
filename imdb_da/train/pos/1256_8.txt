This is a very dramatic and exciting movie. There are many reasons and turns. The story or director opens the door to question the death tube or suspected crimes committed by black people. This movie is very orderly by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this, do not miss the "SANDWRITER" or "AGRICULTURE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
