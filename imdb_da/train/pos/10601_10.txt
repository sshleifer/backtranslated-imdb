This very funny British comedy shows what can happen if part of London, in this case Pimlico, had to declare itself independent of the rest of Britain and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. Happy chaos is what would happen. The explosion of a war boom led to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical footnote long ago forgotten. For the new burgundy, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any disturbance from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as the smaller city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's smallest nations. Lady Margaret Rutherford is a pleasure as a history professor sitting with Pimlico. Others in the stand-out cast are Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
