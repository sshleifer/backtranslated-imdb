Basically, this movie is one of the rare movies you either hate and think of suicide as the next best thing to do, rather than having to sit through it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cool hit, one of the movies where humor, the plot, the play is actually very hidden, but for us who are willing to look for it, trust the director, the reward is: You laugh your A .. off !! The fact that you have to find the above things actually makes the movie even more fun because you get the impression that the instructor is not even aware of how much fun his movie is, which seems unlikely, and there is intelligence at the helm of this amazing project called: Spaced Invaders !!
