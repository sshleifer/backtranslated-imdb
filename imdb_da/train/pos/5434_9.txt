The movie was shot at Movie Flats, just off Route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. You can still find splashes of cement and iron beams glued over the rocks where the sets were built. And you will recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to bother with the plot as I am sure it is covered elsewhere. The movie stars three athletes - Fairbanks fils, who must have learned a good deal from his father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical skills are all on display. <br /> <br /> Not a moment of this movie has to be taken seriously. It's about thugees, a sect in India, from which our English word "thug." I can't go through all the film's joys, but I must point out that the director, George Stevens, was a polymath with a background in Laurel and Hardy films - see his choreography of the battle scenes - and continued to the infinitely long resolution of Shane and The Diary or Anne Frank. Dynasties rose and fell. Geological eras came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in "a place in the sun." Here he distinguishes himself in his cartoon. <br /> <br /> This is a story of male bonding and it would be easy - too easy - to read homoerotism into what many people do with the Howard Hawks. Or hate for women. But it is not at all. Sometimes things that appear on the screen do not deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention. Men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, no idea of ​​an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, it is evolution of evolution. For most of human history - about nine tenths of it - hominids have been hunters and collectors, and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather. Hunting is more effective as a team company. Men who were not very good at binding were Darwinianed and left men who have a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin have got it in spades. <br /> <br /> Sorry to stumble upon evolution, but I am an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, who threw the cement and dropped into the bathtub with me? You must see the hooves. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is lovely, really. Could know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister Olivia DeHavilland grew up and went to a monastic school. Pretty place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this adventurous lively, far-reaching chronicle of the British Empahh at its height, you should never forgive yourself. It is so famous that it is parodyed in the Peter Sellers movie, "The Party." Yes - Colonel is knowing.
