The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a huge guy. My father actually recorded it from the TV. I must have seen is over 20 times before the relatively recent release on DVD. I bought myself and saw the DVD and was surprised at how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version that I still have on VHS, the mood of the movie, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. But the new version with Van Der Beek et al. Is more cartoon. <br /> <br /> To put it another way, it's like watching the original American release of Akira with the dub before you see the remastered version with literal translation of Japanese. <br /> <br /> I'm not in any way complaining, the animation and the quality of the animation are not impaired, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki intends to get a brighter or darker narrative and theme in his film. ....
