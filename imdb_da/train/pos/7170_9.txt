HOLES is not your average Disney thing - it is very, very fun, even for adults who usually crawl on the cutesy focus group designed for "family entertainment" as Uncle Walt's studio passes as live action. Perhaps the secret of the movie's success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is slightly darker than your average childhood issues. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a prison prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehabilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story is interwoven with a legendary treasure, and this adventure is ten times as fun as any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp is entitled to. Jon Voight is particularly ugly and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful as always.
