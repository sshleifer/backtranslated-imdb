A child with ideals trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that stores the truth and who violates the rights of existence. A boy inspired by Martin Luther King stands up and tells the truth. A family falling apart and fighting against it. A movie you can't hide from. You see things and you hear things, and you feel things that until the day you die you will hope never happened too real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who cannot do anything, and a boy with, excuse, balls, a boy who will not accept things that will not do anything for him, a child with power and a child who works As a pro, whom he has never done anything else, he finally caries this movie and everyone who wants to see how abuse took place in the 60s.
