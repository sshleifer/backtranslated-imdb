I just don't understand why this movie gets stuck in here. Jeez. It's mindless, it's not polished and it's (as I read) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to 'T' (If you saw Permanent Midnight and became a Ben sets fan then yes, you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well meaning misfits trying to save the city / world with nothing but grin and determination. The problem is that they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was still panned by the same demographic group, probably the same people who feel the first AP movie paws over the sequel. I just don't understand that. The wit works at more than one level; If you didn't, I know what level you're on.
