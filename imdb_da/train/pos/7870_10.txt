The film is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the top society has become. It has lots of characters, and each character represents another category of person. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but everyone is just different. The movie is a very perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the very first time I liked a movie that has raised some social issues. I would recommend everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering Bollywood's hip-shaking parties on the paper, but it's the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all, so it turns out how she could not survive there, and when she helped save some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she's fired from work. Then she couldn't find a job as a criminal reporter and had to do it again. Not only her, but a very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie, and everyone gives a different feeling while watching the movie. I would like to congratulate the director for making such a fantastic movie. Please don't afford to miss it.
