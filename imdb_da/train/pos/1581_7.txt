Goebbel's motivation to support was not explored. In continuation of Stalingrad, the kingdom had decided to go for 'total war'. This is featured in the film. Part of this was to use women in the war effort that Germany had not done to a large extent before. An SS massacre of women would have faced Goebbels with a massive mass public relations disaster. His preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible, given that Jewish men could always be rounded off later. I understand that the majority survived the war. His second problem was that "Red" Berlin had never been very enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be handled carefully. Again, a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what a mediocre level of support they had in their capital. Interestingly, the majority of SS uniforms showed spots that showed that the men wearing them were not of German nationality but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
