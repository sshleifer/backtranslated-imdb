A wonderful and greedy war film focusing on the inner pain of the blind marine Al Schmid. Although difficult and uncomfortable, it is ultimately heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The fighting scene was amazing. But a bone to choose. No matter how many .50 balls they fired, I never saw any water or dirt kicked by the effects! It hurts realism, but I can live with it. Fine performance by Eleanor Parker, again as her girl friend.
