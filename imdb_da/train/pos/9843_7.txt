It composed some characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it is (only made through 20th Century Fox). The trailer for the movie was one of the best I've seen for years, but the film doesn't live up to the expectation that the trailer sets. The problem lies in the fact that film makers have not taken care of who is the target audience for the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the movie is mainly aimed at children. Parents will be delighted that in 90 min. Their children's attention is focused on something other than them. The background is excellent and the voice is good, but it is nothing more a good movie. Children will love this movie, adults will only like it.
