Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is in contrast to driving the turbines produced in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally targeted at a particular audience and should be valued for achieving their goals in that regard. However, Pinjar is an excellent movie for those seeking a change from the normal equation based bollywood movie. Seen at the time of the India-Pakistan partition, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who is the victim of societal and cultural attitudes to the treatment of women of his time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with his family back in Indian rule Punjab. More than a question of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar addresses and defines a woman's role as a daughter, as a wife and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films that are escapist in nature, Pinjar is a movies that make the audience consider these issues during and after the movie.
