Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> On its own, this version of Garbos Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a brand new cast, just toned and refined enough to work better than English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is, if something more commanding (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and her acting is more detained. And she honestly seems more calm, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that she no longer made her first talking image so it was quickly adjusted. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing a movie with Other, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes for a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but it still comes out as oddly old-fashioned. Some scenes are missing - the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good - but in general it is a direct echo of the first movie. Director Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French) simply edits what was already done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. It is interesting to see both movies in sequence, because they are blocked exactly the same (not just the sets, but the shots are all the same). There is an occasional scene lifted from the previous movie - some of the storm, understandably enough, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (from English language version) goes along with her friend on a plank over a channel, full, as it may be . But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is probably no substitute for Dressler, but for me, the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. Clearly the themes - immigration, colorful fathers, daughters turning to prostitution and the problems of finding true love - have strong currents again, especially with European threads (Garbo appropriately plays a Swedish young woman).
