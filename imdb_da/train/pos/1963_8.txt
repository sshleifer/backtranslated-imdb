We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year for the last 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie films for any movie anytime at no cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they are going to write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of pleasure, that's good enough for us! We never listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Good enough about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not just good but very good. The critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language, they hated it. It was well worth the price of the ticket and that's all you can ask for. Is not that right? Every movie cannot be a nominal graduate. Sharon Stone is beautiful and does a good job in the movie and it mystifies me about what the hell critics want
