In my opinion, this is a completely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the grandmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really devilish. You will need to watch the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I unpack it, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this movie did very well. Now I firmly conclude this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece for all of you who haven't seen it. You are in good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, save back with a friend and see it.
