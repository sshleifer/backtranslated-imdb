Carol, the young girl in the center of history, is transplanted to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the civil war conflict in the late 30s. For this girl is all new, in it is alienation. The war and her father are her constant concerns, while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years after her in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe leads this movie with the numbers. Carol's family is apparently divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an air force pilot with the leftist faction, the rest of the family's sympathy is with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story adds nothing to what has already been told much better, but it's an easy movie to see. Nordspanland's magnificent landscape is shown. Don't expect a lot of action, as most of what happens is about Carol and the young boys she's friends with. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who turns to Carol. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left when she left America. This actor, who is usually in the forefront of most Spanish films, has nothing to do as he remains a riddle throughout the film.
