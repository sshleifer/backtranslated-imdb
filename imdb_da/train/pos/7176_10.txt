OK - you will test someone on how pleasant they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes to it - so get their immediate response from seeing this outrageous childhood document making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburbs 80s. More than any movie I've ever seen, the movie of burden occupies sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never boring and spooled into the kind of inherent goodness of young people who are discolored by the terrible adult world where any quirk in youth are accredited to everything from madness to perversion. Mini-Mogul Darren The path seems to reach a deeper understanding of his triumphs and abuses as the patriarch of the strict child's world. What he finds in himself and others is not always beautiful - but shows how to improve and reconcile with age. What does change without reflection mean? I love this movie.
