When I saw the birthday girl, I liked it so much, I went out to see every Nicole Kidman movie I could, to find them all a disappointment to it. I theorize it, while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees some degree of quality because of their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman influencing the influence she exerts on the movie experience - IMHO. Dogville even disclaims the viewer of something visually impairing the existential insight she is hammering at home or other movies that promote homosexual and lesbianism as worthwhile for others' attention or other pet causes for Kidmans. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman, and she does a really good job. I don't know how or who was able to limit her, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays her openness in spite of her resistance comes to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And therefore, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally achievable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the male lead converts from a milquetoast clerk to a macho man in the room of a movie sounds like a male ego-expansion fantasy, but his transformation is sufficiently credible. It is not coyly constructed as it would be in a movie designed to strengthen male ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth as a result of the film's unique circumstances. <br /> <br /> Also quite charming is the way in which criminals are exhibited as completely human, except for their criminal mission. Her gang has a coed rough and tumble community that is foreign to American culture. And while they are his opponents, they are never really his enemy. In fact, they teach him to be competitive. <br /> <br /> I really wondered about Kidman's ability to physically become Russian. It had me wondered if her ancestor was Russian, but none of the pictures of her I examined showed any hint of it. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was great. <br /> <br /> I can only hope they hit her over again soon so she can show up another great movie. Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms kidman, the message is that this is a superior movie in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.
