Despite the title, The Sword Bearer and the DVD cover (action / herioc made up of The Sword Bearer), this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, The Sword Carrier who is cursed by having a retractable sword in the forearm. Cool you say, but no, it's reality. If you had this power as a child, you can control it when you face a sour man or when your mother's boyfriend beats her. And if you don't control it, how can you manage to be a two-time killer at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Wandering aimlessly for another killer (like A Bout de Souffl√©). He then meets Katya, and the couple immediately falls in love and gives Sasha a real reason to live and try to change her ways. But his past still shocks him in the form of two police officers. It is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on the screen, but much if suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superheroes, we get very little history, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword carrier himself) there is a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> Check if you can find it.
