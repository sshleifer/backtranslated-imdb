My father grew up seeing George Reeves as Superman, and when I was a toddler he had episodes on VHS and let me see them, including this movie (passing them in the family if you like) and I loved it. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town of oliemine and is believed to be fatal from the mine, which reaches mules that are radioactive and targeted by the city. to stop this chaos. <br /> <br /> It's just so wonderful and fun to see. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled such a beauty off with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a toddler and I'm 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
