Okay. This movie is a pure pleasure. It has the ever so violent scare mixed with a little suspension and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and it is pleasant to see him do it. This movie is for certain people, though. Either you will absolutely love it or you will totally hate it. A good movie to rent and see when you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
