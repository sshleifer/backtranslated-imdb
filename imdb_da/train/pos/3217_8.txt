Kurt Russell is so trustworthy, and the action is so uninterrupted that it subsequently takes into consideration that there were honest to goodness important themes [overcoming fear of the stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength of love and friendship can bring etc.] in the story. This is so very rare for a 'guy's action girl' that even I [who believes most A / A are violent papers] liked the movie and have recommended it to any guy I know ..... that is Pity that you were overlooked because it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hits - it has something for everyone without compromising on credibility or losing almost non-stop action moments. I'm afraid the answer to it won't be a hit in that adults didn't go to see it. Anyone under the age of 20 has probably not only seen more violent acts in their video games, but probably won't catch multi-layered multi-themed beauty or care about it. This movie can convert anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable survey] to watch this movie, he'll more likely make her go with him to other action flicks.
