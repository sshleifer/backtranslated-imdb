Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force to be used for nuclear power. Unfortunately, Rukh has been contaminated by Radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh begins to get angry because of Radium and antidote and sets out to kill everything he believed wronged him. <br /> <br /> The reason is stupid and the "effects" that make Karloff glow in the dark are ridiculous, but it's still a fun little cooler. It moves fast, has a good mood (note Rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy evening) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give amazing performances. There are also good plays by Franic Drake (like Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (like her mother). So it's OK, but just a tick under all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The reason is just too far fetched for me to swallow. Still, I looked like this. I give it a 7.
