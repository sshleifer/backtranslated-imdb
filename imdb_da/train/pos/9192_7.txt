Let's start this review with a positive note - I'm very happy that they didn't decide to look like Tony is being shot and make a retrospective season like some people were rumors. In fact, the creator and author of this episode David Chase did the opposite. We do not actually know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma, and his chances of regaining are very slim to none. This episode seemed to be moving very slowly, and the coma-induced dream Tony was involved in wrong identity and robbed Asian monks knocking out of him were completely flat out. After 45 minutes I got a little sick of all grieving, but it should not be a reason to slam this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense. Edie Falco gave an amazing career-defining performance in this episode when the conflicted wife was faced with her husband's deathplace. I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ probably won't want the balls to pull off. Silvio is now an actor who opens many doors to problems in later episodes. There were also many good quips in this episode, and I also think that Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can meet his death if he remains a greedy SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a good episode and only disappointed because even if Tony kills people, we as an audience love him and feel he is our hero in the show. This was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a little snoring as part of the conclusion. Kudos to Edie Falco's performance, and David Chase and the authors to create this truly original and unpredictable plot twist. This is the only season of 'The Sopranos' where I don't have a f * cking clue where to go. I can't wait for next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best line of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
