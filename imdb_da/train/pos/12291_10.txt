A real classic. Beautifully busy and acted. Shows an area of ​​Paris that is vibrant and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the "Hotel du Nord" and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the body) and pleasing as it once must have been. The film does a year after the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and bittersweet.
