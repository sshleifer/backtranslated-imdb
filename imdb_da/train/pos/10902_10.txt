I was greatly moved when I watched the movie. How could jonny hold such hope and faith was amazing. So many people just care about what they want, and busy about all the things they don't have. And they are such small things as chothes, money a new car. I've seen people in tears because of a stain. This movie brings everything back to the basics. love, hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life. It makes our daily problems look like what they are small and really unimportant. You look at this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. And the words stop and smell the roses really have a new meaning. and i know jonny will see this and i would like to thank him so much for sharing such faith, strength and humor with me. Thanks to jonny, I know you're hovering the sky and bringing a lot of love and laughter to the sky over.
