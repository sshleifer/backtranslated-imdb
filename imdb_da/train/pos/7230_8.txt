"The Invisible Mouse" is a lovely and different Tom & Jerry cartoon. It has the usual cat / mouse hunts and battles, but in another way this time. Unfortunately, Jerry falls into a bottle of invisible ink and is, of course, very happy about it because he realizes he can prepare lots of "surprises" for Tom, scare him, bother him, and confuse him. <br /> <br /> Seeing as much as we can, it's very cool and fun to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It is fun to see things lift up in the air without seeing who does it (we know who is right?) - It is as if these things had their own life or even almost as a matter of ghosts. Seeing Jerry eating some candy and fruits is as much fun as he is invisible. I really like the instrumental music that plays when he is not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him, and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "missed me". I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becomes visible again and with a good look at his face. Overall, this brief has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some fine illustrations too.
