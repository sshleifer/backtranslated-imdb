Some people say this is the best movie that the PRC has ever released, I am not so sure of it since I have a huge place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I would say that this is probably one of the most unique films, they or any other studio, larger or smaller, ever released. <br /> <br /> The reason is simple. The ghost of a mistakenly made ferry has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring. In this mix, the grandson comes to a ghost victim, the current traveling man. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes on the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Shrouded in dense fog and mostly seen on the only swamp set, this is more musically dense than regular feature film. Lists to the rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early stages, are their poetic cadence for them. Similarly, there is a similar cadence to the camera's work as it travels back and forth over the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson than a normal scarecrow movie. It's a great piece of film making that is probably unique in movie history. <br /> <br /> This is not that Lilly guild. This is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a nice little story that will keep you entertained. Its story of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetic film making, and it keeps you mindful (the technical aspects are just window dressing.) If there is any real error, it is cheap to produce. The fog creates a mood, but it also hides that this swamp is completely on dry land. Constantly back and forth across it is okay for a while, but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me, I like the movie a lot. It is a good little movie that I could wish for, a little less poverty hit. It is definitely worth a look if you can get across it.
