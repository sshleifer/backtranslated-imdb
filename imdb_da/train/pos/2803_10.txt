As a former 2-hour Okinawan Karate World Champion, I like movies about victimizing sports. But this movie is about so much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and basically a catastrophic lack of passion. Almost lit up to me. And this stupid little movie touched me so deeply that it reminded me of what life was about from a drowsiness. This is a movie about living. Live your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God bless "Bend it as Beckham" I think it's a true gem.
