Although I was born this year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until I was in school in June (1996) when I saw it, I was completely confused and laughed and felt with the characters because I and my friends were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were outdated, but the feelings and desperation of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wanted them to make movies like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, I watched this movie the night after I had been at a crazy party (not so unlike the one in Jay's house) that had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts hanging out on our audience's side. A world-class BS and "responsible" figurehead I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car), although I had a little bit of Madge's uncertainties floating around in there as well. My best friend was a Deidre, and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Jeanie is in school or the one where her boyfriend breaks up and then she tells Madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations I personally had. <br /> <br /> Now at the age of 27 I recently saw the movie again and felt a sense of emotion because it was like seeing a piece of myself youth (though none of my friends died). I think it's a must see for all girls 13 and up.
