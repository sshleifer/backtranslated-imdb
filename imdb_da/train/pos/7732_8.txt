The performance in this movie was amazing. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric provided a great performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson short story. Far superior to "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this movie was truly true to the pulp fiction / film noir roots from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all movie noir fans.
