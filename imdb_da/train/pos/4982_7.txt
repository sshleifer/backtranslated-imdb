I love these "diaper baby" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today, and it's rich in film history. It's greasy and the movie was made to make you laugh as it does. How they ever made these children "act" I never know. I think they are precious, and the kids make me laugh, but the others who made this movie do it when it shows the naive that existed in the early 30s. You have to remember that it was here when the movie industry was very young, the stock market had gone down, worldwide depression began, and these movies were made to pause a person from the real world. The fact that you could watch movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then dinner is 25 cents as well. It was another time with a completely different mindset.
