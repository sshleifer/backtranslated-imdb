Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not without interest, far from it: its "heavenly" sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from Abel Gance's ended "la roue") is gradually more convincing than the "over" heavenly world. Borzage's tenderness to his characters shows in Mary's character, and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the end of "three companions"). The amusement park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in Maria's poor house. I do not think the sets are so much cheesy, they are stylized into a mistake. Fairness from a distance almost gives a sci-fi feeling to Borzage never forgets its social concerns: in the celestial train goes up, rich cannot stand to be mixed with the riff, but as "chief magistrate" tells: "here is no more difference ". <br /> <br /> Not a great job for Borzage (not even Lang's version), but to find out if you're interested in the great executive career.
