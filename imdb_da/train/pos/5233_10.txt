One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graff's film as the "event of the event" following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal story is a particular Bart Klever's torturous quest for the ephemeral fabric that constitutes the essence of personality. The writing of his new movie takes shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film monologue comes as an answer to Fellinis `8 Â½ 'and costs Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Exciting to play with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience reveals the capricious interconnection of the real and imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence of two different galaxies: Guttenbergs and MacLhuens. For some time we are inclined to sit with the screenwriter who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window"). And together with him we fall into a trap when the writer finally faces the insoluble dilemma: how to eliminate from the future film. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the final thanks to the common petty accusations of the creator's wife, who is deeply immersed in the work, we realize that along with the protagonist we have been "framed" again. Really, what is the cost of the art for which it is acceptable to renounce its own name and daily care for the young daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet, or someone possessed as Frenhoffer from Balzac's masterpiece (like the latter scriptwriter ultimately deletes from the computer's memory everything has written)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
