Weak writings at times? Yep! Cheesy special effects at times? Yep! Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff that just so much crap. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and it took Carl Kolchak to win me to the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mingled with all the weak writings, cheesy special effects, the baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, Darren McGavin was like Carl Kolchak. He had a sensible sense of humor in spite of his father, was an idealist in his practice of truth and a realist in accepting the mandatory incompetence and eventual disclosure of officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to keep his neck out and do what was to be done, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career or jail time. For all its faults, including no taste in clothing, Carl Kolchak was a charming man who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (who was an old used car at that time) on the way to save the day of humanity. Almost every other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was everyman hero alive every week for a season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he's gone and his show is on DVD, I hope he has fun watching me, watching him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
