Now this show looks like most other shows of the type are from the mid 90s, but the only thing is if this is that it is different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a bit of drama too . Personally, I thought it was a good show, I can't understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the tab base of this show is still alive since 1997 updated. <br /> <br /> I hope WB brings back the show or even makes a movie I know will be impossible to do, but hey doesn't hurt to dream, don't it? <br /> <br /> Anyway I would recommend if you hadn't seen it for the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are good, the story lines are good, comedy is good and well the whole show is just fantastic.
