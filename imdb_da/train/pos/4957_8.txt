10 POINTS OR LESS were made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by author / director Brad Silberling, just a small movie shot in Carson, CA that feels like the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman between his major projects with the Spanish actor Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different heads who can improve the life of the other. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - another part of the comedy is that he is portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a place for a little 'filler film' to Get back in the flow of things. His role is to be a Market Administrator, and he has fallen on a cool market in Carson, where he meets a Scarlet, the girl on the 10-item argument, or Smaller checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry at her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale) who is currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy colleague (Anne Dudek) and her inability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two couples after a few shared issues and outside, they go on a 'road trip', resulting in each of the characters growing from the second presence and life story. It's a simple story, simply told, but because of the boundary bond between Freeman and Paz, it works very well. This is one of the small films on human relations where it is vulnerable to change and exchange the message. It's worth seeing, and it's a DVD that has featurettes that touch, informative, and comic - a pleasure to see. Grady Harp
