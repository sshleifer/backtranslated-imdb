Halloween is one of the movies that makes you deep skin! It is, in my opinion, the most horrible movie all the time. Michael Myers is the best boogy man ever! He was just as scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects to tell how the computer is animated, it was a low budget and had a node score, but managed to scare hell out of people. 25 years, and this film still has the same effect as it did in '78. It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do everything to get him back when he describes Michael as "pure evil, the hardest eyes, the eyes of the devil". Michael is on a mission to kill his second sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween, while her friends are partying and of course we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie can stand a chance since she is the virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays many tribute to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely fantastic movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows and turn off the lights! "They'll get you! They'll get you!". Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
