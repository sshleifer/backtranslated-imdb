I love bed knobs and diet cuts so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the magnificent joy of seeing it. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love it so much. Too many have said. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all straight. I also love others who love it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on Portobello Road. I have learned dance moves and practice it every day. I have some sound recordings of myself singing the song. If anyone can play drums or guitar I am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band.you hope to call it the 'buds'. love me (liz)
