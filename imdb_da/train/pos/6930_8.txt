This is quite an unusual and unique little western made mostly original due to its history of a unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who will put it at some point in the movie. <Br /> <br /> It is mostly a very entertaining movie to watch, but not without being a true western too. The film was performed in a typical 40's 50's style with Western genre film making, so the lovers of the genre should not be rejected by its somewhat unusual main preference. Because the gun is actually the main plot unit of the movie, it allows history to follow several characters throughout the movie, all of which are connected of course and the story makes the whole circle last. Without this, this movie would have been quite cluttered as history often jumps from one dangerous occasion to another, with constantly different characters involved. Absolutely amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in this whole. But there is no criticism really. I liked that the movie and its history were original and how the movie seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the film a little sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a really nice movie. I liked the settings the movie used, and it seems absolutely amazing that this was actually the director Anthony Mann's first Western. Fortunately, he would continue to lead more Westerners later, which would often star James Stewart in the lead. <br /> <br /> Choosing James Stewart as the lead leader was a pretty daring casting choice. He is one of the gentlest and most polite looks and actors, so he throws like a hard pistol thong as a bit of an odd choice. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a hard guy, and it shows how versatile and real the actor he actually was. <br /> <br /> It also has some other surprising actors in the movie that are not often associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female leader and also later known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with plenty of action and entertainment for it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
