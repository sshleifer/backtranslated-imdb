I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal controlled the world. Trick or Treat has each element for a movie that cuts. With a cast that has Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Backward vicious messages are played on vinyl! Yes, that's right they use records in this movie. In a scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from the evil rockstar on his turntable when things start to get scary. Monsters begin to come out of their speakers and his stereo becomes obsessed. As a teenager I tried to play my records backwards and hoped it would happen with mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick or Treat is still one of my all-time favorite films.
