The story is told fluidly. There are no interruptions. Flashbacks are woven into the present seamlessly. Casting was excellent. Young Ya'ara looked so much like that Ya'ara would have looked at that age. Her portrayal of a blind person was made convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a great job of getting the various actors to work together in this story. The cinematography is very good. You want to be with Ya'ara and Talia, going towards the sea to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that although "Without Vision" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very relevant to history.
