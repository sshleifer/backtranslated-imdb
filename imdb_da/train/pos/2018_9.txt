I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> It could have used a little more screen time for the yummy Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "at it" from the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one who most excited me through surprising shock and awe and wonder was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Forsyte Saga and everything else I've seen him in. But he educates himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not have portrayed him playing a demented psycho like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
