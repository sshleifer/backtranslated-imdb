I could imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would become an icon and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" that year, this movie came out or was in The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not have done so. But he did, and we are the richer for it. It is certainly a classic. Scare the way it was supposed to be for the drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film's last lines were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They would never have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would thaw. Blob will return soon.
