This movie is just fun. mindless, but fun. To enjoy this movie altogether, you can't get a sense of how a movie like this goes and just enjoy all the jokes and puns involved in the movie. I still find little at first fun when he says "want a beer ........ cock". fun stuff. But what makes the movie decent is the fact that it doesn't make it hard to make a serious spin on the movie. Too many comedies are trying to get serious aspects that you just don't believe in. But it's different and just focuses on being fun. However, I have to say that Yasmin bleeth is horrible in the movie and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, straps and squeak are very funny to see and make the movie great to watch
