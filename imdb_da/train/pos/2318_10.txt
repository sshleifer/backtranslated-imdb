I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspons portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana around 1957. She feels that she never gets as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (one now rarely seen Emily Warfield) and feel out of place with her conservative Baptist education. Then seventeen-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), son of her mother's closest friend (Gail Strickland) moves in the next door, experiences Dani's first infatuation while Court enjoys his company and intentional spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls over her heels and leaves Dani behind. The sisters' close ties are severely broken by the rivalry that goes forth, which is only elaborated when the Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls are then made to realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents who are trying to balance their daughters' individuality while trying to keep the family together. The beautiful movie and the wonderful soundtrack with Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others wonderfully contribute to the movie's atmosphere in a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A touching movie with a timeless message.
