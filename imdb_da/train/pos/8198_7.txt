Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting his attackers in the goolies before killing them. Probably a more appropriate punishment would be to let them live after the first shot and let them suffer forever as she and her sister have ... Anyway ..... an action-packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main raven played by Andy Drake is appropriately boring and gets his sentence at the end (of course!). Not a classic movie, but better than the others except the original Dirty Harry.
