I loved this movie. It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam, and this movie-s fight scene and exciting bombs and gun fire did it. I had no idea that I would be so affected by it. What a fantastic look at how alien Vets feel. It was hard to see, frankly. We all understand the fighting and the Apocalypse Now type of drama, but it is so so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not. It made me very aware of a large group of men who rattled about lost in America. Not able to relate, can not sleep, can not have love relationship, can not deal with "the normal society". They feel completely apart. This is an enormous tragedy and one that is not sufficiently attentive. Yes, we have changed our attitude to Vietnam Vets, we like them now, but then what? It doesn't seem to have made any difference to them. It is too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
