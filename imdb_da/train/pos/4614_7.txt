This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this part of "Guilty Pleasure". It is easy to condemn this movie not to include Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had grown their parts for a long time! Time makes it young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who re-praised her role as Lili, shot Big 6-0 (though she still looked good and was the perfect "Lili"). It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo didn't get a bigger part. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the 2 seasons that THE MUNSTERS was at prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series such a success. The rest of the cast supported cast members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not have survived as long as it did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice over Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not measure up to the original TV series, it still measures nicely and is one of the better "reunuin" TV shows that plagued the chest during the late 1970s the early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
