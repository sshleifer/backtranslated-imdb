For my humanities quarter school project, I chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished seeing it, and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow". It's such a compelling story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The end leaves you breathless, and although it is not a happy-ending end, it is very realistic. It's great and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric, and your heart breaks down for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next time!
