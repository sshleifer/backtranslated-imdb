Before entering politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's finest movie actresses. This movie shows her talent despite having a supporting role in a star cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, king of a British royal captain who has lost her memory for the past 20 years, and Jenny played by American Ann-Margret in almost unrecognizable role as doting sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who is suffering from memory loss triggered by shell shock during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a minor role as the doctor treats him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can't help but see Glenda playing a dowdy housewife and the captain's first true love, but they came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's good to see Glenda's amazing talent. She is still a great actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Gray a likeable character and you can see why a royal captain fell in love with her.
