This typical Mamet movie gives a quiet, steady pace of insight into what makes a trustee (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), she slowly pulls her into her world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The shock includes a number of the players available, several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good jobs. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and have often wondered why she didn't become a more known player than she has become. Maybe I don't look at the right places! <br /> <br /> The movie goes slow, with a flat dialogue, but it maintains a level of excitement that logically leads to the end. You would expect a real failure at the end but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!
