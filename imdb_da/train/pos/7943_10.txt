I love this TV show so much. It contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can't believe they cut it off TV and also that I've never found out if cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show ever. I know it too late to hope they will start the series again, so I'm really glad to see it. I was so much <3 <br> <br /> about a woman named cybersix, she is not human. She goes from adrian sieldman, a male teacher at a high school. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she's just disguised as a man today. At night, cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created cybersix, and when he finds out she is alive, he uses everything he can to capture her. <Br /> <br /> If you've never seen it before you had to download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why do they cut off ?? Some people have problems. but I'm glad to see the 13 episodes.
