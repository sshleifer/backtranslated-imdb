I watched this movie for the first few seconds, the voice of T.R. took me on the journey - well I did not like the big glued thumbs in the beginning, but the absurd humor it and the huge look of both sissy actors - I do not know who played the young her - but she was amazing and it was also uma !!! - <br /> <br /> The other two people where in the cinema went out after approx. half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a try to watch a movie, I like one of my friends - and we both enjoy it for the maximum - fun grinning about the "realistic police -normalos ". we both fans of T.Robbin's books ... I found it well done - thought that Robbins would also approve even though I don't have an idea if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br /> I would love to see the carved things - I heard that gus v. sand had to take many scenes because of the first-time walkers (or the producers ???), but it is still an artistic film. too short but ... it's one of my favorites all the time - and I realize that most people can't stand that kind of movie and suppose people who enjoy the movies are what they think ... .... what a shame. hopefully the day comes that there will be a DVD with the full material - hope to see more of crispian, keanu - expect to see her baby and everyone <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, think twice and enjoy it if you have chosen to see ... m
