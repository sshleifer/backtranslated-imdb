Richard Widmark is a character in this movie. He is a professional bag. He has been in prison three times, but at the start of the film he tries to do four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl blazed by Widmark. <br /> <br /> This is a while under the McCarthy era where Red Scare ruled politics and is incorporated into this plot quite nicely. What is unusual about this movie is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent battles in an era where women rarely were more than films in films. That's what makes this movie noir, as women often have different roles in this type of movie. The film is only 87 minutes long and was of course made by Fox as the sub-card for dual functions in the theater. The sets show that it is a limited budget film. Scripture made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given concise. Hoover would have changed it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became a B under the map, which was a sleeping hit in 1953. The script and action in it is better than other great features that year.
