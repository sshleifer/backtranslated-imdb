I don't think I'll ever understand the hatred of Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most amazing action movies ever. That's right, your little punks, Cliffhanger rules, and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue club who "just visits" his old town when asked to help A former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) helps save on a mountaintop. Walker, of course, came back at an appropriate time, because the strict people are actually a sophisticated team of twenty led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a lot of money, they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, and they really want to have it back ... Essentially, 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just act within the framework of the Nakatomi Plaza for the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out our hero's weaknesses and keep him deadly. Of course, this setup is completely torn down for shredding fast enough, as Stallone's character avoids quite a few bullets with ease and strikes first in several stone surfaces without apparent side effects. After all, that's not what action movie is about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action films around. A showcase of amazing scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie doesn't get better than it did at first, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithow's leading villain is entertaining and a bad guy. Probably one of the coolest lead villains ever. 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, certainly Renny Harlin's best bet and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
