Turn a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khourio's book Forbidden Love, and it was a best seller. A bullying of literary scams and a beautiful woman, Lie $, is the very best in editorialized reality TV. <br /> <br /> Beautifully edited and colorful, Broinowski's storytelling is chapter by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke. I disagree (with Variety) that it is prolonged; Instead, my one weak problem was the episodic character of its key actors who commented on the fair testimonials of others. On a single view, your sense of story becomes mired ..... so I saw it twice. This Oscar-worthy effort is really fun, confusing and totally exciting, as it documents a lie after another. It apparently unfolds in the Australian state of Queensland via very personal scams of Khourio's friends and fans (!). It is clear that these friends are now "turned", the funniest on-line line belonging to Khourio's QLD neighbor Rachel Richardson, who speaks her disillusionment in flat, no-nonsense colloquialisms: "I think it's a burden of personal! ". /> <br /> We need to learn from their experience, therefore my belief in spoilers. Any perennial liar caught in a lie will just say something to buy time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There is some breathtaking image of Khouri colliding with popping this very documentary, which instead pushes her (con) "Artist" repeatedly to confirm. <br /> <br /> The page was busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after the release, Khouri has been on the run, but was tempted back to the director for apparently clearing her name. She allegedly absconded because a) she was either frightened by her sweet, more Italian-sounding than Greek man, or b) because she needed her passport / visa to clear her name. <br /> <br /> It was unlikely. <br /> <br /> One more plausible reason was that the FBI regained its track in Queensland before she again jumped abroad (a guess: No, not Jordan). According to a final card, Khouri is still "under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. I guessed the audience could just give the Khouri the benefits of doubt when she claimed the need for extreme secrecy and subterfuge. Instead, the audience I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the people on the screen. When they were trapped, there were plenty of counterparts and cathedrals; Previously, stressed sugars had originated from audiences, who just didn't know how to take Khourio's evolving contradictions. The filmmaker gets props so beautifully to span this horrible tale from the beginning to the end, and not leave anything out - not even his own self-sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book story by Khouri herself. The reliable reason for preparing it is, above all, very credible - the key to how a lifelong liar works: in half-truths. Khouri is nevertheless a very beautiful and smart 35-year-old with a little disarming charm and surprisingly prepared biceps. Gradually, we are introducing smaller and less adulterous Aussie journals, publishers and fans who initially purchased the scale of Khourio's murderous accusations hook, line and sinker. Later, we see their more rueful reactions, rather self-directed and material if some are a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> It was Jordanian (anti-murderous) activists who took deepest umbrella on Khourio's flaws, because its cold-running forced them to slow down the pace of change. Honorary killings are taking place in Jordan; It's just their prevalence that is in contrast to Khourio's book - plus 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists (Australian) faxed Random House with 73 carefully controlled objections. The publishers across 4 continents who had jumped on the chance to publish the first time, author Khouri never tried to control any facts. Leaving any confirmation of a disclaimer in their author's contract, they were also fair games. So a massive hot topic scam was just as easy to commit the world as writing it in internet cafes. Later, we are shocked to find that the "erroneous mistakes" extend to Khourio's bio as well. First, she is not only a 35-year-old virgin (her defense is that she just didn't disturb people of their assumptions), but she has a slickster man and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she is just too quick to talk in her American accent. She also works for comfortable with cell phone technology and western clothing. I realize observations like these may be detrimental to the very Jordanian women who do not need any western paternalism from me, but when even cultural signs do not jibe beyond Khourio's "facts," you must start questioning your source. <br /> <br /> At one point, the film maker came to the same conclusion. She makes an admirable effort to keep Khouri in personality in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a fact trip back to Amman, where a "fact" after the other falls. Eventually, Broinowski forces her (con) "Artist" to admit the 10-year difference in her story, and after that Khouri records her exciting secret confession in her own digital camera. Secret, because in that Khouri's "US Security Guard", Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never find out how Anna uncovered it.) <br /> <br /> Then it becomes the filmmaker's triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment. Her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from others' mistakes in the face of such a high degree of reasonable doubt, FBI documents - and Khourio's most shocking original crime. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski (see list here now) is even clever enough to use one artistic entity (key players cross comments on recordings) to kill two birds - so her audience will drink from the same well again. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite her misleading approach, she confirmed that Overington and Knox really won their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their "Norma Khouri Investigation". <br /> <br /> Broinowski made me look.
