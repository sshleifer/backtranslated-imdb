<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie even if it's fun if you don't get the references as a straight comedy. <br /> <br /> Not much of the very hung CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little storm has. <br /> <br /> Have not heard from the people involved since, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think a lot of dialogue, while invaluable in Tap is more fun here, probably because I am more into rap than rock theses days, so do my own judgment cloud pointing. The rap songs are fun as hell, and it's basically the place for the reference to most of the movie, not everyone is in your face, which means the physical comedy and the one-liners take precedence over the starts. <br /> <br /> Fun, one to watch twice if ever there was a movie.
