This is a must for independent film fans, but it also does well with regular movies. I think we have the opportunity for the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects and seemingly ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) - And yet, this movie takes hold of you and never lets go. The play is a bit bizarre, but the actors and the director pull it off with complete realism. It has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> No point in describing the details. To see an independent <br /> <br /> masterpiece, a virtual lesson on how to make a low budget girl that really works, see this. <br /> <br /> - Oh yes, it's also really entertaining. <br /> <br />
