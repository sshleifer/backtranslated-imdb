79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never did anything but good movies together. Though this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical. There are a couple of excellent songs, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable performances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable early screen performances. The ball is particularly good and also a blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best musical songs ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Rogers sister. The basic plot is pretty familiar, but with a cast this extraordinary, it works. Excellent art direction and score.
