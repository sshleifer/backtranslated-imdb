This movie is great for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and makes it a relevant social comment. Groovin 'Gary is a small town kid who is (supposedly) well-liked for his many impersonations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This results in him making various reasons for his actions so that people do not think he is actually a transvestite or other such social exclusion. In the second part, Harris exploits the fight between Gary and Beaver in a beginner's attempt to make a story out of the original documentary. The third and final trilogy rate is really great for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a really uneasy character. He struggles to gain acceptance in his own community to no avail. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John removes him even more from the people who already consider him social exclusion. The film is depicted so realistically that it, as reality, lends itself to many reactions. Surely you can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic sign, but can also identify with him as an outcast.
