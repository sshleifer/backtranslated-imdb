I absolutely love this movie and really want to have it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I can't remember too much about it, but an Indian boy lives in a lovely village with his family, and I can't remember what happens, but he only needs to go to the desert. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come out and put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated by legends, especially Native American legends, and I would love to see this released one day for a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, the one who is concerned!
