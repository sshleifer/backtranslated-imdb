In this film from 1943, Judy Garland is considered not to be ready for the great time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This movie was definitely a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supportive Oscar win the year before in "Johnny Eager." <br /> <br /> Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widow of 5 children, with four of them looking like her grandchildren? <br /> <br /> The song and the dance are just wonderfully staged, but the way the flowering romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left much to be desired. It was a Gigi-like, where a young girl eventually swept off the feet of a charmer.
