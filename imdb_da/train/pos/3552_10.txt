I just want to add my two cents and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel worth remembering people about the everlovinian genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderful street, Damon Runyon's funny writings would never be made - or most other classics dealing with gamblers and the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from Colorado, but he certainly did on the East Coast street scene. If you're not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker", both have Bob Hope, who, apart from his policy, has always been a fun man. (As a west coast liberal, I find his politics quite fun too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
