RKO had a reputation for making folksy, homespun pieces of Americana. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (like Dawn O'Day) had been in movies since she was a toddler. In 1933 she was in limbo - had played Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Annes work from a previous movie, and that was how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a delicious boat, the "stolen" brooch, the "redhead" event. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty, heartfelt orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her eagerness to please and also her burning temperament. UP. Heggie was wonderful as understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley were fine as the Marilla company. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in the movie as a toddler, was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden turned out to play a different from Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs Barry.
