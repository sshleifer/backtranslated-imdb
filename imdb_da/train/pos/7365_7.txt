I found it very touching, as Spike and Heaton stay together all the way through this movie, not to say that there are no treacheries along the way. I thought the hunt was set aside, the relationship between the two was the foreground, I believe. I had already guessed that there were so gay intentions from Heaton. My favorite scene had to be the bit where Heaton and Spike stood in the bog and Spike ran off. I generally thought Spike didn't come back. I must say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher makes us see this I would never have seen it. All in all, I thought this movie was pretty good and I would recommend it to any fan of British movies.
