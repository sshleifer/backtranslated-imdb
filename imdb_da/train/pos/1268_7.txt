Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three movies, Cape Fear, The Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and blends it together to come up with a good thriller of a movie. Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former assistant district lawyer, Kate Capshaw, and he is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle his grandson's appeal. He sits on the death row of the murder of a young girl. When Connery arrives in this rural Florida County, he is up against a hard sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is inconsiderate in his crime solution that Orson Welles was in touch with. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery gets the sentence set aside with evidence he's uncovered, he feels pretty good about himself. At that time, the film takes a certain tour from the Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that everything is not what it seems to say the least. The casting becomes uniform in some good performances. There must be mentioned Ed Harris, who plays a Hannibal Lecter as serial killer on the death row with Underwood. He will crawl your skin and he begins to make Connery mention some of the comfortable liberal premises he has based his beliefs on. Many a confirmed liberal I have known have come out and think quite differently when they have become a crime victim. <br /> <br /> Of course, the reverse is just as true. Many a law and order conservative, if ever involved in the wrong end of the criminal justice system, will ensure that all his rights are guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The criminal law is not an end, but a process and one never ends for the whole of society. I guess if only cause has a morality that would probably be.
