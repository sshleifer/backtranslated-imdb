Loved Joan. Great performance. What she is not good at. I saw this movie and then Jane Eyre right after ... she just gets better. My heart was racing. Big old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm glad I got it on video. Don't know what more you need in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a try ..... The costumes are very nice. Do I wonder what the budget was for this movie? Want the still made movies like this one. When they try, they just seem to make a cheesy movie. Movies in black and white still have a certain mystery.
