A wonderful quirky movie with enough twists for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she thinks. The story is very heavy in the cheek, and the dialogue is skillfully undervalued. Tips on humor and intrigue, none of which overrides the characterization Posey pulls out so well. The support molding is stellar. The downside? This movie needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal in her lift of an eyebrow than most actresses have throughout the body. She is worth your time, even if you do not understand the denouement.
