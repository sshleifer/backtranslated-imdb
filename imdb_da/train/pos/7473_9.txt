Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Gradually, Crowe's manuscript is much tighter and more generous than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker must get the credit for thinking about the story first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved it - if only a little. Note that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the leadership of VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by more "fleshed out."
