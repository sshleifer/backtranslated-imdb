Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of nerds run around and say that Return of the Jedi is not good because it is actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked the return of Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now, suddenly people are watching you as if you have some kind of illness if you mention how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever considered creating that it bogged down my mind that the man himself would think of condemning it. This movie is great fun! It's as amazing as I remember it was when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! His is not correct! <br /> <br /> And the Ewok song at the end ruled! I bet people don't even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'll fire you!
