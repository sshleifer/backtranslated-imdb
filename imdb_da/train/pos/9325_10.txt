I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I would give it a try. The plot is about Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo shout first about who did what. But later, Theo finds that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching their differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an incredible movie. I've only seen Colm Feore in season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have never heard of before, did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those interested in the gay and lesbian genre. This is a movie you will not miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
