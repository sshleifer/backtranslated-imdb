great Ramones fan. I like the ramons and I suppose if you hate them, so besides being an avid bush supporter, you don't like this classic. It is immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen movie and as it was in the 80s. infinitely better than the American Pie who is bothering us now. <br /> <br /> There are some other major colleges: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and the cheesy yet gripping (don't seem possible) River Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it is the funniest and most fun, plus you can stand up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
