I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still hangs on me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movies, it is the one I always seem to mention first. There are some movies (works of art like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch somewhere in you, somewhere so protected and hidden, yet so sensitive that they give a lifelong impression on the viewer , not in contrast to a life-changing event, such as the end of a serious relationship or a friend's death ... This movie "shook" me when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
