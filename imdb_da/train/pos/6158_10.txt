What can I say about a story like this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood and evokes warm memories in my heart. The characters lead you to so many whimsical places that make you want more of each scene. For example, in the market there were so many different flavors. I loved the exotic dancers that came with the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story was wonderful. I wanted so much for Landsbury to keep the perishable children and for her to stay with Mr. Brown and find the other half of the spelling so that the men less armor could win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid inside, and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my absolute favorite of all time. I hope that all children will be able to see this classic and be swept away and transported to another time.
