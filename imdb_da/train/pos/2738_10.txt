I haven't seen this for over 20 years, but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie could NOT be made in color. The clear grays are what it does, and was life really that simple in the 1950s? What matters most in my memory is that Perry Smith goes to the gallows. His breathing under the hood just before they jumped the trap. I don't think I could see it again ..... once is enough. It is such a named guy at the beginning of "Papillon" who is drawn out in fear of the guillotine. The guy who said watching this on a double bill with "Dead Man Walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live" as well. <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors were "aristos" went to the guillotine in 1794-95 so my feelings on the death penalty are quite intense.
