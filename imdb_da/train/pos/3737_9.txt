First, this movie was a wild ride all the way. The story of the soldiers' training, struggling with their superiors, and eventually grouping together. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. This is a war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (sometimes without reason) and the horrors of what boot camp is. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout history, from camp to Tigerland, and eventually helps. <br /> <br /> The innovative free-motion film added some flavor or flavor to the movie. Constant movement, constant action and just constant confusion. At times it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, it became more realistic. Some points in the movie (especially the sex scenes) seemed to be just a little too realistic, although they added an effect to the movie that would not have been there without them. It was a very brave movie through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better films (if not his best performance). The action for each character was excellent. 9/10 ssnuk3r
