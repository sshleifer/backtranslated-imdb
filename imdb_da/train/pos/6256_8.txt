I can get in front of myself here, but even though the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I saw it broken on TCM last night, I ask myself: Why did they do it? how many of them died on the trip, why should they do such a life-threatening journey just to find food for their animals (!) when they reached "milk and honey land", why didn't it? Don't they just get there? Do you want to threaten your life and your entire community to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it was to make it for that purpose alone, it shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. Risk death for a cow ?? Better them than I do!
