The movie shocked me. Personally, I had the most bad buzz. Well, after having owned the DVD for months, I put it on a sleepless night. Although the film needed, the extra recording was used for the purpose of his passion and his restoration from the addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had omitted any scenes. The best thing about the movie is that it is consistent with the relationship. There was no ex's popping up or sign threatening the relationship. I typically think we see that the girl meets a boy with some amazing fate floods, they date something we then come up, break them up and then they come together again in the last five minutes of the movie. But this film did not follow that mold. We have actually experienced the relationship, and it is lacking, and although the characters had moments of anti-laws, they did not have dramatic breaks as they went out and made a fitting every 15 and reunited in love again. I didn't feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. The story was unique and truthful to reality in the way I felt these people in the movie were the most credible I have seen in a romantic movie of the present time. And it didn't hurt that all baseball games were real and they were in the real world series so fate kicked in a little there too. It's not "My Lovely Lady", but it's a lively and honest movie. I just want to say I like it.
