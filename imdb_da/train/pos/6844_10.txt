"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best movie, an absolute thrill of excitement, humor and style that remains unmatched today. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood that most people claim to overthrow Alfred Hitchcock. He doesn't. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original unknown version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy published by Goodtimes is Jack Valenti's approved R-rated cut. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. It is the one that is distributed by Warner Home Video, in both a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical silver lining poster. These are the ones that need to be downloaded if you can find a copy. I have the green and it is among my valuable belongings. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to history. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. On a trip to the museum (a real tour-de-force for DePalma in terms of camera work and excitement), <br /> <br /> Miller is picked up by a stranger. You can basically guess what is happening to her as the art of advertising and boxing gives away the story. But there are some complications. A hooker (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius destined to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message about it ... about a missing razor sharp ... I do not waste the movie at all for you, as what I have described above is within the open half hour and DePalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour. However, this movie is explicitly enough for Valenti (head of MPAA) to demand cuts in the movie. What surprises me is what cuts he wanted. More cuts in the opening shower stage and one or two slashing scenes and some of Nancy Allen's dialogue (Valenti wanted "cock" changed to "bulge"). This is a movie that is very violent and bloody, but the objections are sexual content. I want to hear Valenti's explanations of how to see two women in a loving love scene in "Lost and Delirious" somehow more detrimental to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who blows people with a chain runner. It's just not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate, but the performances are also very good. Michael Caine, who was in a lot of nap during this time, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because she actually has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her selection of performances that have been linked together as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as a genius and I loved all the inventions of his. DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. The latest joke of the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they were actually going to open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma has fried his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho". It's a shame that very few actually know it. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
