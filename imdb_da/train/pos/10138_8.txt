Now it's time. I had really given up and hoped that there would be a standout episode among the season's entrances. While there have been far too many killings for hohum entrances, this episode proved good. It is quite fun that director Rob Schmidt, who only does it badly. Wrong turn to his credit and author John Esposito whose only writers have so far included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones that give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. In "Right to Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the start of the episode, the couple has a conversation. Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he desperately tries to win her back. While speaking, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is back with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown away from the car and caught fire when a spark turns on and petrol that has dropped on her catches she is in fire. And that's just the setup members. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide whether Abbey should live in this condition without skin and only nerve reflections. There is also a side effect too. Every time she flutter, Abbey goes like a ghost and causes trouble for all kinds of people. Hands down is the best episode of the season and is certainly one of the best episodes ever. From the cruel effects on the tight script that threw a few twists, so I never, come and thrill so tangibly that you can almost touch it, Right to Die should have the right to live forever.
