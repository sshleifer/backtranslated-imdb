Fantastic entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The movie was made for me! Fun lines in the manuscript, good music. Dalton as the hard sheriff and Railsback as "redneck villain". I must recommend this movie to any action-adventure fan! 10.10
