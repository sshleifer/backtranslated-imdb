Here's an oddity: a modern movie about a serial killer who doesn't have battle scenes, no one has seen dying, no car chases and no loud noises ..... and it happens in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are horrific. The rest of the story is detective work and how much bureaucracy the bad detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very bleak movie, and "gloomy" describes the best personality hero (Stephen Rea). Still, the story is not depressing, and it is very interesting throughout. <br /> <br /> Rea is outstanding as decided, harried-looked detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is actually scary as the killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspected, but he plays the only character in this movie that has some warmth. <br /> <br /> Once again, the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with only one and two references to bias against homosexuals, the overall validity of secular psychology, the police and officials are boorish / crude / bigoted, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is an intelligent and refreshingly low-key crime movie. This is a unique movie that is not known, but likes the people who have seen it. Since it is based on a true life account of this killer, it is the more chilling. Don't leave this just because you have nothing to do with it.
