The reason people say this movie scared them is because it did! This means that the film's purpose was felt by a couple who saw it. When I first saw this movie, I scared me and made me think of life and religion. This is not a blood and make scary type of movie, but the kind you think might be possible for things to happen, as the movie was written. Of course, believers will not say that it is only a sci-fi movie. The truth is, this movie is a must for your thriller collection, even though it has a religious view. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen .. etc) this is one of them and it is a must. I never saw the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I think it will pick up where this movie ends.
