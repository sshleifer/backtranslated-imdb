I happened to borrow this movie from a friend who didn't know anything about it, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary on a journey on an old vessel across vast seas. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the sea to Polynesia based on certain relics found in both places, certain types of ancient shipping ships that we know they had access to. , analysis of ocean and wind currents and knowledge that the Incas actually traveled for an indefinite amount at sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as close as possible to what the old Incas had available, using only balsa wood and other available materials at that time and from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach Polynesia's islands, about 5,000 miles away. <br /> <His theory, which so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey strongly supports his right. The film is really a little more than the story of recordings taken during the 100-day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of how it was and the trials and tribulations they faced. I often want the academically award-winning documentaries to be easier to find, and this from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released.
