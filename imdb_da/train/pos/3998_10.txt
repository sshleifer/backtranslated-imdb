I somehow missed this movie when it came out and discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can't remember another intimate dramatic movie that does so many things as well. Scripture is sharp, realistic, nuanced and even detained. Cinematography and editing are discreet but inspired so that visual storytelling can dominate through stunning close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways. The action is also amazing, with all the characters painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways a movie can offer. They reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team. One must look for serious movie lovers.
