This is Jackie Han's best movie and my personal favorite. Following the disappointing U.S made 'The Protector' directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and slammed it to Hong Kong. This is probably Jackie's most violent film, where the audience crawls on the bone fractures. The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew put a lot of effort into the battle design. The bones were broken and blood spilled in the process of making this movie that you want to see in the credits. Scripture is a simple police and robbery affair, nothing special, after all, it was written around action. I have to say that the English version has some risky dubbing, but it shouldn't put you too much. So let the killer round, crack open the beers and enjoy. By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the stunt staff. Why? I will let you find out for yourself !!
