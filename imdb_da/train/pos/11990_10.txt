In the year 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was certainly the primary. Performances such as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Rubber Bears were already popular, and now Disney made another great comic, and the cartoon brought the birth of Disney Afternoon. The cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old Jungle Book character Baloo the Bear when he gets a job in the airline industry. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirate and good cloud surfer, business lady Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very fun and has tons of good sayings that you may not understand as a child but understand later in life. This is a smartly written series and it is great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your kids and let them see all those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
