The following picture (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines like legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a nice biopic. Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being tamed as The Next-It-Girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous Vanity Fair tire story among other media headlines, but despite a few contributing roles here and there her predicted star style seemed to blink less brightly so far. Here, as the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is a shining star in ascending. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born Tennessee as a God-fearing and family-oriented beautiful girl who seemed to find even the unwarranted subject of desire and love as she grew older. A flashbacked gangster is cleverly not graphically depicted, nor is the subtle display of his own father having less than decent designs for his own family, which is important to understand how Page managed to escape the possible nightmare life For a career as an actress heading to New York City in the 1950s, it was actually time and place to be catching lighting in a bottle. Which side didn't know she would actually be when she came. <br /> <br /> A beautiful ravenous girlfriend with a divine figure. Page is spotted at Coney Island a summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph leading to her in her basement and ultimately to study Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who meet their kitschy but considered pornographic still images for a unique clientele: fetish types. <br /> <br /> Although Side is quite naive, she is unthinkable smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least stays in what is offered to her as a workman in that it is not indecent, and she is having fun in her less-adhered portraits - until a congressional hunt searches for a few sins to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> Talent filmmaker Mary Harron and her writer partner Guinevere Turner ("An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") streamline the biopic stairs quite nicely and perhaps a little too fast to find out who really was Bettie Page, although they do justice in portraying an era of optightness by their zenith. Great thanks to the talented cinematographer Mott Hopfel for his languourously beautiful black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk's era film for his melodramatic kindlings. Part feminist treaty and part American dream met the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by the ensemble, including the comic Bauer and Taylor as siblings in the dirt and Harris has a market as a fellow photographer with taste for wine and talk. It is entertaining to see Strathairn in a bit of stunt cast as a senator on a campaign for justice after presenting news bulldogs Edward R. Murrow in his last outing, "Good Night and Good Luck" as opposed to the table roll. <Br /> <br /> But hats off to Mol's real talents as the unrestrained, yet deeply moral and most importantly intelligent Bettie Page, which lets its child-like innocence beam through its bold nudity and current tame and picturesque-borderline kitschy, Captured the male fancy for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the whole world. Mol is perfect and likewise resembles her portrait's subject down to her scientific smile. The real Bettie Page was reportedly not involved in the project, but apparently gave her a blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life, pointed out in the last moments of finding Jesus and rejecting her "infamous" image once and for all. A shame as this film strangely embraces the resounding decency that is permeated within its subject and radiates for everyone to see in its naked splendor.
