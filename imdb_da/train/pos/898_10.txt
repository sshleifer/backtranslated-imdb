One should be very jaded not to be swept up in this gem of a movie (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies too). The actors, the beautiful surroundings, places and surroundings, the deep emotions depicted, the sweet songs (especially Udit Narayan's singing voice, my favorite) - everything was just lovely. The human (imperfect) element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allow a hearty resolution. Alok Nath is such a great actor, so open with the feelings of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves true romance - those who go beyond shallow beauty to true love - as one of the best movies out there, Hindi or otherwise!
