I absolutely love this game to death. Ever since I was 9 years old (I am now 15). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the ultimate awesome kites! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be the hero. At this adventure you will encounter wonderful creatures and forest fighting. You also meet some friends on the road who have their own special element. Like fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also elements known as dragon spirits that allow you to transform into magical creatures of the legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures, you will have to face in this adventure of action-packed tensions and excitement. One of my all-time favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
