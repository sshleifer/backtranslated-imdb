This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States were thinking of the September 11 attacks. This film was expertly composed and presents this disaster as more than an attack on American soil. The aftermath of this disaster has been previewed from many different countries and perspectives. I think this movie should be distributed more widely to this point. It also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than news reports about the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually fun, but not violent so. This movie was highly recommended to me, and I share the same feeling.
