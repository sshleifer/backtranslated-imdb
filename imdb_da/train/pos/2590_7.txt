The people who have poor mouths in this movie are those who do not understand movies at first. These are the people who love movie blockers and negatives for any movie not staring Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a nice little movie that can seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first, but what is lacking in plot means more than content. One thing about the movie that impressed me was the use of music, which plays a big role. The students in film music will see how important music is in the film, both in Vida and Wilders life and in the background. Wilders theme, Vida's theme and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it is fun how some of the lyrics are played. Eg. In the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "She is my girl" and then she goes over to Wallace to give him something when the men sing lyric "She wants to be my girl "shows the tension between the two brothers. There are all sorts of minor complications like this inside the movie, and while it may look like a flop on the outside, the real film student will notice how good this movie is.
