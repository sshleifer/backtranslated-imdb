This film was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at her top (looks wise). In her previous film For Me and My Gal, people often say that she looks exhausted. Well in this movie she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun, especially at the beginning, when trying to arrange an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes is, in my opinion, Judy's rendering of Lady Macbeth, and when John is seeking her at the party to give her a spanking (Lol). One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean one minute he despises her, and the next they go out on a date so next time they meet after the date they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I didn't like was on the opening night. If I were Lily, I'd be furious with John, but she's not ... it just doesn't make sense. But all in all, I would have to give this movie a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect.
