One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that you would otherwise miss. Unless you are a really artistic devotee, you probably won't get many documentaries. Only a handful gets a recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its involvement in documentary films in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Each year, a group presents inmates a Shakespeare game. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the squad, as roles are self-chosen, interpreted, repeated and ultimately performed. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with fascinating revelations to those of us who have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the brands we know of (prison, criminal, killer, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking about people. Serendipitus was the piece chosen for the film year, The Tempest, with its intense focus on forgiveness and redemption. The actors all fight the game's relevance to their lives, find patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary, like a book, the best thing that can be hoped is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation to me. "O brave new world that has such creatures in it."
