Anyone who had never seen anything like the battle scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The battle scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also made the matches in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldier who does not feel pain, now living a life as a pacifist librarian (you have me). When other evil soldiers start killing local drug addicts to take over drug trafficking, Li is standing with his police officer to help stop them. There are some crazy things going on in this movie (a badguy gets his arm over with a glass window and hardly notes). The battles are filled with flying kicks and battles; the body count is far up there. Li has rarely been better and he has surrounded himself with a wealth of beautiful female costars (Yip kicks some serious ass like a co-worker, supersoldier). Anthony Wong himself makes a como as a drug gentleman (no surprises there, he makes a cameo in every HK movie). It's unfortunate that they don't make action movies like this one in the US; I wouldn't have to go through all those horrible copy jobs to see the action that I long for. Recommended.
