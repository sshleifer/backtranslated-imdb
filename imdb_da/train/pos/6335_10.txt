Now I come from Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to get a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie! I don't know exactly how old he was, but he didn't work like a kid (GOOD VALUE)! Now about tornado - it wasn't so realistic, but scared you! If you want a good time in front of the telly - this is the movie!
