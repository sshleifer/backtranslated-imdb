I really think this movie is great, personal. But in every movie there is a downer. Now, some of you may not have seen Hilary Duff's 'Raise Your Voice', but if you think about it, the two shows are very similar if you know what I mean. In 'Brave New Girl', Holly wants to get into the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri will go to a winter garden in L.A. (Don't remember the winter garden name). They are both in the music field, and both must sing at the end of the semester. It's really fun how these two movies are alike. I like 'Brave New Girl' better than, 'Raise Your Voice' though.
