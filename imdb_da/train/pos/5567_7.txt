And I will tell you why: The one who decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very poorly advised. Everything about drugs is cut out and covered !!! How do they do that you can ask? Well, they don't do that well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a blur of marijuana smoke that stones others on the road without any explanation!
