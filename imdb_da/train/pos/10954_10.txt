Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel, and I think I'm in love already. Yes, if you loved Jesus, is Magic, you will love this. If you didn't, what's wrong with you? Kudos to the comedy channel to push this in my face. My life finally has meaning, and "Your car smells like farts" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically, and I'm looking forward to next week. It's like Grease meets South Park. Absolutely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is a person I could look at reading the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and oh so much fun. She never skips a blow. Come to think of it, it's not so much her choice of material. Which are some really good things by the way, as this is the way she chooses to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, comedy channel!
