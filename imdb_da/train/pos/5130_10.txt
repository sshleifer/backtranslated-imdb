... may seem like an overstatement, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What is so hard to understand is - why don't they make more musical shorts like this? Wasn't beauty obvious to anyone involved? I do not think. So many shorts were only for commercial reasons, and luckily there may be some artistic value in there. This is an exception - the only one? - where it seems as if the director had a vision and could clearly appreciate the music as art. Why didn't anyone ever think of shooting Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy man. <br /> <br /> Shame there were no successors. If you have seen something of a similar quality, you can share it!
