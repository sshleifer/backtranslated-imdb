I saw this flick yesterday, and I have to say it's the finest horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Sorry Steckler). The movie is definitely worth finding out if you are a zombie fan. This movie series of soul and atmosphere. Some of the shots from the zombies are the best ever to be committed to filming. VERY eerie-looking dusty webbed slows down slowly to their screaming victims. Brrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot saggy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you busy before HORROR emits its undead body's eating head. This movie was entertained from start to finish. I couldn't ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it was too short.
