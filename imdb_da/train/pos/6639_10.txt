You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> Some of your favorite movies have given you some vocal voices. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And that's all because of this. Fifty Seconds A world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can one not get a ten? I wonder about those who give this a seven or an eight ... how could the first movie ever get better? For the record, the long, still-open shot is a great showmanship, an excellent innovation that perfectly fits the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All this within fifty seconds. The word genius is often overused. <br /> <br /> This is genius.
