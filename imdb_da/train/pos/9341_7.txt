Sandler is great again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This movie is the scary Sandler story. Its expression is amazing. I shouted more to see Click but there are some similar points. Considering the value of the family before it is lost and being able to say 'I love you' are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's hard, it's right ... and actually there is a real owner of this success, binder . I don't think another director could give these feelings in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Don't expect to laugh or very positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to face the realities of life, don't miss this movie.
