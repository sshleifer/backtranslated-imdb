Cliffhanger is what seems to be Slyvester Stallone's last action movie before becoming an underrated actor. It's about a mountaineer to help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases that carry money over $ 100 million. It has a great action sequence, the edge of your seat fun and a good time in the cinema.
