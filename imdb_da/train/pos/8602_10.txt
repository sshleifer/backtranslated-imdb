One used to say about Nathaniel Hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the same remark might fit McDonald-Eddy's pictures. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it has many features of a failed movie: it is kitsch, the script, due to censorship, sounds inconsistent? Still, this movie also gets some good points: Good Rodgers-Hart's music ("I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), well played with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you don't like it, you can't forget it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong, dreamy impression, and it is very likely that you can remember days, perhaps for weeks. Why? In the thirties and early eighties, movies did not have the same means as today: it was like a dream to redirect the public to make it forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream movies that were made at that time, this one is extremely powerful. <br /> In short, let's say the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering if it's good or bad. To see it as if you wanted to see a dream.
