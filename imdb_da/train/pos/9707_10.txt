A year ago I finally gave up on American TV. I was thinking of giving up TV completely until a friend who had lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The Gentlemen League. That was when I decided to switch to British television. Among all the above shows, The Gentleman League is easily the darkest and twisted of them all, giving guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy I've seen yet. Entered characters are the most unhappy couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in the meat that goes invisible (probably for the best), a terrible couple that looks over a local store that only caters to the locals and the worst veterinarian ever. This program is one of the best I've seen.
