My Take: A goofy, but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter are returning as the two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the competing adventure comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted do much more than travel through time. They might as well travel heaven and hell too! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" competition that can make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, for many years in a futuristic civilization, the time guide of the first film (the always visible George Carlin) runs a university praising Bill and Ted's names. There is an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from HUNT FOR RED October) to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical android replicas (with Bill and Ted: Robot Us's words) to do the dirty job. Then Bill and Ted experience death and have to find their way through hell with inhabitants who happen to include the duo's worst memories, and then through the sky in an attempt to get back to earth to save their boyfriends ... and their show. During this whacked-out voyage they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the foreign film school of 1957 THE SEVENTH SEAL, helping the help of a couple of intelligent alien creatures and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY's range of exuberant special effects gimmicks are not up to date standards, and even a bit of humor and for-the-time look and feel somewhat dated (to be honest, the movie also feels as it was released in the wrong year, even in the 90s). But with that is no small lack of imagination and a lively tour of both performances and direction, Bill and Ted's BOGUS JOURNEY are fun, imaginative and yes, false. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
