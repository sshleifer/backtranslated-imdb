First of all, the only reason people keep bitching about this movie is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story that's "changed". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film was also not a perfect reproduction. Good enough ranting. This is a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are beautiful and taken from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle for Helms Deep in Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is top notch, and most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste, but the Aragorn looks AWESOME out. The movie has a fantastic score that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories, but hate reading (the books are even better), this movie gives a try, remembering it was made for 20 odd years ago. <br /> <br /> Also with special attention: Peter Jackson's Fellowship adaptation follows almost as much as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
