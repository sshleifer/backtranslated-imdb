I managed to lose this from my satellite, but I would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states. Eddie is truly brilliant in this show from San Francisco. I can't remember laughing so hard at a stand-up routine. My wife and I both enjoy this bond and his work at Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of his shows available.
