This is Columbo, who was directed by Steven Spielberg at an early stage of his career. It's not something sensational, but some small hints of good things to come to Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The film is largely in the same style as most Spierlberg's 70s film and television works. So that means some characters tend to show some quirkiness and no I don't just talk about the Columbo character alone. The kind of character quirkiness that might best be seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie "Jaws". But apart from some small hints of typical early Spielberg elements, you can't call this movie the work off and good example of a rising director star. Not so bad, of course it is not, but as I said earlier, it is also not too sensational. <br /> <br /> This movie started out very well and very promising, but after it is fine open, as As always happened to the murder, the film became more slow and dull. Boring because it's mostly a Columbo movie in the book that doesn't have real memorable moments in it, not boring because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer who murdered his writing partner showed a great and interesting potential. However, history did not explore all its possibilities. At least that's the feeling this movie left me with. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie was a good thing to see thanks to Jack Cassidy's character who thinks he's smarter than Columbo because of his mystery / crime writing experience and tries to give him all sorts of possible tips leading away from themselves. But of course, Columbo is better and he is his number one suspicion from the first moment, but as usual he plays the game together. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good overall style and uses a nice camera position and editing. It was fun to see it too, most of this was largely in line with Spielberg's later work, especially some of the camera angles. A nice and perfectly visible Columbo movie, but don't let the name Spielberg attach to it raising your expectations of it too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
