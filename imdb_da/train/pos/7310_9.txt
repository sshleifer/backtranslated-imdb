There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best movies ever not only in its genre but also outside. I love the movie's creepy atmosphere as it all could be, this kind of situation makes it scary to think about. Also to imagine if you ever in this situation what would you do. This is a movie I enjoy watching a lot, especially around the Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional director, I love many of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the movie Halloween. And if you're thinking of seeing Rob Zombie remake, then it's not. It's pure crap, and a real Halloween fan would like the John Carpenter version 1978 better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any movie and is a very well-known one.So by any means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.
