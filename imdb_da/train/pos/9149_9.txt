I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy. I wasn't sure I liked him this way. And I wasn't sure he could pull it off. But it forbade me. He shook his back and made me look at street people. The movie is exciting and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he can really play is a good guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a little clumsy, but maybe it's the right people would fight ... If you're a Thomas fan, you should see him here when his best is bad!
