Jim Carrey is good as usual, and although there are a few "Jim Carrey moments", it's certainly not a "Jim Carrey movie". It is targeted mostly at children, and I managed to enjoy it as such film. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who were expecting a wonder over the top comedy were disappointed. The movie has good moments and works well as a movie for children. I can't say I LOVED this movie, but then again I'm not the target audience!
