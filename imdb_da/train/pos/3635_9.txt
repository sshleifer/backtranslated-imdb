This is a great Disney girl.It is the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who was once on his way to the big leagues as a jar, but suffered a career ending injury. But through series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) gets a try with a big league and does the roster himself. It's a great family movie. It's inspiring, but it's not too thick. It's fun and entertaining. as well as kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers took some freedoms to tell the story. Quaid is sensational as a title figure, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy, look no further.9 / 10
