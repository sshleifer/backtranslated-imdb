Yes, it's over the top, yes it's a bit clichéd and yes, Constance Marie is a total treasure and worth seeing over and over again! The jokes and gags may be old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. As it is a family program, humor is dimmed, and the authors have incorporated family values ​​and ideals among the gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is fun. Don't take him seriously and the show is a winner. I am sure he did not intend to be characteristic of his character or a day in virtue. His outbursts and screams of joy are fun ... <br /> <br /> I must say that one big, dark, bitter spot is Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that anytime she is on for more than 30 seconds, I stumble the TV so I don't have to hear her. There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes. As a mother she must be the worst out there, and I'm just shocked and surprised that George as a character would be so excited for so long. <br /> <br /> Even so, at any time I get crossed off to see Benny, I think of myself: seeing her is much better than having to see Bill Engvall Show. Now there's a bad sitcom ...
