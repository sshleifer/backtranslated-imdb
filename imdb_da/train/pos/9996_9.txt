I have not read the other comments on the film, but judging by the average rating I can see, they are unlikely to be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the second time with my kids. They absolutely loved it. It was true that they did not have the adults rolling around on the floor, but the sound of children's enjoyment made it work. <br /> <br /> It's a real Mel Brooks farce with lots of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are and how weak our friends and colleagues are. There are many other films on a similar subject, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. However, it is difficult for me to imagine such an influence on family members. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for the kids, a 9/10 from me.
