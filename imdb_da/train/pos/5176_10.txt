One must watch movies for anyone who ever went to the camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It's fun, it's compassionate that makes you want to see more about the characters when the credits begin to play a role. If you haven't seen this movie ... what are you doing? Get out of here and run the video store. Have a good summer :)
