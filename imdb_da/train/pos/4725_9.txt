Despite the lack of logic present in history, Kill Shot is a very entertaining movie. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien depicts brilliantly the emotional rift between a hardworking affluent father and his wrong son. Each member of the supporting spirit encounters a solid achievement, highlighted by the living Asian man whose name I can't remember. A shocking tragic ending can evade some younger viewers, but overall, Kill Shot really lives dead.
