Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an ulterior motive to meet those who have been behind their tax payments. Thomas caused seven people's death while he was speaking on his phone, and the film follows his efforts to reconcile with his just, unforgivable crime. The story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. What you see is exactly what happens - even the end of the Titanic was more surprising compared to seven pounds. There is absolutely no twist at all, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what happens. <br /> <br /> Normally, I only like Will Smith when in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is best when he plays a gun, drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah", as when trying to act seriously, it's only a pathetic attempt to try to get an Oscar, which he obviously desperately needs. . This is probably the most important reason why I was not looking forward to the movie, even though he is very discreet here. There are flashes of comedy, but they are subtle. In fact, it was the most underrated Will Smith performance I have ever seen, and therefore alone, he was fantastic and ironically, he should be nominated for a great prize. <br /> <br /> The support supports were also great - Rosario Dawson looked good at the death of the whole movie, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as where all the other bit players. All in all, it's a laugh - but it doesn't throw away all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you any choice but to cry. There were a couple of times that even my hardened heart almost broke. You are hard pressed not to find one of the situations that are not related to your own life, which makes it seem more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show moves on drama without the entire desperation of happiness of happiness and comes out better for it.
