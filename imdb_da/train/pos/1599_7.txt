"Moonstruck" is a nice little movie directed by the amazing historian, Norman Jewison (In The Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, Hurricane). The film is good at many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked most about the movie was the relatively unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positive on most of the movie, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little strange. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun movie and easy to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
