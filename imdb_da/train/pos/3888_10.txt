This is definatley one of the best stand-up shows ever. EVER. Eddie is so away from the wall that I have seen this damn show for almost five years now and it still rocks every time. Just everything from his big wide physical comedy down to the little one from the top of the main comments, it's a masterpiece. You don't have to look beyond this line. "The word herb. You say it, and we say herb, it's a f # ## into it." Brilliant.
