I had seen this movie a long time back, but found it amazing, and to this day it has never stopped amazing. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie describing the account of a group of Australian commands that attempted to sink some Japanese ships into the Singapore port at the height of 2. world War. <br /> <br /> These commands are trapped in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the Japanese prisoners. But something that hasn't been explored much in a Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. A close and friendly bond develops between the prisoners and they caught. They start to respect each other, while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friends with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really draws your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day the two friends talk about, the Aussie captain learns that some other prisoners will be tried and executed to sink the Jap ships into Singapore's port. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his team and not some others who had lowered the ships to his Japanese friend, and after hearing it, the Japanese guard says he must stay quiet as it can cause his entire group to be executed. But the captain remains wise to confess this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful way that is consistent with their rules. This is the highest honor given to the captured warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazing part of the movie where the aussie soldiers await their impending death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe why his Aussie friend offered to be guilty. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give up the end here. But it is more exciting than one can imagine and can easily move one to tears. All in all, an excellent underrated movie that might not get the recognition it deserved internationally. Get a copy today and be hypnotized.
