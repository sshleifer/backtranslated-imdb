Before it was lost, everything that was shown on TV was predictable. You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you can predict nothing. All things were so surprisingly amazing, and it really was a mystery, not because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was so good. I was literally dependent on it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. It's genius. The surroundings are brilliant, it is quiet and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a genius work, especially those already on the island. Castaways are so dramatic, but we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say, and they have secrets that affect the other castaways that die with them.
