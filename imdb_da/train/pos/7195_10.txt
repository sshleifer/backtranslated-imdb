I loved this exciting republic of serial! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even tough, the picture quality was not the best, but ok. The fences in this series are also a little bad, but not terrible. They should only have practiced some more. As I said the story is amazing! You're just sitting there waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The music theme is excellent! It's the same guy who girls the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who chops Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and also the legions! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Zorro! He is fun, smart and brave! Brand: 6.
