This is the only full-length feature film about the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that the movie is perfect for describing professional bridge players and how they go about making money. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very fun. I don't think a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really beautiful, the sham is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media is portrayed is completely hilarious. There is no way on the ground bridge, ever will be like that. <br /> <br /> See it as soon as possible and tell your friends.
