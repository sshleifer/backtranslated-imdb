Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were very fond of and respected in their small town Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Instead of unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the case to the conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a point of contact for criminal writers to this day. The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real places, it has a little documentary quality, ice cold and detached - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the movie on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests and deserves it. As killer Perry Smith, Blake captures you between a deep taste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; It is a masterful achievement from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less nice. As Capote's book opens the movie with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's home - only to suddenly flash past crime to detail the study, which finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The film's centerpiece has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in Clutter's home; actually filmed in the Clutter House itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrible and deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks controls the film with a very strong sense of reflection, only fails in the sense that he allows the film to become a little preachy. However, given the overall power of the film, it becomes a trivial irritation. Strong stuff - and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer
