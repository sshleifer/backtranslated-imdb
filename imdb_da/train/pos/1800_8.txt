All dogs go to heaven are on par with the Watership Down for scary kiddies movie. Both were dark and rather scary, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the young age of about five or six, I admit ... I was in love with a cartoon dog. All dogs tell the dark story of lovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story begins with Charlie fleeing the death row and swaggering to the nearest club to do some game. Of course, as a child I did not understand the concept of this movie. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I got older I wonder why I was not disturbed by this movie as a young. It's about pretty adult themes --- games, murders, hell and prison, but in a world of good-good Disney movies it's something every child should see once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some crazy transvestite crocodile scene and hell scenes scare me more now when I was a kid, but it delivers such an exciting message that should not be ignored by parents!
