Walter Matthau and George Burns work just as well together. Willy's acidity with the confused Amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene, when they meet again in Willy's apartment, is a gem and the final scene of the scroll film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as the irascible half-retired comedian, whom he can only, the intonation of the voice and the exaggerated drama combined with his general misconception about what is going on, form a great characterization. George Burn's timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this movie, his quiet aplomb with desert dry responses is memorable. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask about the Spanish caretaker and Al's reaction - invaluable.
