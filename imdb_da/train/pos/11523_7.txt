This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I saw it on DVD, and the disc has no special features or even a menu, but it is not necessarily what I care about. <br /> <br /> I usually judge movies on a case-by-case basis, depending on, among other things, whether it is a large studio production or a smaller movie. This is a smaller movie, and I'm willing to forgive smaller things. That said, I think it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences I've seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed acting from all the big players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character exhibited by Claire Forlani may come across unrealistic for some people, but I have personally known real people with emotional problems who very easily look at life's decisions as her character does. It helped me retrieve the nuances where her evil could come out through her mood veneer. This is not a movie for children, of course, but it does NOT engage in free sex and nudity. There are, however, some adult languages, but sometimes it can be very fun. (Especially Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear properly.) <br /> <br /> Also look at cameos from well-known character actors.
