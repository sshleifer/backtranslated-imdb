If you want to see a movie of different kinds if you feel the love of your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally disabled, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love gives you directions, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my faith. The foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough advertising to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, almost with similar taste.
