An underestimated addition to the Graham Greene movie gun - its perceived error can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, theatrical director, hits his action with a repressive stiffness appropriate to the material, and the apparently inert compositions clearly indicate discomfort. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 40's thriller!) If the film has an upright hero that becomes sour and murderous (and possibly pedophilia), brilliantly brings the distant ideologies of the Spanish civil war into an appallingly dangerous reality, has a horrible murder, an astounding insight into the class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approach of Greene's God and an end that is only happy if you do not know the story.
