As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one plays alongside the rivals of the plotters. For some reason - oh it is explained! - She's chosen to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba Good guys and bad fighting for the mine and who's getting confusing. But as always, Powell's dance is excellent and worth the price of admission. And in this player Lahr's swept lion and evokes warm memories of the 1939 Technicolor movie. A fringe remuneration belongs to a young frank, with the wonderful voice and lean vulnerability he left for his wise man later. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time to show his virtuosity. Look especially at his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpeter, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" perhaps in ignorance, but I don't know about any other drum / trumpet sequence like this on movies or records. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's goofy persona is relatively limited. Powell once again shows that she is the greatest film dancer ever.
