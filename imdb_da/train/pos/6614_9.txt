I read that it was not good that the story is not solid, Volckman feels that he has failed somehow. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First, it is well done. Volckman does well not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: would immortality reduce the value of life? Big Question ... <br /> <br /> I can see he's trying hard to build a feeling and he's not compromising. This must be applauded. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. I have seen artists reduce a form to a minimum to build the intensity of a moment. I identify this movie with this. Moreover, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoping, and Volckman's history is more important than Linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many more stories out there with lots of gaps in those who do much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
