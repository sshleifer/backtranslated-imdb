The most moving and true eye-opening documentary ever created. I shouted all the way through, from start to finish. When you look at the show, you are immediately caught by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we ​​would take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to understand that I was living in pain every day of my life every year. I really felt for him. The shameful part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses his coffin. Can you imagine doing it? Even more, even though he was in unpleasant and unbearable pain, he still opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only ones who deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, which sand and undeniable he was!
