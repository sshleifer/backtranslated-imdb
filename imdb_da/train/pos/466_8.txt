This was a very good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic influence as his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive love Natalia. Relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by Gorris and well-known Nabokov sensations as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita") are evident in this film. I think I will now continue reading the novel. It was a touching and tragic ending, and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
