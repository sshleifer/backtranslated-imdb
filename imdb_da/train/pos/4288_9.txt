Rain or shine outside, you go into a movie house. It makes you happy. (If not, just come out.) The lights go out. You sit down with a bar ice cream. Moving images starts to flicker on the screen. You feel satisfied. In the dark you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown, turning and turning the scenario with the rest of your clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not satisfied with themselves should not comment. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
