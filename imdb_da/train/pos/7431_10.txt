I am and was very much entertained by the movie. It was my very first film in 1976. Be raised in the 70s, I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson's appearance and behavior, of course I am no film critic, but at the moment it is very good. I look very much like the combo Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as Esther and John Norman. I'm a very big fan of Kris and see him in concert when I can. What a talented singer sang author, not to mention actor. I've seen him in many movies, but still thinking back to a star born.
