This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it is not about dieting, it is about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose it. Beth was a very precise sign and in the scene where she confronted her mother with the eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she feels. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth shouts the words: "It's not about you." to his mother. These words were so true and added so much to the scene in the movie. I think that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
