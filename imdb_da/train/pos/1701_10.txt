This is a thinking man's stupid movie. If you're not expecting Star Wars and enjoying British humor, this can just be a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and I - from cary "Cary Grants and Jack Nicholson" voting as martyrs to the overly simplistic population of Big Bean This is a movie that you can either sleep or look carefully and enjoy in both ways. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing light humor that takes a quick mind to watch joke as it slips off you, you will enjoy this movie.
