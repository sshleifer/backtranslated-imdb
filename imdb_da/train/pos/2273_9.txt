I haven't yet seen a movie with Nolte in what I didn't like. But that's said, he has made a lot of movies, and I've seen a few. In my eye I increase the pictures of his performance here and there in "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of actors. When it is necessary to shout, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those I treasure in actors: when he just resists through facial, hand and body limitations without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors largely have no understanding of what an actor can do without speaking without conscious recognition of the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation builds of actors too much on mechanical wizardry of computers. Of course, it's also just a sign of the times we live in. Had Chaplin lived in our times .... who knows he might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the Vonnegut short story from which this movie comes on the screen. However, the plot is not so far fetched or decayed that we cannot follow the path, even with all its surprises. Of course, at first it seems to be confusing at first. But that is not impossible either. Consider these for starters: A spy in the heart of the third kingdom: The extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America's most important spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (look at Amazon for more details). Consider: History Undercover: Piercing the Reich: American Spions Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I saw this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a story channel production . <br /> <br /> So is the story ridiculous? By far, yes, impossible, no. Back to the ground. Nolte character is recruited and accepts an impossible dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us enough reason to accept it. Was it a kind of inaction that he was sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he'd ever written and he got to play that part? It's hard to imagine any of us understanding. But it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things. The action of the entire film of the entire cast is excellent, and as people have pointed out Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked at the end of the movie (no - I won't spoil it) and it made me feel terrible about the election. Did this person find that the road was finally over and that he had spoken everything that was needed and that more chapters would be added to a life that was already filled with many burnt pages? It's hard to say, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Nolte offers one of the finest performances you can expect .... the movie's premises make you wonder about many things. It is very entertaining and provocative. What good movies should be. A bit long but worth it. By the way, the film music has choices from one of the best live composers: Arvo Part.
