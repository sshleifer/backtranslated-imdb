Overall, the movie is ok. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that make me touch. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> But the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really' 'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' ". <br /> <br /> I love the song. Me Quitte Pas "and" Hujan. I just downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And greet Yasmin. The movie's end credit makes me touch again. We can see how Yasmin really appreciated his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the movie deserves the Grand Prix of International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.
