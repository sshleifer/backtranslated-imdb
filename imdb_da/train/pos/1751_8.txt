The 40-year-old virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronic store and does not have much social life and is very awkward about women. Some of his colleagues in the store invite him out one night, and they find that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the store Andy meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number and finally Andy, works enough courage to go on a date with her, and they start to like each other, but Andy is still very awkward When it comes to sex and he has to tell this to Trish, much to his shame if he can actually come up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward. The 40-year-old virgin has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances of the whole role, good film and good movie editing. The movie stars are co-written by Steve Carell, who makes a very good comedy breakthrough performance and his writing to the movie is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is sweet, fun, entertaining, fun, fun, wise, good natural and a good time. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen for a while. The 40-year-old virgin really shows a lot of talent and it is used well and it seems like a comedy and a romance, and it is sweet and very fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
