It's hard to see this movie without thinking about the TV show it would be, especially if you like the TV show more like the TV show. But there is much to say about the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top New York City sports writer living in an eight-bedroom apartment alone, a divorce fraud and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) who needs a place to live after his wife threw him out of his stubborn neatnik mindset. The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage game. <br /> <br /> First thing is first: I love that opportunity! Poker table, novelty dart board, askew photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a few Roman bars. It is a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks are doing a good job opening the stage game's single set, Oscar's living room, by moving the action into the bedrooms and the kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to jump out. <br /> <br /> Neal Hefti's well-known score was heard on the TV show, but never as wrongly orchestrated as it is here in several events that make the screen's action floating when played. Real-place work and night shooting in Manhattan gives the film an energy that is common to movies shot at the time and place ("Buddwing", "The World of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Manchurian Candidate," "Rosemary's Baby "etc. <br /> <br /> Is Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film is thought to be a more serious affair dealing with the then unusual state of divorce and the frustration of not being able to work together. Simon has more to think about than joining Felix and Oscar in a "Password" game or a wits game at Howard Cosell. But I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were great comedians, I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this movie, which I often do in their separate films, but I never understood why they were considered a great comedy team. Here, in their best-respected partnership, they seem to work in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy drama and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is fantastic in the beginning and charms us with his teddy bear demeanor around the poker table, but at the end of the movie he takes a trip like Jack Torrance in "The Shining", which responds to Felix, cleans up his apartment and serves tasty food to his friends in a way that completely disrupts the delicate balance of blame. <br /> <br /> As the end bothers me, the part many see as the most devastating, beginning, works fine as I see it. Seeing Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself is not a big comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a big comedy and set us up with some pain in reality before we get the heat and latteret. (Plus it has some amazing pictures of the city.) In the middle of the film, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it acts as a way of establishing Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and fejd. <br /> <br /> This is where Simon's lines are so big. They are the film's underlying strength. He gets the bias exactly right and right, and still makes it fun. "I don't care to speak, Felix. You have things to say. What scares me is, I'm starting to listen." The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume that the film is always better. In fact, the TV show has once made a good point of "assuming" something, but the film creates a solid foundation and is a joy in itself.
