The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in the music and the dance. As I am older, I have become more interested in the play as well. While the first half is only a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still entertaining to see. The "Badder" sequence could have been omitted even though the kids were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when police say to Michael, "I need your autograph right here" after stopping him to dance in a no-dancing zone. But it's "Smooth Criminal" that is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as hesitation (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect, and it is also the special effects. The only thing I could have done without was spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this if you don't already have it. I give it a 10+!
