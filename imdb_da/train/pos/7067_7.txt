Although a little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars in the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a perky personality and a highly admired operative song voice. This 1937 was her first major movie, and it turned out to be a box office bonanza for besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS relate to three daughters from a divorced couple urgent to their invisible father when they are still faithful mother reveal that he is soon reusable - with the firm intention to undermine his gold digger boyfriend and return him to their mother. Although the story is small, the script is witty and the expert group plays it with a nice scrubbing coil. Durbin has a pleasant voice and appealing personality, and such quirky character actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer round off the cast. An ultralight pleasure for fans of the 1930s movie. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
