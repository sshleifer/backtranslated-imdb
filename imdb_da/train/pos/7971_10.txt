This is a great movie for all ages. It is the story of three animals, how to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist in the end and mostly in the whole movie. You never know what will happen next time. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don't know what to do next time. The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. The producers also spent a lot of money on this movie and it also shows. The animals in this movie were well-educated and are great actors / actress themselves. Everything about this movie is amazing! 10 out of 10 all the way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee that you will love what the whole family wants!
