"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky, a modest philistine who lives in Paris, who responds to an ad for an apartment, only to find out what the former tenant was trying to suicide by jumping from the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital, and he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and is initially very pleased to have found such a nice apartment. His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors who seem to try to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the former tenant's suicide. This movie is great. Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Lots of brilliant moments like the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the former tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall or fever's dream, where he walks into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered in hieroglyphics. Sven Nykvist photography is really beautiful. "Tenant" is a neglected gem. It can be difficult to track, but it is more than worth doing.
