Always enjoy Drew Barrymore's amazing plays and her amazing performance in this movie, playing a very complicated young gal, (Holly Gooding), "Skiped Parts," 2000, leaving New York and traveling to California and sharing an apartment with a upcoming author, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things begin to happen to Holly, and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after killing his father. If you look closely enough you will actually see Drew Barrymore's mother in fact appear as her mother in this picture. If it wasn't for the great play by Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween Night! However, it certainly has the surprises at the end !!!!
