I have also gone through very painful personal loss (twice) and this film portrays the bad skewed reality of that experience. Life is unbalanced, nothing makes sense, well-meaning relatives, etc. .. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Ally again. She is one of my favorite movie actors all the time. <br /> <br /> I was laughing and crying as the story unfolded. Fantastic history and cast. Well done!
