I watched this movie tonight in NYC at Landmark Sunshine. I didn't know what to expect, I wouldn't read much about it as I knew I would see it, no matter what. All in all, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "Anti-War" statements that left me out of it. The soldiers talked primarily about their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp, and how difficult it was when they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell about the difficulties of surviving not only the war but denying the command to go back when it was against personal morality. Don't make a mistake - it's not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it is, has not seen it or lives with the war years on their souls.
