I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 at the time, and now at age 22 it feels strange to have seen this cult program start and end and look back on it. The 90s all suddenly seem so far away, which big decade. Still, I used to watch MonsterVision all the time, as I am a big fan of monster flicks and horror movies. It was like the 90's version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs why not Joe Bob's show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. A lot of Joe Bob's comments and info on the movies was just fun. Most of the films shown on the show were B- or C-quality, but it showed many A-house movies as well as the hammer movies from England, which are Top notch as well as many with Ray Harryhausen's stop motion majesty. Many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the Japanese Sci-Fi movies besides of course Godzilla, known for almost all and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of movie preservation and more independent minded directors, I think MonsterVision would be a great show for IFC to pick up as they have already hit the IFC Gatehouse show. I'm sure this show will be retrieved again for nostalgia reasons one day, I think, must wait and see. Until then, "it's big TV"!
