Before the Tuscan sky, I saw Diane Lane's excellent performance in this otherwise lark of a movie. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as adults. Each of those returning seems to be looking for something they lose, making it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of a sign all her clothes were wet "this is so camp!" From the practical jokes and fighting over lovers, to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it is amp. When exciting activities now seem secular. An amazing ensemble cast makes the best of one-two-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs Brad Paisley (probably when he first fell for her !!) The beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) and a comic book turn by noted director Sam Raimi make this one movie you can pull out over and over again like looking up an old friend.
