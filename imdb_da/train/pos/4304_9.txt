I remember watching this movie when I was about 7; and at that time it shocked me. I had seen a violent film before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti-Asian bias) and to get it from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon came upon things from such a crude and genuine perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than a crash. Especially when comparing the endings. The end of a collapse is this supposedly nice little end that ties everything together. While the Grand Canyon simply ends with a silent note where you know nothing, much will change in the character's life, but that's because life just goes on, there is no appropriate ending. No matter how good ... bad you are. There is no end to a chapter to start another.
