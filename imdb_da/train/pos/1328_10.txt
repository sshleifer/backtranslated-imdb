Without "mental anachronism", this movie, which I would like to find on DVD, will offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of the people's thought before "world pains". That thirty years, an instructor and scenario writer can test such empathy and such a romantic truth to make it from them masterpiece leaves me amazing. It would be necessary to be able to see and rethink that film to better intervene than the temporal and cultural distances to lose the capacity to be included / understood, analyzed and finally accept such or an example of "primitive thought". Because this thought, which maintains almost impossible to feel in the secular world, however, contains certain keys to our behavior, only those future generations can analyze with sufficient relevance. If anyone knows where I then get a numeric copy or VHS for me or DVD ?? Thanks in advance.
