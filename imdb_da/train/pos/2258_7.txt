I think Sarafina is a huge effort for Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film, and her role is less than the title character, Sarafina. When I work in a high school with city children, I think this is an important film showing the South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and a teacher relationship with her students, Sarafina. I bought the video for almost nothing on a video store. I saw it and sent it quickly through the songs. But I strongly recommend this movie to teachers and their students to understand. Now that I don't know the other actors and actresses in the movie, I suppose they are very popular in South Africa, and I'm glad they filmed with a South African cast and crew except Goldberg in a small role, but if It makes people see this movie than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.
