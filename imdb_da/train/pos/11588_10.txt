This movie was great and I want to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. The boy must feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed to the crops. The boy rescues the eagle from being killed and running away from the trunk. The ear helps feed him by catching a duck in a small pond, and the boy frightens. Later, a boy shoots a deer, which a bullying child claimed, because their arrows were marked very closely. Only when they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually has the deer. But it was unfortunate because it made the other boys even more cruel to him, and eventually he was hunted up on a rock, but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle, he turns him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was. Please know where to buy this movie, let me know. I haven't seen it for over 30 years, but still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
