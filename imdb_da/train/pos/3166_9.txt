This show has come so far. Only ALL in the cast from Eric to Fez were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces and just seeing what they were doing. They stuck to the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and that's probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end, but if they finish this show, I hope in God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest battles a season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the last episode. Go down swinging, get a last punch. The view deserves it, fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know it's going to end, as if friends, and let the final be huge. I say that Donna and Eric get married, I say that Hyde and Kelso are fighting and becoming friends again, I say that something interesting happens between Fez and Jackie, because Fez has tried so long, but of course it won't work for him. Just close the BIG TIME GUYS SERIES! <br /> <br /> The 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you as friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
