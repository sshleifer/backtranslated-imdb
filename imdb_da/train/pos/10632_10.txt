This is a movie for entertainment; I didn't think the world made social comments from a small movie. I personally find this movie fun, obedient and memorable. It's a fantasy, not unlike a cinder girl being a princess. This film was made really good, I could add, in the 70s, a time with the best experiments in film to name a person's sexuality. This film is not about the fact that a person is gay or not, but it is about love, in all, strange forms. This movie shows some of the reality of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood or in California. Beautiful boys are watched by older not so beautiful men. Women who had to remain deeply locked in emotional creation or the risk of not having a career. Bathhouses were an integral part of homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Then the imagination begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some spirits and what do we have? Reach this movie, which was somehow better than the grim revolution "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the entire crew to watch this movie and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now. I heartily advise anyone who wants a fun, tender movie - to curl up with some popcorn and have fun. Some people have to look up !!! And this is the movie you have to do with! <br /> <br />
