I found it very interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and the members of the origin, ie. Chinese. It becomes a story of values ​​and makes the viewer reassess their own choices in life and loyalty to the institutions. Incredibly enough, this succeeded in a gentle, mildly humorous way, which only looks backward on its status quo. I enjoyed the movie and would see it again if I could.
