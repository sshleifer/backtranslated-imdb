*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would. However, this film is still excellent. It had tons of surprises and it gave a little more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss was a killer, the general feeling I felt was happy.
