After Fatih Akin's first work "Im July", which was pretty good, he created a really beautiful Italian family epic. It's a German movie, which unfortunately is a bad condition because we produce more than moderate films;). But this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany in the 60s. The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellently drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Well, you just don't believe him in the role. But the character is well-balanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style with this movie with the "Godfather" style. Many people will probably hate this movie, it says boring. Not much excitement? - Yes, but a monstrous movie. 9 out of 10
