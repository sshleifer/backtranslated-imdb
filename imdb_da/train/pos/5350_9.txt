I have seen The Running Man several times since I am a Stephen King fan and have all his films, but now it is even better because I didn't know about this site until 2 days ago and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser who was involved in this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grow up on Starsky and Hutch TV show. For me, this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch was injured. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so hard. My father had to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a child aged 12. Now I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and all that Stephen King has his hands on, I'm so there !!!!!!!! Just to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
