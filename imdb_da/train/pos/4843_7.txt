In fact, this is one of the movies you should give 7.5 for. The fact is; As already mentioned, it is very fun. Wonderfully atmospheric. Askey actually comes across as over the top, but it's a good vehicle for him, like Oh, Mr Porter is for Will Hay. If you like old dark house movies and trains, then this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Oddly, it's the kind of movie you want to see over and over again. It is friendly and charming in an inviting way with all the nostalgic references that made a great war price. The 'odd' band of characters simply play each other as they do in many other typical British war-time games. It would have been great to have watched this movie if it had been recorded by Ealing Studios. A real shame that the 1931 original has not survived intact
