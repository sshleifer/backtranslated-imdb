"Dick Tracy" is one of our family favorites - the actors are amazing - the art direction is extraordinary - the music is magical. It's not supposed to be "killing a mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Earlier or Later" is just right, "What can you lose" is hunting - even tunes like "Live Alone and Like It" add to the story <br /> <br /> Got to love Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, who supports villains ... The list is too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. Written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, "Wait a moment - I have a thought - it's gone!"). <br /> <br /> But, one of the most narrative things in this movie is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time - and that especially adds to the enjoyment of the viewer. So if you don't already have it, why not give "Dick Tracy" a chance - accept it for what it is - a Sunday cartoon brought to life - and in a wonderful way !!
