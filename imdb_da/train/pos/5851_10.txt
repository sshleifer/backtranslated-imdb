* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is just the second pay-per-view I've given a perfect 10, the first being 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, just once fun. And so I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening image between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga vs. Marty Jannetty were the only low points. They were OK matches, but DiBiase deserved better in his last pay-per-match match. These days, a battle like this would have run-ins and a bigger climax for Razor's first big babyface push. And Jannetty, fresh from an Intercontinental title round, could have had a better match with Borga. But I don't think anyone really cared about it. They just needed a Borga push on pay-per-view television. <br /> <br /> The IRS and The Kid were great, like Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels is down for no one. Notice how he subsequently left the WWF so he didn't have to work for Razor. Bret Hart had two big brawls with Doink (note how everyone's best match is against the Hit man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; That's why this year's feast of the year was a no-brainer. How often do you see two legends win the Feud of the Year so late in their career? The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Who knew the bodies could hold themselves against one of the best teams ever? <br /> <br /> Many say the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez fight was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember what made the old WWF (as in before-WWE) great was the mix of athletic and freak show. Is there a soul out there who didn't like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event wasn't bad, though nowhere near the status of the year. They made Lex Luger good, but made a wise choice in having Yokozuna hold the belt. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham held the belt for more than two months. Today heels are masters all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF through the WWF in the 90s, if you blinked, you missed out on a healty government. <br /> <br /> As an old school break fan, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
