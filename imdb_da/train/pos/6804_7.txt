Don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and seeing this Romy Schneider classic. This film was shot in a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to make a constitution. For example, England is portrayed as adjacent to Germany. A will of wisp Victoria and her mother take a holiday to Germany with buggy ride alone. They arrived their too fast. This could probably not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she is told she is a queen, does she go to the royal room, where the court members bow to her, where are the British citizens from the castle cheering for their new queen? Why doesn't she show herself on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where the audience is so aware of this imperfection? I wonder how the critics felt? Durring the inn scene, she meets Prince Albert, but is not fond of it. Durring the meeting in the diner's side of your inn, you hear music from famous old American Civil War songs like "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe". What? Civil War songs in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where's Mammy? Does Magna Shnieder also play her? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well this add to the camp. It's inadvertently satirizing Queen Victoria's history. This is the only reason why you should pick it up or see the 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
