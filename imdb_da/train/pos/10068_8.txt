This movie was excellent. A sad truth to how culture tends to collide with the sexes. This is just a great hot fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind heart in his own way, Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his feelings, and you choose it with a sweet monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is equal to great happy movie in the end. This film does a good job of showing how traditional you can be, so permeated that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see pages of a culture that has never been seen before, helping to improve the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. Biographical photography is excellent, especially the open parade sequence of all sparks. Tied to being in Oscar's claim for best foreign film.
