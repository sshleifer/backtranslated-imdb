I liked this movie and am concerned about the rating some people have given it. It's a cartoon based movie, and it's animated, now if you don't like cartoons or animation then you won't like this movie, so why do you and bother judging it is beyond me. Even if you are a fan of interesting, powerful characters and heroic (sexy) women who kick ass and save the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought the story really penetrated me and it was a very cool movie. Completely anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. Meet is the live action version of the Punisher. Finally, I highly recommend this movie, the comic buff and super hero fan or someone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.
