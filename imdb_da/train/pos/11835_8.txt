While I wanted to watch this movie since the first time I saw the trailer, I was in for a deep surprise with this movie. While some of the elements and actions of the elements seemed a bit like "cartoonish," the dark nature of the movie is really a very different experience. Instead of the emotional joy story, this movie takes you in a different direction, which turns out to be uplifting, but also disturbing. Most children do not understand some of the darker moments in the movie, making this movie more accessible to adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tiles. The musical score was once again solid, showing that Hans Zimmer is going to the guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I'd say I actually enjoyed Brian Adams music.
