I came home late one night and switched on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarize their choices this week. I didn't hear anything about "Red Rock West" except two thumbs up and see it before it went away. It would not stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better. <br /> <br /> Next afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, it was some of the funniest I've ever had in the cinema. As some readers point out, there are a few plot holes, and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's well worth it, for the fine craftsmanship that went into the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be completely cast. Dennis Hopper almost goes over the top, which gets stupid, but strengthens how well everything else works. The sets and music contribute a lot to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented it later for my family, it didn't work either. The long scenes that built the excitement of the theater were difficult to appreciate, with the distractions at home. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, watch and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
