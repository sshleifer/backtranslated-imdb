I must say that this television movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to watching her in a sitcom now, and I really hope a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH is shining in a drama. Seen as we have seen her at Sabrina now for 5 years now and so to give viewers a taste of her very unused talent would be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in what wants her parents to "get rid of" so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers want to see, Melissa works with David Lascher in this before taking the role of Josh at Sabrina. So it would be nice to see this at the moment when it is sent again. Hopefully, MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in several television films, such as Kellie Martin, who has always shone in television films. Lots of unused talent waiting to break out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
