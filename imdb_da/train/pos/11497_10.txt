This is one of the very few movies out there that are very erotic without being pornographic, despite the fact that there is only a very rudimentary plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; instead, the actors make voice-overs describing their experience, why they participated, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a document. <br /> <br /> It's mindset. <br /> <br /> I can fully understand why nobody else has ever tried to do something like this. There is already something like this. This. :-) <br /> <br /> Note: The manufacturer is not entitled to distribute a DVD version. I have never seen it being sold anywhere; you can send mr. Boerner and order a copy at VHS.
