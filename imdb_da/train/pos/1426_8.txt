I have to say that sometimes "appearance" is all that matters, just as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC has pointed out (not about our land, but he is right anyway). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to looks, this movie is such an amazingly amazing beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are seeing. <br /> <br /> There is also personality in the movie, interesting, with a captivating narrative and tells stories that touch your soul as you watch the superfilmed pictures. The movie may not affect your lifestyle, destroy these beauties, but it will definitely remember how precious our land we live on. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic land documentaries I really enjoyed.
