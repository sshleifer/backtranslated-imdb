This is a powerful documentary on house abuse in Cameroon. The "sisters" are lawyers and judges who successfully prosecuted husbands in 2004 for the abuse of their spouses and won a woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is quite long - about two hours - but fascinating both for the individual claimants and the defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in the courtroom that was rendered by female judges. It will leave you as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change happened. Where and when did women come to occupy government positions in Cameroon? Have the multiple cases mentioned in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women in general by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against a man's express wishes, a one-off event? I do not suggest that the filmmakers could have answered these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a wide audience.
