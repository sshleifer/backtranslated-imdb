Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life that drives. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), are trying to survive on the streets by being little time artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive car park while Curly will scream for lawsuits and traction for the intended victim. It happens to be a very exclusive lawyer called Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done. Not only do scammers make some money, they will stay overnight at Grey's plush apartment. Nevertheless, Gray feels that she owes them more so the three hang together to spell. Gray knows only the lucrative law firm and nothing about life. Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, the knowledgeable experts on the realities of life? But all good things must end, and there is no life for a legal expert and a few king people. Or is there? This is a cute and fun movie about the unexpected. The curl is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but much more edgier, of course. Belushi gives a rare touching performance as it is down to his luck, and Lynch is shining as the snooty but soft touch lawyer. John Hughes, as author and instructor, shows us his magic touch again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray for one night without money and see the humorous results. Are you longing for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your movie that is made to order.
