Go see this movie for the beautiful picture of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and indulge in a thorough eye-opening and relaxing experience. The music fits perfectly with the recordings, but never gives attention to itself. Some commentators called interviews with the artist a weak point, but consider this: Why do you want to expand this in a movie if you can read Andy's musings furthest in his books or participate in one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more suitable for showing the ephemerality of the artist's work, and it is used academically in this regard.
