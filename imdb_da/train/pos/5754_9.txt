I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters round because they left an impression in my mind that lasted a long time after the film's end. And the end, now it's sad, good ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie again lately and found that the plot was too simple, two-dimensional ... I think it's the kind of movie you can only do with the innocence of a young child ... Shame ... I recommend this to all your parents with small children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can't tell you whether the translation is good or not.)
