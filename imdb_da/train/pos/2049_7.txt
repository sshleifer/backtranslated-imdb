This movie is rather cheesy, but I give it credit for at least trying to give some characterizations to its principles. There are some good moments in the movie, and the dialogue has some good moments as well. <br /> <br /> The antenna impact sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how long a veteran will go to a fellow veteran. Sure it isn't all that well done, but the premise is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
