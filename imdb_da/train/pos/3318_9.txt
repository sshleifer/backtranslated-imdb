A very cute movie with a fantastic backdrop from the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ball players and real references to previous Bosox errors. And how fun was watching a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving Kevin Costner trying to get believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a fine job as a young beloved couple suffering from Jimmy's Bosox jones. It was a little whacky and out of the left, but there are really Sox fans who are the fanatic and live their lives through the happiness of their beloved team. The movie shrank along at a fast pace, and the end, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular films without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> Also fun was Willie Garson's return to the screen. I miss the ever popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. He is always fun even when he does or says very little. <br /> <br /> Buy yourself two boxing seats, some popcorn and get ready for a fun time. "Fever pitch" is a winner.
