William Powell is a doctor who deals with a murder and a former wife in "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" who also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost every woman with whom he was with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen saver, the actor made a few other "Thin Man" -type movies, one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both for very good effect. <br /> <br /> Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty, debonair professional and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The former wife. B has Mr. B served with a courtesy for the detention and then moves back to help him solve a mystery that she has withdrawn. And that's not the first time she's done it! It seems like there was a "Bradford" movie before this or that this was supposed to be the first of a series of movies - Mr. B complains that his mystery-writer ex constantly brings him to cases. This time a jockey falls on the favorite horse in a raising mystery out of the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution of the case is a bit outgoing, but it is next to the point. The point is the bias between the couple and the disturbance of ex-wife. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in his role and a lot of fun. But with an actress coming out as good as Arthur does, humor seems to be intentional rather than featherbrained. I suspect the author had something else in mind - says the bad side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "Oh, it's enough about my alimony. I've been waiting for the police to take care of it," it's more of a Powell's rib rather than a serious statement. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can do a part of himself. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing as William Powell and Jean Arthur were always.
