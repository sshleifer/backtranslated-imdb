When scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts the invitation to work Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) for a large modern house in the corporate connection. They meet with their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family fully adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt, telling him that each member of the club has a meteoric professional ascent in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. Later he is introduced to the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who turns to Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels changed in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club and find a bad secret about Jessica and its members. In the 80s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked this movie that is partly reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives", where people change behavior in a suburban relationship. I just saw it today and I found a great metaphorical message to the big companies when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher wages. I'm not sure if the author intended to give that interpretation to the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
