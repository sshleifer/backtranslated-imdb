If you are the kind of person looking for a realistic movie or one with a strong and credible plot, then this movie is NOT for you. No - you want it. But for those who like sweet, slightly scrubbing comedies, then you will have a good time watching this little movie. Tony Randall works for the IRS and he examines a very nice farmer who has never understood he needs to file an income tax. But he is trying to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is excited about having company. They pulled him on and treated him as one of the family ... and plans to get him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. It really is about all the plot that is. But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting. A really nice little curio from the late 1950s.
