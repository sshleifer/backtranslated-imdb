The infinite limits of our inhumanity to our own kind never fail to fail me. This truly amazing story of a horribly abused and largely unheard-of population is convincing, well-documented and outrageous. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behavior, and this is just another in our long catalog of international settlement. We suck This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason I only gave the 8 film to this movie, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the terrible cooperation between the US and British governments, requiring us viewers / citizens to be complicated in our own action. .. but gives no suggestion on how to help. I don't know about Britain, but America made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in their government's actions. A gesture in the right direction can help the cause of these islands.
