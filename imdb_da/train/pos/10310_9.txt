Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I saw this movie. I mean what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey Playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is hardly sacred, but neither is it sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the power of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feels very unsuccessful in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell from bats that they love each other, but the relationship is on rather shaky ground. <br /> <br /> Bruce gets a shot at the anchorman, only to get the entertaining stolen by Evan Baxter. Of course not, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television in a way that is comical and certainly worth getting him fired. <p> Many people complain and grab God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this very entertaining. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is the electrician, and Jesus Christ is the watchman. Think about it. Manager, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything going. Janitor, the guy who clears the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Still, Bruce is a little skeptical about meeting God, but when God gives Bruce his strength and gives him a shot to play God, he begins to believe a little. I wonder why. Enter the fluttering violation of power for personal gain and abuse the enemies. As this is Hollywood, Bruce finally breaks himself up, learns his lesson, and begins to use his strength for the best of the world. Eventually, he cries out to God to take it away and pray that his will be done, not Bruce's. <br /> <br /> As it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite entertaining and there are certainly some very entertaining moments in it. The film is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the movie can be quite thoughtful and even challenging, and I welcome Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this movie. <br /> <br /> So far from perfect, definitely an entertaining popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)
