I've spent the last week watching John Cassavetes movies - starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending in 'opening night'. I am completely and completely blown away, especially of these two films. From the first minute to the end in 'opening night' I was completely and completely absorbed. I only experienced it by a couple of times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted from about two thirds in, all the way to the credits came up. Everything about this movie, from the way it was shot, Gena Rowland's incredible achievements, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the deep sense, the pace, the tenderness, the originality, the characters, the tiny moments .... for me, is really sublime. I couldn't agree with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the depth of this movie is something to see. If you are unlucky enough to get a house fire, I guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to save the wallet under your bed, you will save your copy of this movie instead.
