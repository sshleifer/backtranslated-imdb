One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but it's nice anyway ... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members when they have seen this movie repeatedly and are infinitely citing: "It's a divine beautiful day, now it just keeps you up? "The open explanation of Little Eie's costume only promises that the movie will continue forever, and so will Big Edie" The World Famous Singer "and Little Edie" The World Famous Dancer. "
