I went into this expecting not to like it; I figured it would be terribly dignified and serious, and rather plodding and boring. It's actually far better than that, and I found myself really enjoying it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most people know - married to Albert, who died young, and she ever cared for him. Seeing the circumstances she grew up in was fascinating; In fact, I found myself wanting to see more of the story, and I imagine we might see a sequel at some point. <br/> <br /> Visually, the movie is stunning. The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too exciting and over the top. The action is top notch from everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In one word, it was amazing!
