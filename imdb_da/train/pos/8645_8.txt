I had seen this movie many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, I have hardened many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'California' when I look again recently. I am pleased to say that it is as unpleasant and enticing as it was ten or so years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this movie its power. The first is its cast. We have a staggering disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt like Early Grace. Knowing that Pitt, as we all do, as one of the most enduring hearts that Hollywood has ever had, is refreshing to see him play such a silly, unattractive character. Pitt pulls the show without resorting to scrap metal or parody and manages to stay really scary throughout the film. Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace's tragic boyfriend, playing the character of a decade-old girl with a forty-year-old life experience. Lewis manages to awaken compassion (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she supports her performance with that kind of ease, rarely seen by an actor so young. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any prizes for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who inadvertently end up traveling across the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is adequately geeky and naive, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and cloaked, but both actors are convincing to portray the changes of their people as they are just as fascinated, rejected, and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> Fine casting and uniformly brilliant behavior, this film really takes us from the famous balls through its flawless pacing. At that time, "California" was released, Hollywood released a bunch of nice character-out-to-psychotic films ("Single White Female," "Pacific Heights," "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle," "Deceived," "Sleeping" with the enemy 'etc.). Most of these films followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy. 'California' is not really a scam too far away from this area, but the first two actions are the perfect example of the slow-boil thriller and we are kept on the edge of our seats waiting for the tide. /> <br /> When the penny falls and Pitt is loose to play the stupid bad guy, the movie shifts completely and the last twenty minutes do not quite live up to the rest of the movie. That said, the action is thick and fast, and the solution is well-chilled. The battle is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the story (provided by a somewhat whiny, pre-X-files Duchovony) is a bit distinct. Of course, it is supposed to be from the book written by the Duchy's journalist character so that one could argue that the self-conscious narrative is supposed to be a key to the kind of sensational style most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film is largely a success and is certainly an average of over 90% of the thrills in the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak in the stomach or mind. This movie is disturbing at more than one level. But then it is supposed to be.
