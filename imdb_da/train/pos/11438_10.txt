Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own country, get duped to be ignorant farmers of Synanomess Botch. Twice At a time, the story of them, the signs they meet and their struggle to put things right. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice performed by some of the best in the industry, this eerie movie hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process, while resembling that of the carved "South Park" style, is much smoother and far more dimensional. If I didn't know that the animation was this style, I would swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! You will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more from the experience!
