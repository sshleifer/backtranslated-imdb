I love all the movies from Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr's casting of Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" couldn't have been better. Dale Midkiff has ways to draw on this character. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me spellbound from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The death death of Missie & Willie with Clark's timing visit was only God's timing. How they treated death, and how Clark helped them do it, was for a father's love. Although there are 3 movies before this [love comes soft, loves lasting promise and loves long journey] I feel you can watch this movie and understand it easily. But leaving and wanting to see the previous 3 movies because of the story, are all the characters behind them. Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent instructor <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
