A long-term prison, shut down for over 20 years, re-opened, and Ethan Sharpe (the late great character actor Lane Smith), once a guard there, is set aside. As the prisoners are set to fix the place, they are instructed to break into the old execution room. This releases a violent spirit that brings merciless chaos to both guards and prisoners; cool-as-can-be-bound Burke (Viggo Mortensen, who shows true poise in an early role) is involved in the hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's a no-brainer to praise film for its atmosphere (it was shot in an actual abandoned penalty near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror movie to a higher level. It has a great sense of vanity established from the beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth management effort here; It made him "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" directing concert and effectively started an impressive career in mainstream action movies, thrillers and horror movies. <br /> <br /> It may have stock ratings, but it has a solid cast Chelsea Field as the young woman giving way to the prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as tired veteran judges Cresus, Tom Everett as restless cone Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as the extroverted Lasagne, Tommy "Tiny" lists as soft-talking giant Little, and Arlen Dean Snyder as captain Horton. It is also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder (as the avenged spirit) who helped * him * land the recording of playing Jason Voorhees in the "Friday the 13th" series. <br /> <br /> Decent special effects moody lighting with legal genre film photographer Mac Ahlberg, the creepy music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, stunning images, the incredibly gloomy location and an overall flashy and intense presentation help make it totally entertaining. It is uncomfortable, cruel and fun for a scary fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
