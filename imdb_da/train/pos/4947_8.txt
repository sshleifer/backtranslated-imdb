One can only hope that there are many times when such a powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. It all comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I didn't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what do you dislike? The smile of her can melt diamonds. She's just so great that I can see something she's in. The same goes for Freeman. He is just magical on the screen. <br /> <br /> The two gave us a movie that was fun from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to the Packy. It was tender, charming and simply fun. <br /> <br /> Check this out.
