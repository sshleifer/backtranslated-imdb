Classified R for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest and most original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal Tap. It's a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a movie. If you manage to find this movie, don't hesitate to buy it, even if you don't like rap music. There aren't too many comedy movies that I give a perfect 10/10 to. The only ones I can think of at the moment are this movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture. The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who makes a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a rap group that makes many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy movie and I recommend it myself if you are not a fan of gangsta rap scene. It's a shame that this movie is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
