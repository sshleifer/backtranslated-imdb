Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of the true and reality view of his usual themes and chooses a depressing take on Tokyo slum. Kurosawa stretches for a style that, in my opinion, was his antithesis - that is, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu image. Poorly paced, poorly conceived, this movie is a rare dud in this author's body of excellent work. While Ikiru was entertaining and depressing, it was still interesting and well-paced, and while Stray Dog portrayed the slum and social poverty in Japan without being too heavy or boring, unfortunately, it has all the gloom you could expect with its content, with none of the redeeming qualities of previous Kurosawa images. Be warned, this is not a movie that Kurosawa must judge.
