Having seen several movies from Villaronga, I had a pretty clear sense of him - he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters and forgets a rhythm of the movie. That is why even though he has good critics, his film has never received the general public's attention. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly, I slept through the first part because the first part provides the necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless, the other part is absolutely fantastic and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
