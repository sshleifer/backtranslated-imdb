Many reviews here explain the story and the characters "Opening Night" in detail so I will not. I just want to add my comment that I think the movie is a wonderful confirmation of life. In the beginning, Myrtle Gordon remembers how easy it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been, and even if she can even continue to live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovered the power of her art and restored herself ("I'll bury that bastard," she says of contributing Maurice as she walks on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's instructor prevents people from helping her when she comes hopelessly drunk to her first performance. He does, however, know that she must have it herself if she has to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary break on Myrtle's downward road. I think this really is her "opening night" - she opens up as a flower for new opportunities for life and action, she sees a way forward. It goes tremendously. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is amazing. The movie is amazing. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.
