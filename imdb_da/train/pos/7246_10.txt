This movie is absolutely ridiculous. Not only is the plot terrible, but the play is terrible. The special effects are asinine, and the entire film is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Nevertheless, it is by far the most entertaining movie ever authorized to be produced. It's 101 minutes of laughs because of the fact that we all know there won't be fuel in the year 3000 or any El Camino. There are also other aspects that I will not spoil just because they are what makes the movies so wonderful moron. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its complete idioci. I have no idea who would see this, expect it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, see the Exterminators 3000 of the year!
