This would have been my first movie this year for 1991, unless it was knocked out by the brilliant JFK. It's such a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where different characters' lives intersect and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is marred by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I never have much like Martin or his style, but here he is fantastic. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. The script was excellent. Larry Kasdan is the IMO, a great dialogue writer, following the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he has formed several three-dimensional characters and thought-through stories and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. A truly outstanding movie. 4 out of 4 stars
