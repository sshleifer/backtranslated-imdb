This movie is a great way for the series to end eventually. Peter (the boy from puppet master III) has grown up and is now the puppet master. Well, this girl is going to destroy the dolls and learn Toulon's secrets, but instead she listens to the story of the dolls. Most of this movie is recordings from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Puppet Master's Curse and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I think Paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made, but the way this movie ends, they pretty much say "This is the final movie in the series ..."
