I just bought the DVD and I must say (after seeing Brazil and fearing a disgust in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of Monty Python movies, Terry Gilliam's genius follows through in this sci-fi thriller, which Bruce Willis plays a tremendous role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played insane Jefferey Goines. One must have for sci fi fans, or a movie fan of every kind really, because it contains excitement, drama, action, etc. <br /> in any way plotted, in the future, 1% of the world's population will Survive a disease that intends to wipe out humanity, which was previously released by the "Twelve Apes Army". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was released) to find out the disease, so researchers can find a cure at the time. Before moving on, James Cole lives in an underground community, and the animals control the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill humans. Anyway, when he is sent back in time, he is actually sent back to 1990, when he is sent to a mental institution because of his stories to the people of the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is later responsible for destroying humanity. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe), who eventually joins Bruce to save the world (as she sees him being correct in his stories), sent him back and forth from his time to the past and finally sent to 1996 where he then puts his own beauty, but later pulls through to reveal a thrilling final block of the movie and later builds up the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and instead shot by the police as the killer comes away.
