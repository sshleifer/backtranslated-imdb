Claire Denis' debut is both brave and confident. In this depiction of life at the end of the French colonial Cameroon, she examines the relationship between men and women, black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the film's primary purpose of desire and repression, the film enters the taboo area from the beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer attached to the screen. The voice of the film is recorded perfectly by the camera work and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> A good discourse.
