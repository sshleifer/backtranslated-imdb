Just like the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely considered to have been groundbreaking (certainly "widespread" extensively and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian movie by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And yes, I actually think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Thoroughly credible and perhaps even more enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, who I suppose we will see much more in future features. But I have to admit that I most enjoyed the lovely trip by Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor Mr. Theopolis, who mainly plays a willingly animated version of Victor Van Dort from Corpse Bride (or for those who have watched the movie, would not be reading even better here like Corpse Pride?) And of course Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least animated, yet profound, role as the titular character. Just believe he would not have got this role if it hadn't been for Peter Stormer's commitments to prison breaks (as revealed in Q&A following Thursday night screening). I can't help but wonder that the writers must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'. I'm not keen to reveal plot details under a comment, and I'm not starting now. Suffice it to say that Fido is not one of those graphic gory Zombie movies you can trust from Romero. Rather, it is a movie that will keep you constantly chuckling, and though (and I have to think carefully to be sure) there is a fair amount of bloodshed and violence, the wonderful humor so well enhanced by the surrealistic environment created by Director Currie and his writers, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that should be rated PG-13. I urge you to see this little Canuck gem. I will definitely buy the DVD when hopefully next summer.
