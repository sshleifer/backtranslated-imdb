I thought this was a great way to spend time on an overly hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy. The reason is simplified, but the dialogue is witty and the characters like (even the wellbread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully controlling the style many of us have grown to love. <br /> <br /> This was most I laughed at one of Woody's comedies this year (dare I say a decade?). While I have never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, here she managed to tone down her "sexy" image and jumped straight into an average but excited young woman. This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was more than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy to see with friends.
