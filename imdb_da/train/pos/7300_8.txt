Like the gentle giants who make up the last half of this movie's title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it is also slow and thought-provoking. The producer's last excursion, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow succeeded. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was the passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wonderful worlds beneath the ocean. But even that was only acceptable. Poor focus in some scenes made the production amateurish. With dolphins and whales, the technology is all wasted. Shooting scenes and too many close-ups of the movie's huge subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's amazing 3D capabilities. There are too few scenes of any depth or variation. Close-ups of these amazing creatures just look flat, and there is often only one being in the camera area, so there is no deep contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week on cable, his introspective and boring treatment of his subject is a constant disappointment.
