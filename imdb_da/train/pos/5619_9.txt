I once lived with a roommate who tried suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so of course I can relate to Polanski's "The Tenant." <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the movie for other reasons. I am not sure that it seems as a whole - the descent of the Polanski sign in paranoia and madness, which takes up in the last half hour or so, seems quite scary and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was totally unconvinced, and he hit the movie with a vicious one-star review. But I think the individual scenes and moments seem beautiful, so even though I don't quite understand the whole movie - what does Egyptology have to do with it? - I still have a generally positive impression of it. <br /> <br /> For example, I love the unpleasant friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson. God, how many times have I settled down to have stupid friends like that instead of no friends! I love the cinema scene - the funniest "make out" moment in the film's story, I would say. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so foxy in this movie, it's almost incredible. And she gives a good performance as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with occasional inappropriate remarks about his performance here. His character must be key and thoughtful so that his turnkey performance fits. For one, I found him quite sympathetic - even though he lost me a bit when he started dressing in a row without any obvious distinction. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is unclear. And slowly. But it captures the alienating qualities of the living house - something I have done far too much of - so I dig it. It's fun, all you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply important! Definitely worth picking up for pocket changes on DVD.
