Unfortunately, this movie has never made it to DVD. I saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983, and then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently watched a VHS copy in a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, it is obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to see. But then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about many things. It's about how the World Bank and the big companies exploit and enslave the developing countries with their capitalist arrangements to force them into a debt they can never repay. It's about how our economic system takes advantage of us by forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that we may never have had, and maybe we can't really save. It is about good and evil and about how difficult it is to tell one from another. It raises many questions, but does not provide answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, this is a movie, really worth saving and watching.
