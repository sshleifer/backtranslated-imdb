This movie is a very relaxed, romantic comedy that is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as Albert Einstein, genius niece, although she believes in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she enters her shop with her fiance after her car is finished. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing mood while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if it is possible, it happens here). Personally, I found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - I thought they were fab and fun! This movie seems to have been underestimated without understanding. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
