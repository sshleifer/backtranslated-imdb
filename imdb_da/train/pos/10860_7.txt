It's not as fierce as I expected, making the violent scenes even more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are many twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing throughout the film making it difficult to know who has a particular character. <br /> <br /> The reason is pacey with a good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting picture of the work of the Triad gang. The violence that comes is brutal, no weapons or martial arts scenes with special effects. It is credible in your violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed to forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and credible.
