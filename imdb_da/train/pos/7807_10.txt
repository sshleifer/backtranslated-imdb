The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is superbly NATURAL, which is what the film play should be; and the steering ability is handled so brilliantly on every detail that I am never tired of seeing it again and again. However, I am surprised to see that this movie is not included in some of the actors and director Attenborough's credits that puzzle me: aren't they proud to claim that they've made such an excellent, long-lasting movie to the audience? I hope I will get some answers to my puzzles from one (possibly one of the "knowledgeable" staff (insider) of the movie).
