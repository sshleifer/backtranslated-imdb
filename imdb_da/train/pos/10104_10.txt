The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes along nicely with the minimalist approach to storytelling and the direction of Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also good. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen another movie like this. It's a whole, every piece fits so well into the plot. You can't be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes out as the bossy man and "baap" in Om Puri. About Puri, the young man is trapped between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the real touch on the movie with his smiling and soft talking villain. The first meeting with Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty in Sadhashiv's place is amazing. Smit Patil does not play a major role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add to this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has come to terms with the system and its work. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to stay away from problems. He is also 'Guru' about Om Puri and helps him when he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty, but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. About Puri catches hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this extraordinary performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.
