I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect for exploring, first and foremost, the emotional experiences of the people involved, and secondly, as another wrote in a comment, the implications of this kind of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... initially with the second aspect ... to make it short, it was not at all visible ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. as I said, it had much more potential ... I think these kinds of relationships have much more excitement ... much more excitement ... and the potential excitement doesn't come through ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack could have been more than the few songs on the background and the theme (which was nice, but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel the lack of a better soundtrack .. the actors ... i think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in the main moments ... <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 ... mostly for the story
