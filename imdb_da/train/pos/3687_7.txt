Greetings again from the dark. 18 leaders of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes of love in the city of light. A very unusual format that takes a few segments to adapt as a viewer. We are so used to character development during a 2-hour movie, it is a bit of rehab to occur in an 8-minute segment. The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city. Of course, some stand out better than others, and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many well-known faces also feature appearances: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and the nerdy but happy young son of the two mimes. Also playing key roles is a red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, child's death and many other issues. Don't miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the segment makes this interesting to see, but as a movie it cannot be described as good. Nevertheless, it is very reliable and a good change in the pace of the frequent film grille.
