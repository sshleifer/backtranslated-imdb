This movie was excellent, a little scary but excellent on it. For those of you who have heard of columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the back of your mind, you know people are thinking of these things, but you never realize how bad it is, and this movie makes you aware of it. It's serious as well. It also makes you think twice before you get the fun of someone who is safe. I read a book about the columbine massacre and it made me think, this movie makes me worried and scares me to death. On the downside, it is like one how to kill any guide to serial killers. I recently received a threat and I blew it without thinking about anything, but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are insane, and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and not under the guise of anyone.
