I remember this movie from many years ago. Definitely the best movie on the subject in my experience. The fact that I very much remember so much of the film after such a long time testifies to its influence. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performance due to the language barrier. But they were nevertheless very powerful. <br /> <br /> This topic continues to fascinate ourselves over the years. And it was most effectively dealt with here, with the right share of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I wish it would appear on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there any art file that gets a copy of it?
