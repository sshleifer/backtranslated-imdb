I've lost count of how many reviews I've written on Slaughter High. I have read many bad and I will say right now it's a great movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well-known suicide, and although it was his only film, he made it so great. First, I didn't know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I found out because of the current website at www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life certainly had their strength and weaknesses. He did a well-functioning job that might disagree? I always wondered how he felt himself naked in a movie. Must have been quite embarrassing to say the least. I first saw this movie when I was 12 in sixth grade. I agree with some pointers that the girl would not bathe after someone was murdered and that high school did not have a bathtub! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star to have a dignified working talent, and unfortunately for Simon's death he made no future films. The cause of his suicide is a mystery, and hopefully it will be discovered in the near future. By doing the math on his website, he tells you that he was 29 when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror movie that is made. Probably because of their horrible acting, the others did not fame in the film industry. -Jacob Young
