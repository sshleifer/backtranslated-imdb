This movie is amazing. If you enjoy watching movies in B-class then it is. This is a classic college 80's slasher movie where a song is played throughout the soundtrack. A horrible movie, but worth renting to have fun or just to see old men jumping out of cupboards with knives. Just fun if you ask me.
