A brilliant chess player participates in a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. In itself, it would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So there's more. It is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance in the game, and there is some story that demands the player. <br /> <br /> This movie goes back and forth from romantic passion to tournament tensions to historic events that shaped the chess player and seems pretty neat. It is easy to grow attached to the two main characters and it is easy to believe that they might strike it together as they do in this movie. The added effect of the tournament is also very good and creates a good voltage setting. <br /> <br /> I have no idea the strength of the chess players since I don't play the game myself, but it looks good and trustworthy. All in all, most of the film goes down very easily. It is also forgotten very easily though. So it's nice to see, but no more than that. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a smoke and a hard place
