I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little bit back and since then I have looked at all his movies that come on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even looks like Owen something) that just oozes the screen. I feel confident that if he lands some fleshy roles, he'll break an Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> It's not breaking down this movie at all. <br /> <br /> It's a great story with very trustworthy people (well, it's based on the author's early shenanigans with rocket launch), a great cast ?? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ?? with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and the great soundtrack with so many rock n roll oldies to get your feet tapping. <br /> <br /> But this movie had a very special meaning to me: In 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Just as he looked up at the night stars to see Sputnik, as it shot over the variety; As Homer also experimented with rocket launch in my backyard and even used the exact same chemicals for fuel; and as Homer, I also had most of my attempts in an explosive disaster! How fun it was ... <br /> <br /> I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights. But that's what you find out when you watch this movie. Of course, it's a basic family movie, but it's a dying race these days, it seems. Take the time to see it with the kids: you all have very good laughs.
