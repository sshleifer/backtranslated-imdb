Some of the recognized Altman masterpieces now seem more sad. Maybe it's me. As the last reviewer, I also like this "small" Altman (recently shown at FMC), although I don't think he was targeting a wide audience. Organizational policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of this satirical "docudrama" is now dated, as Dick Cavett sees on the Tonight Show, but I found much of the dialogue fun and insightful (eg, "You're too real. That means you're not a threat to anyone"). The story is not "profound", but I liked it. And the performances are fun, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as the leftist ideologue (in the opening scene, someone dressed as carrot on politics sanctuary) and Carol Burnett as a basket. All in the impenetrable Altman style, though perhaps not quite as infinite as usual. But rather infinite.
