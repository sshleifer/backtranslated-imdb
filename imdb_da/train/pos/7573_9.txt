One of the most frightening gaming experiences ever made you keep the lights next to your bed. Great story with a romantic, horrible and ironic plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a surprise for a recurring character! Not to mention that voice-acting has drastically improved over the previous series. Don't miss the best of the series.
