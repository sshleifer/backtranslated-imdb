Since Education Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves is visible with her feminine side is magnificent. I would never have thought her character in the hands of a small actress, but Walters pulls it off with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the male management.
