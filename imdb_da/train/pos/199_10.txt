I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them my favorite is this movie (it may not be the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed at myself because the movie was so gosh-darn sweet and well-made. Marion Davies appeared with this movie, she had really great talent and was not just the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story entails a hick from Georgia who comes to Hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! Her experiences and the interesting cameos of the era stars make this a great experience for movie fans and a must-see!
