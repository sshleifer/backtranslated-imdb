De Palma's technique had hit its high maturity at the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, but unfortunately, the history that many of the writings De Palma himself has written serves the metaphor more than interests for an emotional compelling story. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a CRAZY scene where Angie Dickinson masturbates in a bath while looking at her husband. She gets so gripped and raped while his husband stands immensely close - and it's all revealed to be Angie's imagination, as he thoughtlessly removes man's powder from her in bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead call to Harry Potter, who ends with a joke that "she will tell Grandma that he is playing with his peter." She then goes to her treatment session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses and she is hurt and feels uncomfortable and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then a bravura 22-minute almost wordless sequence begins, perhaps the highlight of the movie. Among the many things De Palma retrieved from Hitchcock, the understanding of movies is a purely visual medium for telling stories ?? and in the typical De Palma mode he makes it a way to showcase his formidable skill. The problem for me is that in this case, one begins to feel that scenes become unnecessarily long-lasting just to showcase the instructor's skills. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum. She sees strangers, all involved in sexual or family activity, and then begins to turn on a man sitting next to her. De Palma tells an extremely complicated story without a single word about Angie's attraction, embarrassment, retreat and finally to find and send to the stranger behind a taxi, all for a wonderful lush score by Pino Donaggio who also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie has slept with the guy and stands up to return to his husband. Throughout De Palma says a ton of story without a word of dialogue, when Angie realizes she doesn't have her panties that her husband is already at home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she's probably got a friendly illness, and that she lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. It's all very admirable, but you start to feel a little excited, as we have to do things like taking a long elevator ride from the 7th floor and then up again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... from here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. The woman chops off to her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a wonderful slow-motion sequence when Nancy enters the elevator, Angie approaches her, and the killer's knife is kept ready to cut Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying shots as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror in elevators. It's all good, and in the time we have a dialogue again, you think; "Woah, it was just 22 minutes of pure visual story!" Or maybe you don't, but I do. A younger Dennis Franz has a great role as a sleazy and tough New York detective, who would like everyone else to do his job for him. He interviews Michael Caine, which makes the monstrous implication (though it goes as usual) that Angie would be killed. Angie's son is there too, and he is related to Nancy, and they set out to spy on Caines therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again, there is a strong tie for a Hitchcock movie, in this case Psycho (like Obsession is a rework of Vertigo). You have a woman we need to understand, secretly is a nap that is killed in the first 30 minutes in a closed room, in this case a lift instead of a bath. Then, deceased relatives conduct a study revealing that the killer is a man who dress like a woman to kill. De Palma even throws a doctor at the end, explaining the psychology of the whole matter. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time, a viewer can start to feel a little shaken, and it's my primary reservation for this movie. It is absolutely important to see and show some of De Palma's greatest sets, but the sense that history runs a solid third behind the need for De Palma to appear, and his somewhat indecent sexual fantasies make it difficult to look back on this with wholehearted devotion. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my site for bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
