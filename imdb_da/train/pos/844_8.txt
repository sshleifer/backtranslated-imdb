A chance meets between a salesman and a hitman both changes their lives. This is a weird movie that works, an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard. In a bold youthful role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hitman who begins to strap under the stress of his job, but cannot connect emotionally to anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is as good as the seller, a decent guy with a vacuum in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious wife. Mostly a character study is the film's rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
