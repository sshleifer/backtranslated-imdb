The soprano (now preparing for the end) is the height of television and drama. When the Sopranos hit the mark, it really hits the mark. Using good writing and good actors (most of them are extras from Goodfellas), the series looks high in a satisfactorily unpredictable and unusual way. The title of the cast is James Gandolfini, who for all intensive purposes is Tony Sopran and Edie Falco, who certainly keep themselves. The series also boasts a large collection of regulars to push the plot along with all necessary means (usually violence and spooky language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are good secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal extras are also worth mentioning names like Steve Buscemi (great!), Joe Pantoliano (great!), David Proval (well), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Soprano is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia communities, which despite the rare bad story lines manage to be unique TV. Symbolism and simple stories, dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create conflicting stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect HBO package.
