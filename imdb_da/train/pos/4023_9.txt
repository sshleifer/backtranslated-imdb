This is a very suitable movie. The acting, script and camera work are all first-rate. The music is also good, although it is mostly early in the movie when things are still relatively happy. There are no really superstars in the cast, although several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to see because there's no good end to a situation it presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims against each other and then separating them into two countries. There are some advantages in this view, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to confuse each other as they did at the time of the partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between religions and were wise enough to exploit them to their own end. The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and it is very uncomfortable to remember and look at the screen. But it is never painted as a black and white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope of change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There is the redemption of some kind of last time when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has destroyed her life but also really loved her, and her family who has served her comes later after her. But at that time she has no opportunity that is without great pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film bears the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their serious flaws and that both can be worthy and caring people. The reality of the partition makes this realization more skewed, since there can never be a genuine reconciliation across the border between India and Pakistan. In that sense, it corresponds to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> Finally, we were delighted to have seen the movie even though the decision was heartbreaking. If Britain and the United States could handle their own stories of racism with this kind of honesty, they would surely be better.
