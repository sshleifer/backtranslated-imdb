Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a senior mobster who turns to police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low level who frequent a pool hall and spends his spare time envying Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to jail ... where they are a bond that may not be friendship, but it will do for now. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see an alternative name is "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony" which would have helped sell the movie more effectively. I suppose it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I saw it shortly after another Italian crime film, "Violent Professionals", and I have to say the two complement each other very well. The Italians have always been behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a shame for this movie. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie that unfairly demages it into a b-movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suppose. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and the actors) better than average and unlike "violent professionals" the plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like movies or crime in Mafia movies you should give this a try. A movie about the mob that is actually from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) Is as much as you can ask. Sure, it's not "The Godfather", but it shouldn't be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy action companion movie ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the evil guys. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie made me want to check out other movies from the director and principle. Films in addition to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult films. What is more fun than discovering a lost classic?
