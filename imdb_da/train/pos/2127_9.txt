Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate, but today misleading. The genre has, unfortunately, deteriorated in clich√©s, focused on getting the main couple together and with very little room for mood and other stories, making it formal and overly predictable. Shop around the Corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognizable medium / eastern European atmosphere and has a strong role beyond the (also strong) nominal leader; I avoid using the words "support cast" such as Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) plays a central role for the film, and his story is just as important as the romance. The 1998 film You've got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous penpals' idea from this movie and has therefore been billed as a remake. This is not correct and indeed unfair for the new movie - it shares the genre and lends a plotement, but that's all.
