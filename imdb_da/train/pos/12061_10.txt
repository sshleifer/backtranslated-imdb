Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made, and one becomes completely confused by its sheer shine. This is no less than a diamond !! This is a movie brimful of annoyance, chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror movies all the time! And of course, it probably contains the simplest, flat out scary sequence in the whole horror story! Every time I watch the movie and it goes up to the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be scared of my habits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right and I find myself terrorized as the first time I saw it !! Now it must be said to scare a horrified horror fan like that, it is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud to behave, they do not need any special effect to convey the atmosphere, they rely on the power of the powerful story and the scary (in this case) of suggestions and expectation. Each element is impeccable, from the pieces, the play, the story, the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran could surely make the devil cheek, that's for sure !! As a final note, if for some demented reason you don't like this piece of insanity, you honestly don't know what the horror is about, and honestly don't deserve to know it either. Thank you!
