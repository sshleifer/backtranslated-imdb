This is one of the most guilty movies ever! <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but still enjoy watching her make her room "like super cool" with a "like bitchin" belt and hold onto rhinestones on her face. <br /> <br /> Yet, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that hold your interest. I know the beginning draws, especially if you know what to do, but the other half is probably one of the most nerve-wracking segments of a family movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't stand in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie, actually it's pretty embarrassing though, but I admit this with the internet hiding behind. <br /> <br />
