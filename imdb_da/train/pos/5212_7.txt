STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> A particularly bad actor comes by on his ( now faded) appearance Instead of a highly dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always had a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a safe game in leading male roles that still have a remarkable presence today. But today he seems to have settled more in this kind directly into DVD / limited release roles and as such it may seem more settled in his forte now. He is going to draw on some stern material here like hardened, cynical case officer Earl Babbage, such a worker awarded a few hundred sex offenders in an area in the United States, who, along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes), must go to his latest case and dispel in the kidnapping of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a cause he swept years ago. <br /> <br /> This is a particular dive into the darker side of humanity, stepping on material, certainly not for squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such, it is a fairly strong and compelling film, incomplete and not limited by it directly to the DVD budget. The only thing that really pulls it back is the overly used jittery, fast cut camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a little corny after a while. But it is still some of the strongest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly darkening and more over the edge as it continues. ***
