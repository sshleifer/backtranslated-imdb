Paul Greengrass finally saved the best Bourne for the last time! I've heard many people complain about them, how he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera's style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it wasn't that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes feel more realistic as I prefer highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I haven't even noticed. <br /> <br /> You can tell that Damon has really been comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it is a really good thing. He really gets Jason Bourne at this rate. Damon also has a large supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is full of big cargo and nonstop action, it managed to hold on to character development in theirs with everything going on. This movie is far above the two other Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies in the 2007 Summer Season!
