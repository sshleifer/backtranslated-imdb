In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, generally just doing the things you might expect, like going to football matches to cheer on the national team as it is in the process of qualifying for the World Cup. Except that women do not have to go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> An often funny little movie follows the small group of women caught, slipping into the football stage and the small group bored of soldiers assigned to keep them in a hold pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer on the team (no subversion there), and small human touches on everybody's life add a good comment to humanity in relation to the ideology. <br /> <br /> Amateur play, good script and dialogue, a really fun movie. Bend it like Beckham, a kind - a warm heart and a joy in everyday interests and pleasures.
