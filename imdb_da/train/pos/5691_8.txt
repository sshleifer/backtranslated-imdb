I was very interested in watching this movie when it first appeared in the theaters, but I couldn't get around to it. Then finally hit it on the shelves and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I plopped the DVD into the player, settled in an evening of murder and pressured games. What followed was one of the more engaging flicks I've seen in the last couple of years. <br /> <br /> * AS SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Wonderland killings that led to the seediest parts of LA and just to the biggest pornstars in the 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the start and the movie felt all the way to the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation. Apart from a few blood-stained walls at the beginning and the actual expulsion of the murders towards the end, the film was more or less an engaging show of great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer all but sell me as a junkie porn star, and even the "beautiful but that is it". Bosworth was a pleasure to see (and just for her look, think of you) <br /> <br /> I felt myself the best aspect of the movie was as I mentioned, the lack of direct show murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you couldn't quite see the brutal bludgeoning assigned to the sleeping foursome. Moreover, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to make my appetite better. They beat with lead pipes, there is not much more to be said. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was Carrie Fisher's brief appearance. Her portrayal of the exaggerated religious figure was, in my opinion, a little too clich√© for her appearance. Perhaps that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason Fisher seemed a little too "akward" in her depiction. All in all, an excellent movie worth seeing even though! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
