I liked Antz, but loved "A Bug's Life". The animation that was put into this paid out. I would definitely get it on DVD. By the way, Disney has to make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I've heard talk of squishing all the characters into the screen of standard video format). Most people have to agree that the final credits were the funniest! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can't see the other one!
