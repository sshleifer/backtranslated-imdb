This is a gem, a true piece of Americana for all this implies. If you're self-programmed to resist "life-afirming" stories, just stay away and leave the joy of the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the frost on the cake really nice is that it is fact based on a real filler for wealth history, no need to nit-pick which details were changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors, and the complex, self-confined bottom line good to the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by a person with his skill and insight. The simple minded comments that refuse to accept a father trying to put the law up feeling that he might be out of the way postpone the commentator's limitation, not the authors or the actor. This is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.
