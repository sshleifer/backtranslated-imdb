I didn't expect to be so influenced by this movie depicting a family like the one you would expect to live next door. They are common meat-and-blood people, not like the typical Hollywood fare. They face an all too common problem - debilitating disease. But the story takes hold of the heart with a strong lesson. Casting, scripting, direction, and acting flow along with a wave that draws the viewer deep into history. Give this movie your full attention and its message will really inspire.
