Have you ever, in your life, gone out for a sports activity, tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it, where for a short moment you got the chance to be a hero and a master and. . . Failed? I think many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is the prerequisite for the movie "The Best of Times". In this story, a middle-aged banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), from the deep melancholy of a football error that happened years ago, is inspired to resume the game. . again. To achieve this, he must convince the once-great football game, Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to come back. For Reno, who is happy with his current party in life, there is no reason to change the previous record that gets better as he age. Added to both their problem is actually the years have passed and in addition, both are marriages floundering and in need of re-vamping. Not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) often reminds him of the biggest fall. Nevertheless, Dundee is persistent and will do everything possible to try to correct the biggest blunder in his life. Fun for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
