I didn't know what this movie was before I read about it in L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. The movie stars Molly Parks (from my favorite TV show Deadwood) and Luke's Hare - which I suppose we will see more of in the near future. The movie is fun, heart-warming, has great plays and beautiful photography. I don't know if the movie has distribution, but I hope it does - or will soon. This is intended to be a true indie gem. it even has music from my favorite band of silver lakes! The only disappointment was that the molly parks were not there at the screening. even without her there ... it was the hands of the best movie I saw at the festival.
