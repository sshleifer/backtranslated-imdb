When this movie first came out in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to watch this movie, which wasn't much more than an expanded music video. The action was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians appearing on the big screen for the first time? Despite that, it was still a very entertaining movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton sometimes give classical comedy, especially their rendition of "The Password", which makes you think of Abbott & Costello who make their "who's at first" baseball routine. Appolina (who went by a single name then) gave some beautiful breasts so you had the short nudity covered. Plus, she is very attractive. And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded. The prince later had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this point in his career he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a big category, but it is quite entertaining.
