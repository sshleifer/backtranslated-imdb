Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! Anton Mordrid has been on the ground for 100 years and is waiting for Kabal, an evil wizard, to come so he can kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all of Kabal's tricks. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit confusing in the beginning, but soon you feel part of the action. I will not give up at the end, so go see Doctor Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the movie to be very entertaining because it doesn't have much violence or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and that's what I like! I find the best movies are those where times seem to fly by. That's because you're so confused in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastic movie! I give it a 20 out of 10. Worth seeing! <br /> <br />
