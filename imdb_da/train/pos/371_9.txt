I remember as this movie was up to the Academy Awards and didn't win in any category. For my life I can't remember what it was against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me a bit. It is mainly about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she grows up from a girl to a woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and awful, but all are needed to see how much this woman has put on. Along the way we see other women who have had to cope with their hardships and go with them for redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives his best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should also have been nominated at least for his role in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanly, not as some sideshow, freak shows as the newer "beloved" did. I urge anyone of any breed to watch this movie. 9.10
