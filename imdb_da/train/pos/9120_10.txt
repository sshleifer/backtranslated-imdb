This film speaks a universal language; You can relate to the self, society, society or the wider world. It has a way of not only opening up multiple issues but also striving to discover and ask the right questions to get to the point of self-assertion / ownership. The depiction of the stereotypes in the film deals with the archetypes around us, which must be recognized as the repeated cycle of destruction, the opposite force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors that interfere with the natural flow of things must be made clear and tackled. The idea is definitely a movie to be experienced and not only seen as it drains in one's inner voice / conscience through the look, it makes one feel unlike mere seeing.
