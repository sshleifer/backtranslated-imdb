I think The Sopranos is a great show because of all the supporting characters in it. I have purchased all videos so far and are waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best final episode is No. 3, denial, anger, acceptance. This episode deals with my most preferred character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed to hijack the wrong truck and accidentally killed a truck driver. Brendan was great because he was actually one of the few characters who actually opposed Tony and his gang. Eventually, he ended up being shot through the eye while taking a bath, and that's my most favorite scene ever in The Sopranos history. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most preferred character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney Park after they have captured and tortured him. My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed just after shooting Christopher. And finally, my # 4 most preferred character is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the amazing characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the soprano. All the cool guys are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change about the Soprano? They should have a whole episode showing all the dead badges in hell, and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they need to avenge themselves. Brendan Filone must be back !!!!!!!!! 1
