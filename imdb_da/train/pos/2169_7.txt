OK, firstly ignore the last person's review. They admit to falling asleep through it, so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was happening !!! As thriller / horror goes, this movie is not that bad, it is certainly very reliable. Right from the opening scenes, you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the madness that follows, and finally, you are proven correct, with all that becomes clear. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, it was pretty scary at times, and as old movies went it was acceptable. Great to see late at night! I give it a generous 7 out of 10.
