I never thought that an old cartoon would bring tears to your eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I would very much like to see the very first Casper comic book titled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, there is Good Boos To-Night (1948) , It made me break down! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox killed! I've never seen anything in the other Casper cartoon! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing, I just couldn't see it again. It's like watching Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, then I see something good and fun! But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
