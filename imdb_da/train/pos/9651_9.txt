What appeared to be first was another introverted French girl offering that became more than baleful to me, by other views, a truly insightful and satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> Spoiler of this kind. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; he didn't know what hit him. The poor audience we were first caught in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story that was only led back and forth in the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didn't hear from their first ambiguous meeting. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the lack of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with a person whose sensuality was more attuned to carnival festivities and romp on beach . <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the camera's action in this movie. The subtitles were completely unnecessary, although my French is "the presque rien." I could see it again without the annoying English translation and enjoying it even more. This was a polished, very professionally made film. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I estimate nine out of ten.
