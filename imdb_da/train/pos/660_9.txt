9 / 10-30 minutes pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it's probably fun. Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story about holiday FEAR, gives us all Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS It's. Bwahahahahha. You really should be careful about what you AX Santa for. Have a scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Okay, I'll stop. Okay, so in history, a greedy woman (best screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets towel beaten in ANOES 2) for the money. BUT her plan is destroyed when a crazy killer dressed in a Christmas gown (Larry "Dr. Giggle's" Drake) comes his way. <br /> <br /> If you look it up on YouTube, you can see it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third view). But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do it.
