This is an excellent film about the characters of an adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It should have steered a wider distribution, as it is much better than similar films from large studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swim instructor is an almost Olympic, reduced to teaching adult basic lessons, and often targets for horndogging from his female students. He tries more or less to avert them with varying results. <br /> <br /> The students are ordinary USA. teachers, police officers, college students, and retirees, all of whom have not learned to swim for some reason. The film covers their relationship, including friends, family and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide entertaining feed, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in class to meet guys. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie or just one to watch when you are in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.
