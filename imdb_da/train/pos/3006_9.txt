While a 9 may seem like an unusually high score for such a small movie, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of serial detective films from the 1930s and 40s, this is among the very best and also compares very positively with Powell's later "Thin Man" movie. Now, it does NOT mean that the movie is the same as the Thin Man films, as KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery detective film. Now you think not having Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic sidekick (something found in virtually any series-detective movie) together for fun would be an injury, but I didn't miss them at all because it was such an unusually well-written movie - has a really interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie begins at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this Philo Vance movie actually spends a bit of time on the dog show and dogs are not a super important part of the movie. Instead, a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room - an idea repeated in a number of other detective films (such as CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE). But all this is explained to be quite credible and fit well together - to keep my interest throughout. I would certainly wish that other detective films from the day had such an intelligent written plot and outstanding action like this. This is definitely a goalie.
