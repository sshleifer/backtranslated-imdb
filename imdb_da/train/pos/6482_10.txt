I was just thirteen when I first saw this series, and I see it again on DVD, over thirty years later. The pictures of the opening credits have never left me. It has affected my view of the world and its peoples. My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the program afterwards. It gave me a love to study history and the highest grades I got in our school's public exams! <br /> <br /> The voice and delivery of Sir Laurence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel this is their version of WWII history. I can't imagine being sad to look at it. Perhaps a similar Cold War series could be considered, although anyone who could replace Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
