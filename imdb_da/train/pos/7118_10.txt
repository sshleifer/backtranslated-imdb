This is a fantastic movie Classic from the 40s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this movie with John Garfield, Al Schmid, "Force of Evil", "48 and Dane Clark, Lee Diamond," Last Rites "and with just one machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to go home After being hurt with a horrible injury, his problems began with his family and dedicated girl friend, beginning with Dane Clark giving an excellent support role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his friend Al, get his life back together There is never a complete victory for war and let's not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in Veterans Hospitals from all the wars and our current Iraq veterans!
