This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; After watching it on YouTube, it is. Seen in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword and sorcery between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Kingdom of Iceland and his Mother Queen Juliana, have put their views on the conquest of the known world. When their glaciers are destroyed, the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) promises to avenge his people and kill the Isher. Meanwhile, they capture the underworld minions of Nekron and Juliana Firekeep's King Jarol's hungry daughter, Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape, and finally Larn meets, promising to escort her back to Firekeep; If the sub-people do not find them first. This movie made very little box office (like most of Ralph Bakshi's film), but has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of the art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. I also heard that the manuscript was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who had made Conan-comic book stories, and the background paintings included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also painter Thomas Kinkade, who noted for his art for characters, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company in addition to paintings. And like Bakshi's movie The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie became rotoscoped, but the process works better in this movie than in the previous one. So in general I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made, and a great collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of imagination, sexual induendo and exciting adventures.
