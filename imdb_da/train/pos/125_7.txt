Lars Von Trier is never back in trying new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He portrays post-war Germany as a nightmare train journey. With so many cities in ruins, Leo Kessler feels a young American of German descent is obliged to help with their restoration. It is not a simple task that he quickly finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a job as a night leader on the Zentropa railway line. His job is to take care of the passengers' needs. When the shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument follows when a passenger's shoe is not chalked despite being polished. There are many prizes for the German fanatics of observing such stupid details. The railway trip is like an allegory that represents man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. In a series of Leo dashes through the back carts to discover them filled with half-starved bodies that apparently have just fled from Auschwitz. These images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own horrible impact not yet connected. <br /> <br /> At a station called Urmitz Leo, the train jumps with a packed bomb. In the light of many city dwellers, he connects the bomb to the underside of a wagon. He returns to his cabin and connects a time clock. Later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass of a river bank. When he looks at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. As he sees the train approaching a giant bridge, he runs at speed to get on the train and stop the clock. If you usually analyze the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Absolutely ridiculous. It could only happen in a dream. It is strange how to remember small details like a series of cups hanging on hooks and rattles away with the train's swing. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is highly acclaimed, I prefer Lars Von Trier's later film (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bombing scene described above really put me off. Maybe I'm a realist.
