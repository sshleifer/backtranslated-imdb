This cartoon is short on the plot but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be much, much smaller spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly weak underground gnomes, responsible for returning each year but must fight against a winter yet clear to retreat. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. It's pretty much the plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot - it's about the color and the animation. The pictures are unusual. Back in 1936, such a bright color was still something of a novelty, and there is some incredibly inspired work here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquid colors through pipes. At more than one point, a series of tubes are arranged in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the tubes, and the musical track makes it appear as if the row is a tube member. <br /> <br /> The image's images between the growing green and the winter storm, which refuse to leave quietly, are extremely well done. These types of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they probably also contributed to their final departure from the MGM because this cartoon probably went over budget and the MGM finally decided they could control the cost better if the animation department was controlled. of some slightly more aware of costs than Harman and Ising were. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and worth seeing. It is available on DVD Attack of the '30s Sign. Highly recommended, especially if you like good animation.
