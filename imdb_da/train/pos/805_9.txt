"The return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong instead of what it did right, and it is a shame because the last chronological episode in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It successfully wraps all the story lines of the previous movies into a grand finale and makes it so compelling. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cozy bears that may have served to expand the demographic Star Wars - and in the middle, the film tends to slow down. But the final hour is undoubtedly the best piece of the whole saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in film history. <br /> <br /> The return of Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader Big Line (which went from a bit unlikely to "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabbas Palace, a masterful achievement by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor, Luke finally comes to his own, the disintegration of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful last moments of the Endor Moon. Yes, there are minor irritations. But they are irritations of a generation of movie guests who have had time to nitpick every scene. It is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a good last chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's amazing!
