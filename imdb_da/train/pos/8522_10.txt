I found this show really late at night and tried it. It's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things that appear late at night if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of values ​​and sweetness hearts helps remind how friendships were like children. It's something I spoil when I find it (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the lists! Haha) ..... and the excitement between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like any good chick flick, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Good ol Louisa May Alcott still inspiring good stories :) So obviously I have to fill 10 lines of text so my opinion must be valid, so I think I will tell you a little more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and natural - another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone gives it a shot. I recognize and am fully aware that it is sappy, but it is good heart. As I said before, it is refreshing.
