Just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. First of all, to get things right, this movie does not pretend to be anything but a solid action comedy movie. It does not aim to revolutionize the film industry and achieve critical acclaim, nor will it be considered one. If you really want to enjoy this movie fully, I suggest you discard your critical attitude and your longing for a good plot because you don't find anyone in here. With that established, let's further into the movie. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this movie, simply because it didn't have a strong plot (yes, movie gamers, I also underestimated this movie), but I never expected myself to enjoy this movie so much. I also enjoyed this more than the Stephen Chow flicks (as I find Kung Fu Hustle to be his best bet and would have rated it a 9). The action is tight and epic, while the comedy stifles in the right places. SPOILERS alert, I think the action may be unreal, but why would I like to see a serious basketball movie anyway? There are many other sports films (drama) that already did well, why create another? SPOILERS Than <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and see it. Just remember, no thinking - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and <br /> Every time they (the film industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies that is better in the pile of dumps. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, so again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow-ish comedy, this is a top ten. Recommended if you love: no brainer movie with really good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -What, see it here. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for those who are cast by Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
