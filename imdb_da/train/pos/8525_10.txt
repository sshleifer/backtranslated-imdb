To judge this movie, you should think about the genre it should be: children's. They had several guidelines to follow to make this movie (meaning it couldn't get away with some humor and or language from 1.) taking all that in this movie was fun and fun to watch. Sequels usually make me nervous, but it did quite well for themselves. Knowing that it did not have the star force of Fraiser like George, they capitalized on humor, and I think Showeman did pretty well as the lead. The reason is easy to follow and maybe camp at times fits well with a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for academic award, it is not, but if you want to see a simple, fun, energy-filled movie you would do a great choice with this one.
