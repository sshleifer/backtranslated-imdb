She is forced to seduce men to her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of stumbling stupid, but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing is trying to protect him from other spirits in the forest, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the forest.

The film makes a lot of traditional old martial arts acrobatics with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree with elegant long robes and scarves, but the film is flowing right and everything is effective. <br /> <Tsing must be married to an evil wood monster, which can not be good, and we feel her situation in her home, where we meet her sisters and grandmother who really are not nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, they have to fight with a deadly witch's tree witch and deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand-year-old evil to save their souls and bring Lings ashes back to her home. a proper funeral, so she might have a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really emphasizes details. You are touched in many ways by this movie, you will laugh, cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and movies. And although at the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin go out into the morning sun under an enchanting rainbow, we never know if Tsing got a reincarnation, but we know her
