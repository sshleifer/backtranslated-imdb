I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, so grew even more fascinated by her reach and skill in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this amazing depiction of a rich girl who spurning breeding and convention in favor of the mother of the tortured soul of a child's child, who clearly needs mother. Her eyes are mirrored to her soul - and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are. <br /> <br /> Those who take things literally will find Marleen Gorris' poetic and allegorical direction rather frustrating. Romanticists who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy are this filmed allegorical poem that will be well rewarded.
