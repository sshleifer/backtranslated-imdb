What a great movie! Finally, a picture revealing an unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Famous Rockers are old and forgot, not the music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced at Bill Haley's Rock around the clock? Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I've ever seen. Much far better than Spinal Tap for example. Why? Because in constantly crazy people are mature. They have a different view on rock, about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, they miss so much. In addition to the story itself, we see signs of their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time watching this (listen to the amazing soundtrack!) And finally think about your own future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
