Several years ago, the Navy held a distance away from "Honor Men's", a film based on the experience of the services' first black champion diving battle to overcome virulent racism. Ever eager to support films showing our Navy's best side in the US. Nimitz and two helicopters with support sea installations were performed to complement this exciting tale of a young sailor's fight with uncontrollable rage. Some of the film was shot aboard the U.S.S. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the manuscript of Denzel Washington's director's debut, where he founded as a marine psychiatrist who treats Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is a naturally-acclaimed man awarded the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front-line helicopter assault platform. Fisher cannot seem to avoid launching his own assaults by minimal provocation from his fellow human beings. Sent to MD as part of a possible pre-separation, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist and reveals a horrible childhood of great neglect and appalling brutality. The story evolves like Fisher gently, but increasingly trusting his doctor and getting the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named Cheryl, played by an astonishingly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly opposes the doctor by asking long simulation questions, but soon he realizes he should seek the answers, yet painful, to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior. While all the protagonists are black, this story transcends race, while unclearly shows the malice of exuberant religiosity and simultaneous hypocrisy in foster family settings. Viola Davis, a versatile actress, seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality, but is nothing to foster mother, Mrs Tate (Novella Nelson), who would serve in short but hurtful scenes - if it existed Oscar for gut-churning brutality. <br /> <br /> Patient therapy interaction films follow some predictability (all of the transmission and counter transmission issues), but Fisher's and his / her doctor / mentor are grave. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> While Antwone Fisher is in the Navy, it is not really a service story that was "Men of Honor", an excellent movie dealing with crushing racism against a real person. Nor is it a movie about blacks. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood, the victim still stands "standing tall". The persecutors shrink in size and importance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life through a caring doctor. My only drawback is that Washington is a lieutenant commander, but is directed as a commander. With all the Navy supporters listed in the final credit, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, which all naval officers under the commander's rank, are addressed as "Mister". Not a big criticism, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie plays in so few theaters. It deserves broad distribution. Derek Luke may well receive an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
