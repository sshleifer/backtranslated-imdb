Enjoyed the movie and effective Confucian drama, the ancient order survives the threat of a brash young greedy man who undoubtedly represents modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to think that the big D was punished for being greedy, or it was part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts celebration. On things that always love me about HK movies, the greatest influence that the British seem to have had is to introduce 'yes gentleman' and 'excuse' to the local language and it is fun that long after we are gone, they are still there.
