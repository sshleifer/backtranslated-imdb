If you examine UFO facts, this video is very important. "Meat" of the video is comments from Buzz Aldrin. He is undoubtedly from the best of America. Train to be objective, honest and in fact in his reports. Many American astronauts of all eras have reported some kind of contact or UFO compliance, and there are videos from some of these missions. At least something has happened that requires additional objective ongoing investigation. I believe that this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds might be interested in our progress. Like all supposed documentary videos, this can be oblique, but it contains additional information and opinions from an accomplished American hero. They do not come together every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in details should not detract from your viewing of this video. If nothing else, it is interesting and I recommend that you look with an open mind.
