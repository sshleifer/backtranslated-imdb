Like many people here, I began to find my patience that was tried by this movie. In the end I actually scolded a few tears. It seems to be in the character of most old films to draw in the 7 / 8th length and then get the fire to the right at the end. Older movie guests learned to pray their time patiently through the slow parts, quietly in the knowledge that the big payout is coming. But that is not entirely correct. You see, to previous audiences, what are we "the slow parts" was the main body of the story. They saw and found anecdotal and thematic interests there. Modern audiences, post-Spielberg, are constantly waiting to be hit with a little climax every two minutes when watching older movies. It is the problem of inflation with modern films. Well, that's not gonna happen. There is no need to apologize for these films; It is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you see them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is like the difference between Euripides and a travel development of Rent. Think of it for a moment or two. Not to push the obvious, but Euripides still deserves a hearing. The "exciting part" for most modern viewers begins with the IRA tribal scene and escalates to the last few minutes if you are on board or even paying attention at that time, will tear your heart out. It is not a high tone universal abstract care for forgiveness; it is a plea from a dim white, and those who are sad about the big lummox, too little mercy. It is so personal and it is embarrassingly naked an appeal. Because after getting angry at Gypo, annoyed at him, and thought this is the stupidest thing of all time, you'll finally find yourself won over by Gypo's former boyfriend to speak to another woman to speak her husband to go easy on him. <br /> <br /> The movie may be sentimental, but the sentimentality is not cheap, as some have charged. There is a matter of life and death that plays out here, and as long as you take one life to a customer seriously, the sentimentality is twisted out of the most serious thing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. And the blame for not being 10 out of 10 is my own and to some extent yours if you read this. We've all been asking for more and more faster, ever faster until we can't set ourselves in 1935 - just yesterday, really - just as easily as we should.
