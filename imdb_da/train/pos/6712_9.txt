I love Sabrina! Its one of my fave shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one where she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love section and most of the rest from the first series. I think college episodes were not as good as high school, but they were better than the last series that was terrible. Valerie was a good character when she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were fantastic and there was no explanation for where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they were just not as good as her other friends.
