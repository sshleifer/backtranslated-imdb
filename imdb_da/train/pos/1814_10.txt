All Dogs Going to heaven is in my opinion the best animated movie ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated movies, but there's something about this that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is wonderful, like the performances by Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's make music together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie music I've seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
