To say that this film is simply a demonization of Catholics, and a misrepresentation of the story is unlikely. This is not what this film is. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a comment on Church abuse (though this could replace any strong body), the ways of this abuse affect people and families and the way many people choose to allow and often participate in abuse without thinking of themselves. The fact that it is the Catholic Church that is in the wrong is simply because of the true history on which the film is based. To feel this as propaganda against Catholics seems to miss the truth about what the Catholic Church has done at times; Its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and it must be emphasized. Yes, we have to comment on the abuse committed by other organizations, but it is not for this movie. It's a great movie that brought me to tears and worth watching - "if we don't study the past, we're bound to repeat it"
