This reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. It is the story of a band that makes a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray. You were sorry for him, but he had some creepiness about him. It's a great movie to see if you've ever seen your favorite band get wrinkled, old and pathetic. Bittersweet, highly recommended ..
