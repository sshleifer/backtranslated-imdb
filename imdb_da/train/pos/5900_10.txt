I am very sorry that this charming and capricious movie (which I first received only shortly after it was released in the early fifties) has had such a poor reception recently. In my opinion, it has been underestimated - but perhaps it appeals more to the European sense of humor than to (for example) the American: perhaps we in Europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more, as we are closer to some of them in real life! Particular mention is made of the limited but good music - especially the captivating and memorable song "It's fine fine night", which was published separately on a HMV 78rpm record (10 inch square cable, I think!) In the 50s. I would encourage anyone interested to try it if you get the chance: you can have a pleasant surprise.
