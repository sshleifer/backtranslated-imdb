Perfect for families with young children seeking light-hearted movies that do not contain violence and are enchanting for the child and entertaining, albeit quite corny, for adults. Not a bad movie for a low budget job. Children will be amazed at Santa's workshop and the "magic" that allows him to enter the home through chimneys that seem too small or homes that do not have chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> Children will be excited about Santa's success in addressing the nasty devil named Pitch (complete in classic red clothes with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl whose greatest desire is to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who only wants to spend time with his eternally absent parents. And what kid doesn't know anyone in school who is like the unpleasant boys who are preoccupied with Pitch to help catch Christmas and ruin Christmas? Eventually, everyone, including the ugly boys, gets just what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The movie will endear children to both the santa and love message that he provides to people all over the world. <Br /> <br />
