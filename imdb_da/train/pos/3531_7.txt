Robert Siodmak does a fantastic job with this B noir with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does what I can add without much help from his male actors, ie. Curtis and Tone. It's Raines all the way, a beautiful, leggy actress who for some reason never reached the status of some of her "noir" colleagues. <br /> <br /> Siodmak uses sex, light, shadows, and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre. The shadows, light effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the movie takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook, the egg of an excited Raines. It is this scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is only matched by Raines, who gives a sincere performance as a woman who loves to try to save her husband. Franchot Tone called one. Alan Curtis did not seem disturbed that he could die and did not feel happy that he was alive. And he never seemed to fall in love with Raines, except for a brief moment in prison. The entertaining thing about many of these films is that as World War II progressed, interest in psychiatry was deepened. But often the terms were used incorrectly in movies like "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Great Show on Earth." Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has a paranoia associated with his suffering, but he seems to be closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headache, he may have had a brain tumor that pushes against his brain. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Lady doesn't have the biggest plot, but it's worth seeing.
