Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a bit long to sit through in a meeting, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is great as Rochester. I was glad they threw an ordinary actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to see !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I've seen my VHS copy almost break so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
