To get in touch with the beauty of this movie, pay attention to the soundtrack, not just the music, but how all sounds help to weave the picture. How beautifully creates the opening scene, leading to the expulsion of the Gino theme of moral ambiguity! Notice how music introduces the characters that we lead into Giovanni's marriage. Don't expect to find much here in Italy's political life in 1943. It's not about this. On the other hand, if you are receptive to music of pictures and sounds, you are led into a word that goes beyond neo-realism. At the end of the film there are moments of Antonioni-like landscape that have more to do with the inner life of India than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
