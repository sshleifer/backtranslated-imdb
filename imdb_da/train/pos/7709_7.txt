I know I want to like this movie, and I do most of the time, but as others have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. I also found the raging hormones throughout the crew to be a little annoying. It's weird that they didn't start to pan and shine in the moons too. I also have to say it in general, the film leaves me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the plus side, the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), like the effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I don't think it would have been as popular as it was. The other half of the movie captures steam when we begin to examine the forgotten gadgets of "Krell". As many times as I've seen this movie, Krell still leaves me scraping my head to exactly who or what they were. Based on what was produced at that time, in addition to "This Island Earth", Forbidden Planet is miles above the average Sci-Fi movie of the time. Being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. Certainly a classic in itself, mistakes and all, and deserved it.
