Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although reminiscent of his later trip in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York figure, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we usually identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the film's history by playing the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances well above their normal levels. Voight's Buck is so na√Øve that he will flow completely out of the movie unless Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is an escape movie that becomes a movie about finding yourself. I think it's a very beautiful message that gritty a movie, no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines "loser") if you can find a way to be true to yourself, You are in possession of the secret of life and you may even be able to share that insight with another. <br /> <br /> I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself a movie about an escape.
