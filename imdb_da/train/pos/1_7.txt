If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is almost a similar format about the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and listed as bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the school's teachers. There is the idiotic principal, Mr. Beeps, the nervous mathematics teacher and many others. Cast is also amazing, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, East Enders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringer's Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti. I didn't know this came from Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
