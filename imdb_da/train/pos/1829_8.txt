What a fun movie St. Ives is. It reminds me of the type of movie that was made during the 40s. Classical history, rounded off with characters and a plot that is neither dramatic nor obviously complicated. In fact, it's not over anything. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - adapted to the screen here - resembles Jane Austen for men. We get a story that has a romance in its heart, but there are also fun: fighting scenes (kind), prison escape, wrong identities, swords and the funniest line I've heard this year: "Only in Scotland will guests be announced by name of a masked ball. "There is a lot of hilarity, adversity and not a little heartbeat when St. Ives is trying to fight and find his way back to a family and the life he didn't know. The support is absolutely fantastic with too rarely seen Jean Marc Barr perfectly in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing joy when the resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson almost go away with the movie as her wise and secular, has been there and seen-all-aunt Susan. Richard Grant gives the cartoonist the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not going to be the best movie anyone has ever seen, but its charm is undeniable, and the whole movie pretty much counts with an energy bursting with life.
