Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven carnage. Also cheesy, of course and occasionally very cheesy. It reminded me a lot about The Big Heat because it has the revenge plot with the exact same event, and the girl comes to the good guy because of the bad guy's same bad behavior. It is sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but so wonderful that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Can anyone be as beautiful as Alain goes around in a cashmere sweater and trench coat? Still, he is quite hard and ice cold. No one can touch him today - even though someone like Jude Law could try I guess. Hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect, and there were several good cars (and they are generally not my cup of tea) - especially a willy nilly in the woods. People also met their judgments in a creative and bloody way, for example in a junkyard cruncher. But in addition to the cheese, the overall atmosphere was influenced and professionally pulled off. More creativity, excitement and freshness in the "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
