Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The film is well written and the play seems like real life. For all lovers of Columbo, this is an overall job. Because it shows what Peter Falk's talent is. He does not play a detective playing a retired carpet dealer. Once the credits start playing, you will already see it again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to any person who sees it; The depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies. It is a shame that the liberals in Hollywood only promote dirt and skin because it is the type of movie that the people of the company should be proud of. This would be a great movie to become a live stage game.
