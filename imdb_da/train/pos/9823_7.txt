I really thought it wasn't that bad. Not a good work of art, but Dermot M was by far the strongest artist. Patricia Arquette took over much of the time. He actually played cello, which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add it to the talent, and most of what he has been in is much more acceptable. He always gives his all himself, if some of the projects he has been involved in didn't really hit the highest mark. Not the actor is due in most cases. Unfortunately, he has been in some strange films that just don't resonate at the box office. Always with A-list actors, but just not always a "hit". But he is "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or purchased. See the wedding anniversary with Debra Messing - one of his best movie overalls. WORTH EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you haven't seen it yet, you understand that quote!)
