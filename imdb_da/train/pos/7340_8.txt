This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is about action. What differs from other animations is how well the human movements are animated. It was really beautiful to see the fugitive woman running around the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were done as well. Why don't they use this rotocopic technique more these days? It's quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, prehistoric and barely dressed, were clearly devoted to showing the beautiful lady of distress in various sexy ways where her stuffed body served as pure eye-catcher. Some may hate this and consider it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will love it's aesthetic quality. I certainly do not mind! Bakshi just loves animating lush, successful babes, as can be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he should apologize, as it's pretty much animation for adults. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child, and I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime ticket price and therefore worth looking at the page since it may be Bakshi's finest. For those who like animation with lush women: Also try the Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
