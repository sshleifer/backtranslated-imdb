When I watched this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. Its greatness kept my attention to such an extent that I focused my entire attention on it all the time. I would recommend seeing it not only to fans of anime, but to someone who likes great movie period (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism of it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into the movie, but I think the way it does is complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-proclaimed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film of absolute epic proportions. I would like to find more works by the one who did this and see them.
