I am Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series were shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first people I was interested in. Unfortunately, there was a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of the series to crap kids coming to see today. So because of my overprotective mothers of the 60s, I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I was so frustrated, I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still have them!) To compensate. I even got View Master slides ... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally got the chance to see re-runs as a youth, and I enjoyed it tremendously. The tongue-in-cheek would have escaped me as I would have seen it as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I've seen them all now and the occasional friendly soul on the internet episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I enjoyed "Return to the Bat" ... It was a pleasure to see because it was full of trivia and inside jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was a joy, and this television movie is simply amazing in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "party" ... I want to see it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend it from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect to judge this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
