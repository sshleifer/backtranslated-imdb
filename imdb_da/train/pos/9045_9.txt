There is a bit of trivia that should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie, where Homer looks at the experiment on December 6, 1957 (at least it was the video used on the TV he watched) showing Vangard launch attempts. that failed. <br /> <br /> Next, he is shown to read or dictate a letter to Dr. Von Braun, who offers condolences about the error. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville working for the army. The Vanguard project was at the early Nasa team, which was about to soon become Goddard Space aerodrome. <br /> <br /> The army rushed Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US-made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This error can actually be made by Homer, because of Von Braun's notoriety, but his team did not fail their attempts. In fact, the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first American-man-rated booster to be used for Shepard's sub-orbital flight, as well as Grissoms. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this kind of movie is as good as it will hopefully inspire people to read and see these bits of trivia, and in the process of seeing what has been done and being inspired to do more.
