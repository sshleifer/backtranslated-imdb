Being that I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, made me even more eager to check this flick. I remember he was interviewed at "Jay Leno" and said he played a role in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in this movie. Obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he had taken chops. I'm not going to exaggerate Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants." There are probably better rappers / actors like Mos Def who could have done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a "good" job. He does not seem to shake some of his trademark movements and vocal bends, but that is something even though Jack Nicholson has a problem with. The point is that I found him convincing in the role, and the excitement between him and Dylan McDermott's character captivating. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the movie, although his subtle plays are probably overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle plays. Being a great reader and aspiring author himself couldn't help me find the characters and plot something fascinating. It aggravated me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work and tell him to criticize it. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character should be defective, as McDermott was in his own way. My only mild criticism of the movie would be its end. For some reason, it just felt premature for me, even though the decision was certainly sensible and motivated by the signs, rather than the plot.
