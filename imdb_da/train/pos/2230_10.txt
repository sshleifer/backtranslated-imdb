I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was broadcast on television in 1983. All I remember was that it was about a teenaged girl alone after surviving a plane crash and surviving the Amazon. I remember people looking for her (family) and that she knew how to take care of herself --- she tells the story and I remember alive about her knowing that bugs were under her skin. I can't remember much else about this movie and would like to see it again - if this is the same - and if any of you have a copy, can you send me an email to horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be curious to get a copy to see if it is actually the same movie I remember. It was sent on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983 and I went through my own problems and this movie has really affected me heavily. Thanks in advance!
