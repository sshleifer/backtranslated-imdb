This is one of those movies that does not require any brain or thinking, it is a very fun time that you have forgotten in the next hour or so. I was really surprised by John Abraham's play, he usually plays gangster as character with the numb face, so from playing the opposite and doing it successfully, steering to shine among the comic geniuses like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also totally surprised by Akshaye's 3 girls because roles don't require much talent but mostly moaned about Akshaye's dissapearence (for the other girls) I was surprised when they managed to establish and actually persona and you could distinguish them which is a good thing, also the majority of songs are good, it is colorful and fun so on a boring sunday night, it will definitely ease your mood.
