The story would never win awards, but it's not about it ... the script was just entertaining and exciting enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed battle scenes. Who needs a story to fight like that? It is really worth seeing for that reason alone. IF you can handle gore, of which there is a lot ... none of it made realistic enough to be hard to look at. I gave it a 7.
