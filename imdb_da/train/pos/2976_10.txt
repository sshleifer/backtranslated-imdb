For a comedy, this has a decent and inventive plot, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone's comic timing is perfect. There are dozens of fun moments for this amazing movie. I especially like the many colors and the way that collides in the sports scenes. Robert Stack's unresolved mysteries of spoof are also very fun.
