One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season it started to go downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to look at her, and Ernest Borgnine's character went on with each other. The last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for the second season. Unfortunately, there were no longer blacks on TV shows these days. Some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season was more about the human characters than Airwolf and it was not shown until almost the end of the show. When it went to the US, it was disgusting !!!
