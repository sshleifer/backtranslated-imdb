What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is the way Joe Buck gets tied to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships affecting both of them. There is really not many glimpses of hope in this movie to neither character, but the hard realities that occupy them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other. <br /> <br /> This movie features Jon Voight's finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffmans as well. The rest of the casting consists of unknowns, although it is rounded off by a fine series of character players, including cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film. Also for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows briefly during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, it's important. Check it out.
