I noticed that many people posting on "Kerching!" Board seems to hate this show, which I actually find very surprising. I think it's one of the best British children's shows there is. It's a shame it ends because it's very fun (if it's a bit cheesy sometimes) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, even though it is much smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to make a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym for "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simply and comically relief character). During the show some signs are left and new ones have come in, but it has always been entertaining and better.
