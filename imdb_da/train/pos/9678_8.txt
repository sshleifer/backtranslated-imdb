Made me wish my own happy birds could talk. Thick spank on the reviewers who spread the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovable little treasure. He has a few clever lines that really made me laugh. I especially loved the dancing sequences during his showbiz stint. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s that you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie. A charming movie featuring two strong characters who really turn to the little parrot separated from his young owner. Would have liked to see more of the woman who gets blind and has to give up their joint journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame that she couldn't share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in her new home, finally with Marie, perhaps with the beautiful young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
