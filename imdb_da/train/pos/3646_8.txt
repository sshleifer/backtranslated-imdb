Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a formerly minor league pich, who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history that ended a nearly 10-year retirement and made his Major League debut in 1999 in The age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief summary of Morris's childhood, which included a series of repatriations - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled well in football's rugged Texas, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in fact, it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he was trying a career as a baseball player, but that it didn't work. <br /> <br /> Morris teams are struggling and he refines them to give up on their dreams. They turn the table over to him and tell him to try a Major League team. On several occasions when he is pitched to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed he throws. Morris does not seem to be convinced, but agrees with an agreement with his players, where if they win the district, he will try for a Major League team. Big Lake wins district and adheres to the end of the deal, Morris joining a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw under his minor league career and an excellent speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another test with the team, Morris offered a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves him a tough decision - staying in his comfortable life or again pursuing his Major League dream by going through the small league beats making a little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more disturbing than in his first minor league, because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris characters with the devil beams begin at the AA level and move fast up to the AAA level, a level below Major League Baseball. But as the season comes down, the chances of him being "named" become more and more slender. For the most part, I love this movie. There are plenty of good performances and similar characters, and it's easy to find yourself who really draws to Morris. The film also does a good job showing professional baseball at both big and small league levels. And most of all, the timeless message teaches you to hold on to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> The movie still has some errors. While it is generally accurate, it exaggerates and even produces a few things. See http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Apart from a scene where he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But considering Disney's left zeal, it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Probably many exaggerations were made to make the story more dramatic. But the 20-minute documentary on Morris, which is included on the DVD, contains some information that makes its story more dramatic but out of the movie. For example, from birth to his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris traveled 14 times. And his first minor league career ended after four operations, through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, making his throw 98 mph even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully understand and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not only to see "The Rookie" but to see the DVD's documentary, see the link above to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris's biography entitled "The Rookie". I haven't read the book, but I hope for one of those days. But in general, "The Rookie" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a strong testament to the power of dreams and the common man's triumph. 8.10
