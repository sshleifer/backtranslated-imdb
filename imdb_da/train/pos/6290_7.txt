Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him a chance to show these talents in a small travel time. He gets confused with a guy who lives in modern times, and it becomes clear that we are best back in our own times Keaton is able to make the sight gags very good. I've heard his voice before. I think he did some of these Beach Party movies and played some vacuum signs to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to respect him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how to respond when we want something we do not have and desire.
