This is a very strange movie by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about Williams's work knows that it's a little off-kilter (if not brilliant), but this one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> It has two rude ragdolls that will save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find mercy on several bizarre characters along the way. The strength of this film lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character design, its powerful animation and its sharp contrast of sweet and scary. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as true rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, making it more credible (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines on bringing us camel-with-wrinkled knees whose body goes with two different personalities that control each end, the silent movie hunt with Sir Leonard Looney and of course the greedy one. <br /> <br /> The greedy animation is in itself the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop - and every second it's something new. Living in what was considered "Taffy Pit", the Greedy is a massive blob man living in and viciously eating sweets. He sings a song that I can't help but feels like some sexual undertones, so try to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart. The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. It is bogging down the film's pace because there are six of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones), including "I see and what do I see?", "No girl's toys", "Blue" (though they didn't have to make him sing it twice) , "I never get enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home". The others just seem unnecessary and honestly not so great to listen to. <br /> <br /> This is a weird movie with weird undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find better.
