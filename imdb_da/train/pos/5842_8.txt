Can I be so simple and primitive in my reviews that I just say "I liked it"? It is reasonably fun with bits, it has big stars and it is beautiful to look at. The songs (there are about two that are repeated) are forgettable, but they get a healthy ironic (like the terribly beautiful Mr. Fairbanks that explodes in the terrible Wagner version of the messenger that Miss Grable has just reproduced); There is not much to dance with all 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable, and comedy can be a little heavily handed out, but the result is still very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots that are excitement) is amazing, playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is a little past her prime and on the plumpish side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "olde worlde" comedy. It's pretty much along the line "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and it tends to be very dishonored by many. So I suppose more people would consider "That Lady in Ermine" to be outdated and stuffy. But it is an adventure and they tend to move together on a particular pasta anyway. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty script and everything else this movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film has been released on DVD in Germany, with both German and English soundtracks.
