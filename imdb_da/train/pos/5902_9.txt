As a Westerner looking at another culture's view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married fascinating and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the parents' joint arrangement is difficult, especially in this modern age. Nevertheless, this is the case in this Hindi movie. Told with humor and new perspective, we learn about Abhay and Ritika, who have only met once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As I said, it is hard to believe in this mobile's prosperous age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still takes place. We see it awkward that this young couple feels when they come together on their first night and how they try to decay a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different perceptions of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on vacation, from a few forty years married to others still uncertain of making marital engagement. There is song, witty dialogue, exciting moments, mixing and comparing new ways and tradition. Seeing the movie with subtitles certainly loses some of the credibility of history, but it is still a pleasure to see. Allowed some of the plot is a small trite and the bus is a little pronounced and constructed; but the overall movie was worth seeing.
