Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let it fool you. In my little book there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dolls of humor. Fang the redoubtable Mrs. Ports to keep track of document location. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did the indie producers come up with the goat to film in color, a wise decision, as the block would not show well in b & w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrates. But apart from several teenagers, non-Hollywood casting works well. Then the city play among hot-rodders and the police comes to be as lively and entertaining. Well darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than at a solid stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "youth offenses". Then again, 27-year-old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age division, but at least controls the hot rudder setting. The movie was a hit at the time, undoubtedly helped with the exciting title tune that got a lot of radio games. And apart from the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, loading or no loading. In the meantime, I await the blob's return, as the polar ice turns, we must say, refrigerator water.
