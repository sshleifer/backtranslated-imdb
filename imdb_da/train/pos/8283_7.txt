A solid B-movie. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. His undervalued delivery is refreshing at a time of the best performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the child's toys and the dead deer. It's a merger like, see? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy slash em up instant gratification flick. See it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie may have to say to you and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> Nice work.
