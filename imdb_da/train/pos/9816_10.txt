Violation is pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the movie and was perfect for that! It's hard to believe this is a true story, but what can you do? When I saw this I thought why they should do all these things. It's not true, but they learned their lesson when they picked up the wrong man! Anyway if you ever see this movie on TV watch it because it's a good one!
