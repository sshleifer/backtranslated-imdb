Don't misunderstand "War Inc." to a sharp chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of interior jokes to the news. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned scrub comedy with ridiculously random plots, stock characters (given a depth of fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a fair approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the filmmakers' political points are things that almost all countries know are true. Yes, we understand that the companies that benefit from the war are corrupt, inappropriate pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inactive buffoons, and US imperialism has never seen tenderness and more out of touch than it does right now - but none of that is meant. <br /> <br /> Here's all the noise the setting they light - sometimes in brilliant ways - as the backdrop for a silly body like John Cusack's character (hit one with a heart) trying to change his life with help from the do-gooder journalist who does not trust him (Tomei) and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to interrupt his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA manager. <br /> <br /> That's all and it works. It's simple fun, but if you somehow can't see reality and you think the war goes well and everyone involved in it does a good job and there is no corruption and people in the Middle East want Our Western culture would replace theirs so you might not find it so much fun. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it was an easy comedy with a political edge.
