SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> Number 1 - TV show of all time <br /> Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would not pass a pilot episode . The Soprano has become a cultural phenomenon and is universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime commander, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star cast. Edie Falco is great as the worrying, loving middle-class mother; Tony Sirico is huge as a superstitious, graying consiglieri, which is often very fun. <br /> <br /> While the show has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans such as mafiosi, and to some extent it is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The depiction of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Can this be present in a rough TV show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. are discussed. This is not a low and boring show of fierce guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the problems we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which has been quite large, has infused so lucky current issues and managed to immerse them within the characters' lives, making it all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit should go to David Chase, who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, to imagine the TV's most complex and enigmatic character. <br /> <br /> Just outstanding. <br /> <br /> 10/10
