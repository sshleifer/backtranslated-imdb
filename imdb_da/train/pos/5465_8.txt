This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers movie featuring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A perfect champion to exhibit Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck Lily Powers, the well-behaved daughter of a fierce speakeasy owner in a stifling steel town, plays. She has been cynical and emotional for many years after being offered as a sexual benefit to her father's customers. When her father dies in a distillation explosion, she jumps a freight train to New York and literally places her way up the bank's corporate ladder. <br /> <br /> This would come across so it wasn't for Stanwyk's fiery work here. With her dead eyes and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to their aggressive carnival. One of the young men she seduces along the way is John Wayne, who is fresh, as for all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The Melodrama becomes heavy-handed against the last third of the film with a murder suicide, a hush-hush job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president so reliant on Lily that he dampens the company's means of keeping her in luxury . A tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck hurt the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's bonding friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about the Nietzsche philosophy about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
