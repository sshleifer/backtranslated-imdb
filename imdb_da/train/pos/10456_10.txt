This movie is not about entertainment, or even a movie you want to see to pass the time. This movie is really a screen of true love that can only come from God. You can't help but be touched by watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this movie. There is God's divine love, which is beautifully depicted. God's love transcends the heart and mind and lasts and lasts forever. There is the love of a marriage. While the protagonist grapples with his wife's illness, he realizes through God's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have love for children and parents. The kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters, except that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love does not do well unless given to someone else. I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen !!
