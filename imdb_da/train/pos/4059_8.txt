The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa, is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an SF epic, this is more an action-comedy adventure with a rather weak SF premise. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the movie, I thought I would love it. Once again, you find yourself in Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to evoke an imaginary world in meticulous and beautiful perfection. The animation, but still not in the league for the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> In my review of Nausicaa I mentioned that a character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here are a lot of them: the pirates. They give the comic element of the movie, but quite why it needs a comic element, I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better for it. Still. That said, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the movie (although she is basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you are reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well-spoken by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> The English cast casts itself well for the most part actually. But something started to go pear-shaped for me about this movie at about halfway the mark. I think the best way I could describe it is that the characters are extinguished by the vast range of history. I'll come back to that later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people of course love that I almost feel that they only give it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire' . It was more impressive than personally affected, and in more than two hours it just started to pull. What mattered to me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken care of developing the characters so you really fall for them, rather than letting them stay as relatively two-dimensional pieces to move as you gawked at the amazing views in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was any hard SF in history to cope with it, but it was basically much gobledegook about princesses and magical crystals. This is where Laputa falls as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues in front of Disney in general in 1986, considering that their movie in that year was the rather bad 'Great Mouse Detective'. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a great movie in some ways a great movie, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the former "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind". <br /> <br /> BTW, if you manage to see them in chronological order, make sure the Nausicaa fox grain appears short in Laputa.
