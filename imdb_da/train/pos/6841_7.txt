This is probably one of Brian De Palma's most famous films, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock, and this film is a start at Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a boring housewife thinking of having an affair, and after her psychiatrist is played by Michael Caine, knocks down an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery, and she starts to sleep with him. After this point, it's best that you don't know what's happening, but there's a murder, and Nancy Allen is a call girl looking at the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective of the case who really does not trust Allen and she must find the killer herself. It's a pretty good movie, but isn't one of De Palma's best.
