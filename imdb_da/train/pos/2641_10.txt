Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty during this period. From a historic view, the end of the Vietnam War left us all with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this movie and he deserved the credits he received from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie does not appear more often or at all. This movie is the kind of movie to show on television every year, like the Wizard of Oz. A man's devotion to his missing son is completely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans, and I was proud to know him. Rocky
