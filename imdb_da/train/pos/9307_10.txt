Not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I am a lover of black comedy. With a casting that includes Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls London) in the leaders, the lines can only help dry. The support molding is almost dead center. Count the minor errors in the movie: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave her face a washed out look; there were a few gimme cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who served some purpose and Michael J. Pollard's screenplay was too short. Over all, the casting was just incredible without egos to destroy a fine script. If you've seen Larry Bishops (writer, director) movies, Underworld (a dark crime flick), you'll enjoy this one. His next trip (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
