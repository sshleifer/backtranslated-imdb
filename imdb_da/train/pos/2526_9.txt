It is fantastic! In Story Mode, you go from punk to pro. You must complete goals involving skating, driving and hiking. You create your own skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he confuses you and gets you kicked by the skateboarding team (you can choose a team to be on) and you start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story state) from Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they are talking about. If you get sad to do so, you can make the prized goals in prized parks. The only thing I didn't like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive the cars. 10.9.
