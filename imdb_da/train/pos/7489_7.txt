This film has many strong points. It has one of the best horror throws outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus leading man Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone stairs, a crazy scientist, urban waving torches and hunting vampires, an "Igor" -type character, a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired burgomaster. The soft focus of camera work is mood and imaginative. There are even some good comics that are nicely distributed throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because there's nothing supernatural in "Kleinschloss" ("small castle"). The reason is about the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by Atwill) who appreciates his work more than human life. It's not top-tier material because of a ho-ho resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly poor dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it is worth seeing if you like early b / w horror pictures.
