I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host in the show, hands down. I hate celebrity and generally don't talk at speech shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted the Talk Soup, watching TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his race, and was sad when the guest's hosts started pouring in (though most of the guests still did a good job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all the people who don't like Hal Sparks, I imagine they should never have seen the weekend deals. They were hours of episodes of Talk Soup that consisted of the best clips of the entire week and were padded with sketch comedy bits. The original bits that Hal Sparks did were fun. In one, he was obsessed with a bad comedy demon, and in an exorcist scene, his head tense as he told dated jokes about airline food. An episode was dedicated to making fun of Multiplicity when a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks continued to multiply through the episode that overflowed into the studio. Okay, maybe it may not sound as fun as I describe them, but all I know is that besides Talk Soup, the only other two shows I watched consistently over these years, The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O 'Brian. So if you like comedy stylings of these shows, then you will probably like Talk Soup during Sparks years. <br /> <br /> Having said that, Henson and Tyler were both good hosts as well. All three hosts brought something different to the table, but they were all fine comedians in my opinion. Of course in the whole Tyler and guest star, my interest in this show began to fall, but now and then I take The Soup, the show's spiritual successor, and certainly the new host can bring some rather unexpected laughs from time to time. OK, I have wasted enough time talking about a TV show that is no longer in the air and on a channel that I generally despise. Go see something else!
