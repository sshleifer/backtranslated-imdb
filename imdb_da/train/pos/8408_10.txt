"It wasn't me! It was, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby says to Dugan when he is confronted by being at Sally's place. I've used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best books for pure fun and non-credibility. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan, so much so that in 1978 he was "Malibu Beach" the same character (not so much time on the screen). "No one calls Dugan a bastard!" is another line of the times. This classic movie was definitely worth the admission fee.
