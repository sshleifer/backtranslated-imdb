I've never been huge on IMAX movies. They are cool, but when you come across the first rush of "Whoa, it feels like flying!" The films themselves are usually quite corny and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exceptions have been the powerful "Everest", the exciting "Wild California" and now the BBC's "The Human Body", a super-big look on the inside of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of a complexity that are simply unthinkable. This 50 minute movie could be 10 hours long and will still not come to all the systems working in tandem, just as I write this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all too well. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (resembling a foreign spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs of your eardrum that treat sound, the development of a baby in a mother's womb and surprisingly a few of the ... um, less attractive features that I thought it would turn away from (pimples, surrender of acids in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This movie Also, it has a pretty funky style for it that separates it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, have we all seen semen that finds its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it tuned to the tune of Marvin Gaye's "Let's get it on"? It's creative moments like what makes the "human body" not just a health lesson, but also fun.
