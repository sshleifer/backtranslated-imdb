Mel Torme and Victor Borge serve in their younger years to make this movie interesting - and especially to see a young Sinatra on the sunny side of 30 and certainly convey that this was his "yes, I am a popular singer, but hardly a actress yet "scene. Michele Morgan is an annoying, eerie presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been completely lost to me. Leon Erroll is stupid, as always, but generally quite fun. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right "class" because with the combination of the positive aspects along with the lack of a great story and a stupid on it and the above mentioned irritations - it is overall average at best. Most of the fascination is from displaying the three entertainment icons in their early years.
