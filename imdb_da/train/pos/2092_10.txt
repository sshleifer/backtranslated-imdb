I watched this movie with a little curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I got away from the movie thinking YES! After seeing Muni in only one movie where he was completely hammy, I expected the same type of performance here. I was happily proved wrong. Although some might criticize him for being too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians, I thought he was just in the role. Keye Luke, if he had the chance to play a leading role, could have played him the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with the camera's work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the Palace of the Palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphical and ugly atmosphere of the burning group and the drought made this an epic right that was no different from the same time when it was all glitz and glitter. I saw this movie from start to finish enchanted. I can't say the same thing about "epics" today.
