Beautiful movie with a good soundtrack that spans the rock landscape in the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation describing life in a small village near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), it describes the lives of young people and their problems in relation to the world. It is reminiscent of Trainspotting, with a bit of Italian touch.
