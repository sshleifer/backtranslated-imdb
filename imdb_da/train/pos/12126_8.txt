Bette Davis turns in a cold entertaining performance like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 movie. The film seems quite dated now in 2003. It is undoubtedly worth watching movie traitors and Bette Davis fans, but can't have as much appeal to the average movie guards today. It was spectacular for me to see how young Mrs Davis looks like this. The actors turn into performances that are basically obedient, and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well-cast as Philip Carey, the soccer-born doctor. This is a movie with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. But "Of Human Bondage" did not seem to have a strong influence on me mentally or emotionally. I felt a little indifferent and detached about the movie after seeing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction the director was on. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
