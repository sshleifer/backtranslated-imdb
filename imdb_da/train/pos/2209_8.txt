In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity shit show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said so. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, I would sometimes wish that Greg Kinnear hadn't left. If you ask me, it seems that no one stays with a TV show throughout his race anymore. Still, I enjoyed watching the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities. If you ask me, it was quite fun fun. Before I unpack this, I have to say that I kind of miss this show. In conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all your dying sketch show fans. You really want to enjoy it.
