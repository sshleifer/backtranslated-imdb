Firstly, I would like to rectify another review of this film, which said that the last musical winning the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. It's misinformation like 'West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the following year. That said, this movie is amazing! The story from the novel has changed somewhat, but it's more because of the limitations they had at a stage that they just didn't switch back to a filmed version. But I don't mind. In fact, I'd rather think the whole production is flowing better than the novel does. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are those that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr Bumble and Mrs. Bumble are starting to come out from the governor's office. The study for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this movie were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is much better than he is in the book) and Shani Wallis, who is it strongest, most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers, which are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy.' I always hate when the choreography of musical musicals is meant to look like people who do everyday lists and jobs. It looks terrible and cheesy, especially when they dance at London Meat Co. They should just have done regular choreography for these scenes. But this movie is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully forever.
