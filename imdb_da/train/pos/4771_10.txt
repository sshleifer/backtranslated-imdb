The Zenith of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, crafted a delicate and exquisite story about the most unlikely premise. A man travels to see his brother-in-law. He has no other means of transport, and he takes on a lawnmower over six weeks. Richard Farnsworth, in his last film, delivers a fantastic layered and nuanced performance in the lead. Straight Story is beautifully beautiful in its decoration of little things, and it is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed. Sissy Spacek is known as Farnsworth's daughter, a weakened medieval woman who lives with the loss of her children.
