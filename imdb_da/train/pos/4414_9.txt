Cuban blood is one of the sleeping movies that has much to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually looked at it while I was sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution to the end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's age and the conditions that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A movie with fine-tuning and controlling. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects or big schemes or true phrases. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie worth seeing several times a year.
