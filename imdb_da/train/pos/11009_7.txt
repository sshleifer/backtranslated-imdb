There was a stylish approach to this movie by director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu leading roles and expanding their range as artists. This movie also featured one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. The director's and actor's efforts combined in an effective thriller. Although the movie's plot was distorted, the story became very clear when the corporate greed and skullduggery teams were revealed. <Br /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell proposed in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state that would control minds and reduce human freedom. Interestingly, in this exciting futuristic movie, it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
