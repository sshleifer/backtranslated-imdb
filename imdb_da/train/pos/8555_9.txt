* Firstly, although many say it's the worst of the series, I don't think it's true, considering the idea of ​​the 21st century teenage mentality. It provides perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have had the same fun as the characters do. <br /> <br /> * I agree that it's a teen movie, but comedy movies today aren't meant to be teenagers? I mean ... cinemas are pretty much the place for teens to hang out; Plus seeing such a movie under a sleeper or such is very good to have a very good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's be real ... doesn't it reflect teenage guys' thoughts like those from the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic stuff? it is not at all what would be in these teenagers' minds ... <br /> <br /> * Finally, I think if you are a teenager, you should definitely watch the movie and even if you are a real adult man or a woman, you should see if you still have a teenage content, or you often think about how it was teenager or things as such. Thanks for reading!
