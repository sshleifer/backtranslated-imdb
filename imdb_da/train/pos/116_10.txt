Man oh man ... I have been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there is a long list!) To watch this movie and finally got the chance to do it. And "news" is: Marvelous labyrinthine plays! For every Von Trier's "supporter": both Rigets, Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, Five Obstructions, etc. ... Europe is probably the difference for its greatness in visual terms. Everything is beautifully gloomy and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being in this "imaginary" nightmare time warp. While recording from masters of surrealistic cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, until noir films from the 40s with sour drops of avant-guard Von Trier leads the art film scene as the "well-appointed totalitarian" film producer today. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complicated problems without being irrational is hitting the viewer's nerve with the purpose of healing some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. As utopian as it seems, I think people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. Today's films and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer needed as a tool for reflection, perhaps it may be the start of a new era: "The time, emotional control over our fears". This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
