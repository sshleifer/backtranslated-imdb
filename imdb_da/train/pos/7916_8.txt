Well, well .... Touching a bit of a nerve there, didn't it? He was a genius while cataloging his various characters' descent into psychosis for a few decades, but as soon as he has the bad taste of suggesting that redemption (or even some good advice) can be found in the bad old Catholic Church, the hip -end-you-alternative movie amount becomes extra malicious. Even worse, Theresa Russell's character - faces experience that nothing in her formally rationalist view has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with these experiences on another level - the spiritual. You know, the ignorant and superstitious wealth, the kind of things that the cinephiles of the art house must be over. Oh, horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it can be an unequivocally important engagement - affirmed by what seems unpleasant as divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive may be wondering why they instinctively go into attack mode by being challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably won't. Sure, this movie has some problems, especially the Talia Shire's delirious hamwork like the overwhelmed nun, 1950s clothing and everything. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom with impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst). But unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have copped a critical mauling so much to ask the question of the possible answers this film presents itself.
