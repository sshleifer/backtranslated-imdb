This is probably Karisma at her best, except for Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives her best, without even trying. The story is very good at times, but at the end seems to draw, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really was to me as it was the manager's ideas, the dialogonism and the story of what it was. It could have been corrected and edited. The support case was just as great, including Karima's sister-in-law, even though she just had a shining moment, it was great to see her. The sets were also pretty good. I didn't really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but when they enter India, it's just as true as it gets. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give it a thumbs up!
