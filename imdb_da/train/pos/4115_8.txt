This is one of the weirder movies I've seen recently. This is because it resembles a movie and more like an experimental movie. The Kurasawa experiment was to take a number of people living in a garbage waste and weave their experiences into a wallpaper that gives a glimpse of their generally harsh existence. Not all episodes are depressing and hard, but in general it is clearly the tone. Let's see ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempted murder, concourse, alcoholism, adultery, a small boy's death after eating pre-melted fish, a man with severe depression (he never speaks under the film and looks a lot scary), a hopeless dream that would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street image and uses all his waking moments to "drive" his street car through paths between the trash cans, a man married to an overall shrink (I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!) etc. etc. In fact, it is depressing enough that it almost resembled an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan when Bergman made many movies there tend to deal with mental illness and hopelessness in life. Is it weird that Kurasawa tried to kill himself after making this movie? Then I liked it? No. It was not a fun experience. But it was a very well-made film that certainly kept my attention, and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was like watching a train wreck - you don't want to see all the carnage, but you can't stop seeing! Of all the vignettes, I think that the older man who used to look out for everyone and who didn't really seem to fit in (he was too well-adjusted and wise to live in a garbage waste) might have to represent Kurasawa himself. Maybe. I do not have it. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a wide range of Kurasawa movies and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this a watch. But do NOT make your first experience watching his movie - it is safe to scare away many viewers!
