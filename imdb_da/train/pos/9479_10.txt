Tian's remake is not good at all. I just click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic film from 1948 saying a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the show by Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her cameo appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise to her fans. In this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic movie, and Wei Weis still shot from the film is seen everywhere in Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 this year, is surprised Wei Wei was so beautiful then.
