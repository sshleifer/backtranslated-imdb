There have been far too few mainstream films in post-colonial Africa and those who have a mixed group. This, with its altruistic preaching to reveal slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa that do not prove to be too different for human values ​​as a whole. It also lacks in view of the unreasonable influence of Western preconceptions on Africans and especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African-American wife of English physician David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy. The leading slave trader, Suleiman, is every stage Arabic, with its thriving and sometimes humorous rhetoric and movements that match each other - which would not be out of place on "Carry On Follow that Camel" but is not up to the standard movie deserve. Of course, Peter Ustinov had more than enough skills to cope with some of the shortcomings of the manuscript, and he saved what might otherwise have been an unhappy one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing the stereotypical theme, all three of Suleiman's Arabic employees are unintentional and have pedophile tendencies toward the boy, who fortunately are not depicted on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first gates is the local police officer, a stereotypically pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed race relationships who initially refuse to help unless David pays in front. Won of David's love for Anansa, and conscious of his own inability to find love, he goes in to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa. They find Suleiman and his prisoner crossing the border and cannot pursue them to the adjacent area. Due to Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down, but David survives. <br /> <br /> We then see David introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by revenge. They find the Sanufu girl with a group of Tuareg and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, they kill a party of slave traders only to find it was not Suleiman's group and have no choice but to send their prisoners to the Tuaregs they met earlier . <br /> <br /> Later, we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an Outstanding scene of supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen. Anansa, on the other hand - and despite the boy's skepticism - manages to manipulate Suleiman's two other employees. <br /> <br /> At this time, Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market. <Br /> <br /> Suleiman, now undoubtedly Anansa is "trouble", is trying to sell her to an indecent wealthy Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. After discovering that Anansa is an American working for the United States, the Prince immediately decides uncertainly to continue the negotiations without considering the consequences. In the slave market, the young boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile and we are back to guessing whether those boys will still be considered "wunderable" when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctorate. -skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bittersweet conclusion from Malik's point of view. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, David and Anansa are reunited, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can consolidate having seen the task he set in motion. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the movie is excellent, but it loses marks for its stereotypical depiction of almost all the leading characters. Credit must go to all the leading players to solve many of the shortcomings in scripting.
