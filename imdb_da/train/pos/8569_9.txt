This is as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, the Cruella steals the show with its outrageous behavior and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see much more of her this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the pretty bumbling male lead. Using Paris as the climax of the movie was a smart idea. The movie is worth seeing regardless of your age, provided you like animals.
