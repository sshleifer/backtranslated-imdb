"Capitães de Abril" is a very good one. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The story of history is not of great interest, but it does not destroy the film. Captain Salgueiro Maia's heroic actions are not exaggerations and the film is also a tribute to his works. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes in the April 25 Revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Do not miss it! I liked this movie a lot.
