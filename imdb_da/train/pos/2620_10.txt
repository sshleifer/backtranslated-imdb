What a pleasant surprise: A Disney DTV (Direct to Video) sequel that is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair involving everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts by watching the original movie and commenting until Timon complains that "we're not here yet". After fighting over the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie and the laughs begin. To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of their direct-to-ticket fare has been aggressively awful, with the story lines desperate to deposit on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: It tells the original story from a new point of view. Okay, it adds some things that Timon came from and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella immediately resume the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie. There are also some nice movie scenes (including a scene that simultaneously spoofs 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Cool Hand Luke'), and the script is filled with fun memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added To The Cast is Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's worried mother, and Jerry Stills as Timon's little crazy uncle Max. Matthew Broderick shows up as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone does it well, especially Robert Guillame (is it how you spell it?) Like Rafiki, which radiates more and more Yoda figures in this movie (Timon comments this several times). "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a perfect alternative for those of you who get tired of the animation
