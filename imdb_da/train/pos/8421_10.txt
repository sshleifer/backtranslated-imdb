Josef von Sternberg leads this magnificent silent film about quiet Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Russian tsar who has found himself there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, partly for his role as the general, which ironically is thrown in a bit on a quiet image as a Russian general. The film flashes back to his days in Russia, leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut as a Hollywood director who throws Janning in his movie. The movie serves as an interesting look at Russia's fall and after an imitation of the back scenes Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
