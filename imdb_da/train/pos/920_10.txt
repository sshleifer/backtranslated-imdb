This cute animated card features two comics - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is the bald, somewhat portly boy from the comics who never speaks. <br /> <br /> Now he speaks! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he gets left to the store - some hilarious haninks come. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets Henry comes in battle with birds and a monkey, but everything goes out eventually.
