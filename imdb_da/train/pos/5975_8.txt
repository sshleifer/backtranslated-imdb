Every film critic and metalhead hated this movie, but I enjoyed it. I saw this as a child on television somewhere and was amazed at the scene where Sammi comes on stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typically the 80's, guy being pushed by bullies and listening to supernatural help to look up the bullies, but goes a long way and needs to be destroyed. Matt from Melrose Place chooses on Skippy from Family Ties, so Skippy gets an overview of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks, the highlight is where Tony sings (lip sync) and dances to a metal song before shit frames tab. <br /> <br /> There were many faults, but the music and the overall picture were enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
