This movie told me so much that I see it at least once a year. At times I find it uncomfortable. At times I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. It's a movie that shows you the lively reality of life in LA, starting with the recurring helicopter charts that scan for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary life worn by the characters. It is also a movie that shows you how the alien's kindness can change your life and allow you to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that any action you take, whether calculated or not, has strong consequences. I found this movie to look like Robert Altman's Short Cuts movie in many ways. Both had a star-studded roster of perfect cast actors and actresses, and both films allowed you to gradually see how the characters interlinked and influenced each other for better or worse. The Grand Canyon did a better job of giving a coherent message (hoping in the rugged reality) than Altman's film, although I found them both exciting in their own way. This movie is a definite must see !!!
