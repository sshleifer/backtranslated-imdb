This is not a deep film; Most of the plot aspects are quite predictable and "tried and true", but it was well-acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "error" as the movie calls them) as we look back over our lives. I hadn't read the book, so did not know much more than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories of the side that she has not really participated with anyone. Fortunately, they got a shelf .... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays the young Lilac and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie as the old Lilac ... besides a great resemblance (duh!) made the younger actor a good job (maybe not quite up to her mother's caliber, but who is it?) Everybody else in this movie was fine, although I wish there was more of Glen Close and thought The Buddy character was a little too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more of a girls movie than the boys, but a good one to see with your mother or daughter and maybe start a dialogue. How hard is it to know a parent really as a "person"!
