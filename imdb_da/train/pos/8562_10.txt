I liked it! The reason was weird, Drew Barrymore and DC compilation were awkward for both of them. Drew's dealings were risky in places, but it could be down in her life at that time. Dennis Christopher who shrunk was pretty cool, and as always he does his best - I am still a big Dennis fan, and therefore I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I didn't get the end! The weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked like it was out of the film school, which is OK I guess, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and everything with the knife - if it was so uncomfortable, why didn't they get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing when it was Doppelanger's weird stuff, or when it was DC or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenarios with Patrick, if it was Dennis as the Doppelganger, then I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was OK, but intrusive in places the whole orchestral stage seemed to revolve around a theme, but this theme was overdone. <br /> <br /> A great blend of lots of blood and free shot of Drew nude. <br /> <br /> All in all, a GPM Guilty Pleasure Movie. Don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and a great script because you don't find it. There are some diamond moments and goofs to a great extent - watch it and just have a good fun with it!
