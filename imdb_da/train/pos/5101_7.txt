John Travolta, the world's largest honkeytonk and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yes, you will probably not get many surprises or deep meaning in this. Still, I have always found it quite pleasant to see this redneck romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you can expect a hardcore redneck couple to have. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bullfighting, and - of course - the required brawls. It has a good 1980 soundtrack with "Lust for love in all the wrong places", "The devil went down to Georgia" and "Hi Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break out your cowboy boots and get a boot-scootin 'boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
