The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a tram clacking on the rails. It is metaphorical for everything that the people who live in the dump cannot have. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passing tram representing the middle class's relatively unattainable rich life. The little boy's pathos and his beloved, unfortunately, crazy father are most touching. This was Kurosawa's first film in color and he uses beautifully shocking shades, colors seen only in dreams. The film is surreal and transcends beauty. Compassion for humanity is the underlying force, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of a genius of cinema.
