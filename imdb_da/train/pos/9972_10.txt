This is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that the "left side is now attached to the right." Like the original, this film shines against a federal government that transcends its limits on personal freedom. It is a warning of how troubled our political freedoms are in an era of a supreme and superior federal government. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, along with the ordinary media, spoke of words such as "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists and trumped up drug charges to mitigate the most fundamental of its" civil rights, with the willingness of the general population. This message is so non-pc, I am stunned that this movie could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS down to the decision makers as they did to Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, Western Journalism Center and countless others who dared talk. "Live Free or Die" is the motto of Jason Priestly's hat when he brilliantly portrays the "voice" and it sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this movie. <br /> <br />
