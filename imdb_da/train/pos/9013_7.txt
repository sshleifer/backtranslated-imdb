Although this movie has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose it because of the cast and welcomed Bonham Carter and Branagh to choose roles that differ from those they have previously taken. Both depict very troubled people, complete with warts, but make them sympathetic because of their humanity. History touches, but it is the notion that floats. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement if the quest for romance opened its eyes to aspects of being disabled, which I hadn't thought of before, but also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the movie ended too suddenly, but better than a pronounced emotionally manipulative ending (see "Stepmom.") The very real English attitude added to my pleasure - it was England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without Be depressing.
