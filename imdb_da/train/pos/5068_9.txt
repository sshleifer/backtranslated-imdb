This movie is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in the 1930s Canada. I found it as accurate and cordial as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It captures late into Gray Owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Canadian Indian staircase advancing the crowded Beaver. He also predicts the fall in natural areas and overuse of the earth's resources. This is a monstrous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The molding of Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange, but is not scandalous. Anyone who wants to argue for this point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan gives a fantastic performance as it does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural to the compulsory connections of the latest Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenes or environmental reasons. It is also a movie for families, but children under the age of 10 (depending on maturity) will have trouble following the plot.
