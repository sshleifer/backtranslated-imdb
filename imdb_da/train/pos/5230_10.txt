In fact, I liked this movie very much. Not because of his plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it because it is one of the worst movies ever created. It's so paralyzed, so bad it gets terribly fun. Some jokes are cool, but the rest makes me ask for the scriptwriter's job. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
