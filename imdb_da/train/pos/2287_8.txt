This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I have never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper" then it is. Great writing, production and action. I highly recommend it to the public who wants some consideration. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was this movie no longer made?
