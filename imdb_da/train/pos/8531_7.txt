Although the plot was a bit juicy at times and much hurried at the end, as if the director had run out of time and had to hurry up and finish the story, it was generally pretty good for the Made-For-Backwood's Cable TV genre. <br /> <br /> But the actor who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of her around in filmland. The music was also well done so you could chill out dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think JAWS) on music-based tension buildup. I don't think I want to see "While the kids sleep" again, but if I did, it would be to focus on the talented Klaveno's performance.
