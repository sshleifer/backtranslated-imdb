Most of the comments have been positive, but I would add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer used many beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention to. The film is driven by characterization and symbolism, which is very rich. All the gangster actors were thrown - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialogue was entertaining at times, but sometimes styled, and I suppose it was supposed to be that way. This is a movie buffs movie. It was made by humans, for people who love the medium. Don't miss this one.
