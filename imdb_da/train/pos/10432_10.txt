I must admit that at the beginning I was kind of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid, small, romantic movie about a French woman meeting in the train an American and deciding to visit Vienna with him. In fact, I was not enchanted by this kind of script as it continued to make me believe it was just a movie. Still I saw it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical way and wonder about the fact that at the moment of our birth we are doomed to death or that It is an intermediate idea that a couple should rest together for eternity, or what we humans can afford sometimes to live in adventure. <br /> <br /> The finish was wonderfully selected (we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock in Vienna's station) - in our optimism we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good way, so I began to believe that I could live a love story right here.
