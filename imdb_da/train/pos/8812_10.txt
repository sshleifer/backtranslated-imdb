I saw this series as it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the movie, where two men came together and told a director from each country to lead a movie around 911. These directors never met before the project was finished and they saw what it looked like. WARNING: SPOILERS AWAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial. If you're American, then you don't like this, as some of the pieces can be found anti-American. But I know a few Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece I found best was that of India. It was about how a Muslim family living in the states had 2 sons, and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed he was associated with the terrorist bombing. It catches the mothers despair and humiliation of these accusations so well that it brought tears to their eyes. Finally, we see that her son was dead while trying to rescue the many victims of the tower's crash. This was a true story, and that was what made it so right. There were many emotional and strong pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humorous yet just as powerful as the others. A must see for everyone, and hopefully America will lift this and let it play in their country.
