Ten of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (I found only the Egyptian one disappointing). Stragely chose the Mexican director only to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, eagles in Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, the coup of Pinochet and consequent bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the United States, old people living alone and the succession of 2. world war in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This may say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways: the directors can feel that the Americans ignore the world's other pains and only care about their own tragedies while effectively doing the same with their short films. <br /> Surprisingly, I found Sean Penn's piece one of the very best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also guess his portrayal of Ernest Borgnine as a half-skirt old man who vegetera In a New York apartment, the happiest moment of his widow's life, when the sun shines through the window after the WTC, "collapses out of the light", I also think this could also be one of the most offensive of the general American audience would see it.
