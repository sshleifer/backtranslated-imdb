If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists your gut, don't worry, you can still see and love The Ghost Train, like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, it's a movie that is simply too horrible to be sunk by a single performance, even that of the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it is because I go into her world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake many people make. Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't think of it without being amazed by the deep, dark world it transports you to, it is immersive in a way of getting cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be in desperate early '40s and it's a movie I could imagine that few people have ever seen the only time. The cast is, without exception, exceptionally good, maybe the Trench relieves it a bit thick, but unlike a lonely railway station in wartime she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out. The lovely passage of the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie, and now it's really in the past, but is patiently waiting for us to play games.
