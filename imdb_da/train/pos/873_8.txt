I saw this movie not expecting much and didn't know much about it. I loved it. A very good, tight plot, an exciting hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without hurrying. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than the same director De battre mon coeur s'est aret√©, which was boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that didn't work out was that the apparently ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: firm, safe and far from conventionally beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen every time she was on it. Superb. I wish she was in more movies and better than she generally is. I've seen a bit of Gilles' wife and a bit of cross-hairs, and they both looked like garbage, and I've seen all of you better, and that's definitely nonsense. She seems to have a couple coming up, so I keep my fingers crossed.
