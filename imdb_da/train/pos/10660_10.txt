I found this movie to be exciting almost from the get-go. When Miss Stanwyck starts her story, it is only a few minutes until you realize that problems are coming. The deserted area that the lock on the deserted gas station dies, all sets you up waiting for it ... here it comes. First, you think it's about the little boy, but too early you start to breathe and see the tide. I found this movie to be really stressful even though I had seen it before and was prepared for the denouement. Now, a movie that can keep you excited, even when you've seen it before you deserve some sort of special rating, maybe a white knuckle's price?
