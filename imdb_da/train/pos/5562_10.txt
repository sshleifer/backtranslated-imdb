This has the fun jokes out of all Cheech & Chong flicks. It's the first thing I saw with these guys. I found it really good. My dad actually recommended me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLE MODEL, and my GRANDMA actually bought it for me, knowing how it was. Which family do I have. Now this movie is pretty good and good to rent when you want to see a good classic. I have to warn you, it's not gut-busting fun. It has its moments but not as fun as there is about Mary. Check it anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you are an anti-drug activist or something.
