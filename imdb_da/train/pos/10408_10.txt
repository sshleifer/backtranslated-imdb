I first saw this movie when I was a young child and fell in love with it all at once. The sets breathe, and some of the manuscript is damn hilarious: "You sons of a thousand fleas". <br /> <br /> It always appears on television late at night or really early in the morning, I woke up at 3:00 am once and it was just beginning. Television companies need to show a little more respect and put it on first-class Sunday, so everyone can get a chance to see this fine work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
