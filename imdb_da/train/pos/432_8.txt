I only saw this because the star Josie Lawrence, whom I knew <br /> <br /> from Whose Line, is it anyway ?, the crazy British improvisation <br /> <br /> comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised at this heart-warming and magical gem. It's uplifting, touching and <br /> <br /> romantic without being juicy or sentimental. The characters are all real people, with real feelings, fears and needs. See it.!
