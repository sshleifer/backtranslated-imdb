I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was truly amazing in this movie. The emotions she must have gone through, taking resumption after resumption, do not just think about. This was a very difficult movie to see, the subject is definitely uncomfortable, and you feel so helpless, just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity. In fact, I felt it all went wrong when her friends came back to the house, and I didn't find that conclusion at all. The director seemed very keen to use height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections, I think he should have paid more attention to the pace of the second half of this piece. I'm sure this is a strong piece of theater, this movie for me, even though it made a profit, just fell short.
