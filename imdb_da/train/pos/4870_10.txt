The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world sets itself apart from innocent and pure souls, and everything has "Happy End," as in the film's final scene. <br /> <br /> The movie features wonderful soundtracks, mix of Serbian neo-folk, gypsy music and jazz. This film is very refreshing piece of visual poetry. Look at the experience is like you I have been sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes raw world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Coastal movie must be the movie.
