**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize it's hard to destroy a historical documentary, but I reveal some of the backstory and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary documentary not only because of the remarkable recording, but also because of the story behind it. Because Naudets did not sit down to tell the story of 9/11, but rather that of a rookie firefighter, men's feelings and viewers' connection with them is more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a cinematic sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, they would be great as the characters are established, then throw a curve to respond to. This is the more amazing in view of the pain and feeling of the raw admission that the directors had to go through to tie this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie gives a glimpse of life inside a fire station; specifically how a beginner assimilates to a herd of veterans. This part alone is quite good, and if the documentary was allowed to run its planned course, it would probably have been solid. The brothers seem to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Of course, hell breaks loose. The chaos that follows the WTC attacks is seen alive, as various characters we've come to know are highlighted in frightening situations. Seeing not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human feeling. <br /> <br /> The aftermath, where firefighters are discovered to be lost and found, is human drama at its peak. Life and death are in the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer can not only know who wants to live and die, but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative I have to say about this is that Robert DeNiro (who I like) blurbs was uninformative, unnecessary and did not speed up the story at all. They were probably added just to attract more television viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareil portraits of raw human feeling and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
