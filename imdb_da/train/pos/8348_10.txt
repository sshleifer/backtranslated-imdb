About 1986 I saw this movie by accident on a night. I was 6 years old. It looked like my unintentional display of the scary end not to look now in 1987. I went to Venice on vacation the next year in silent terror and hoped for god that my parents would not find out I had seen it! <br /> <br /> Would I have thought if my parents knew I had seen Les Valseuses when I was a kid? I would probably avoid the issue with my father even today and my mother is probably not approved in the afterlife. I don't know if they want to see it anyway. From stalking and catching a woman in the apartment block in the first scene to slide down the mountain roads with glazed worn eyes, I'm never sure if this movie is an insensitive piece of garbage that ignores the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy one Liberating movies to watch as it starts with you that you can never be so offensive yourself. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely violent. It has a violent view of gender, almost no recognition of love. Even sucking a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual exploitation act. But the scenario is very erotic and (god I'm so British) awakens! Do they suck her breasts for themselves? It's exploitation. So why do I get a woody? The fellows are hunting for an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother figure? I do not know. It ends in a really cruel suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson who has cannibal holocaust guts and he went eeuurrgghh! No motherly love for this movie, on the contrary. Mutilation of where the boys began. Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Do women have to be punished so they learn what is right from men? <br /> <br /> I think of two movies, of which I wish I had never seen, the other made me want it It is not such a hard world. Very away / Madonna, what a pile of mental illness does not calculate, has never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave to man, and it is perhaps Madonna who says any respectable guy, I am so furious I can't use punctuation! Once in America / Leone god why does noodles do it? Destroying the road to joy we have followed him throughout his life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but plenty of sex and nudity in abundance of both sexes. Very honest, no titillation. No fantasy shags, no perfect Hollywood smooth movements. Witnesses, yes. But there is too much dark and jealousy and trickery here to call it a sex comedy. Forget to continue shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg Cos she comes back and you will hang her up with your ex-con lover's avenging son and she will learn to come with him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can't stand are rape film and prison film. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, nobody wants to see it now! It's a brilliant movie!
