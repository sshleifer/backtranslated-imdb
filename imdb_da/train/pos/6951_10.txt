I was never a big fan of TV until I saw 24 for the first time. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was a series 3 episode that was on my parents' DVR (digital video recorder) box while sitting in the house over the weekend. It took one episode for me to be hooked and sink into Jack Bauer's world. And boy was I connected !! I saw the next six episodes without blinking in the eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly card for twenty dollars and it was unnecessary to say that it has been the biggest explosive I've ever used. I saw the first three seasons in three weeks. It's 72 forty minute episodes !!! I would say finding out what's happening next is easier on DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine the expectation to see season 6 week to week !! I find it mildly torture and cruel, but I will give it a try and see it like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I will be chomping on the bit !!
