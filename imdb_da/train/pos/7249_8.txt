It is difficult for me to award the "fair" number of stars to this movie, but I turned to 8 because of its high production values ​​and what was an innovative approach to the war movie in 1968. Also, remember that I haven't seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vibrant anti-war films ever made. It achieves this by simply exhibiting in very realistic terms acts of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No film before this showed war on the infantry group's level with so much brutal detail, and all in a cold, eerie way that allowed the actions to speak for themselves. There is no sermon, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar clichés. As an "entertainment" film does not, even though it was clearly not meant to "entertain". It was supposed to swallow you over the head with misery and horror in World War II and modern war in general. It was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before Spare Private Ryan, both of which are far more "watchable" movies. Here are the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and the realistic unpleasant images (including what may be the first on the screen vomit in theater history) that the movie is hard to pass, even though it's only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you get when it's over, a bonus star for having his heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Just as Carl Foreman is undervalued "The Victors", an equally slim but more interesting and thought-provoking movie, The Long Day's Dying doesn't seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been on cable a number of times.
