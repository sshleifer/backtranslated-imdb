Warning: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie and are planning to do so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to watch this movie. I've seen it four times so far, and I still haven't thought about what just happened in the movie. That's all I have to say, because if you haven't seen this movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you still read, I will ask you some questions and maybe someone has some answers, you can email me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my class 11 English teacher pretty well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise over his years, and he always had this ruthless way to teach you things that you might not be too keen on. If we didn't like Shakespeare, he transformed the story into a modern romance with modern language so we could understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage, and we were on the lake and read a book at our own leisure. This was his own indelible way of branding something in our spongy mind. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us a task that has been etched in my mind as the phone number of a long lost best friend, and It finally made some sense for me after seeing The Matrix. Now if I didn't know better, I'd have thought that the Wachowski brothers were just an alias for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But to give them the benefits of the doubt, we assume it wasn't him. But it was the first time this task was anything more than impossible. <br /> <br /> He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that it was genuine. Show me how you can tell that you are genuine. This made the class clear all the usual ideas that I am sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, sense of touch to sense of loss to feeling hunger was sprayed to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After each scenario we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you're other than someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What is a messy question? This was a question / scenario asked to us about 15 years ago before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid acceleration of computers. How could it work then? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself what you were part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal film this year explored David Lynch's Mulholland Drive similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other movie could hope for. In short, it is a movie that literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, fair, full of self publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father, and although he has talent and business-specific, his board of directors, the seven dwarfs, seems to be a rich thinker born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the top of the success that each of them thinks should go to them. Early in the film, we meet one of David's beautiful toys, Julie Gianni, which is played with horrible but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are only there to use each other and are not the least bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is the type of relationship that is related to David's other flings he has had in his sexual sense of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can tell that only one really tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Next, meet Brian Shelby, who plays with a brilliant blow by Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that David has to publish, but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little in his life, and you can feel genuine care for each other early in the movie. Brian has a famous line that he keeps telling about David over and over. And it is "the sweet is not so sweet without the bitter." He continues to tell him that someday he will find true love and not just this period of love, as he seems to commit with all the floozies in his bed for one night or two. <br /> <br /> On David's great birthday base, (so huge that Steven Spielberg wants him a happy birthday) Brian goes with his date, Sofia Sorrano, of course by Penelope Cruz with what should be the best performance this year of a actress. This is just a bash after invitation and initially David and Sofia seem to be fascinated with each other. And in the typical David fashion, even though his best friend is there, he starts flirting with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie shows intruders and starts spying on David. David spends the night with Sofia, but they only speak and draw cartoons of each other. There is no hanky panky. The next day, when David leaves Sofia's apartment, he is met by Julie, offering him a ride and from there ....... yes, I think we have all seen the advertisements. <br /> <br /> That's all I really want to say about the plot, because from here the film tells us what is real and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters, all of which play a role in this maze as a drop. There is a subtitle of death and possible panacea-like healing, which may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the exciting opportunities that the film offers us, but it doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> Like many movies seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense may have begun this craze, but look even further back and you may thank Angel Heart for starting lazy. No matter how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitive gut busters. And what makes this so fun is that the film gives you many clear traces along the way, but not enough to give you an apodetic solution to the truth and lie you've just put yourself through. I've seen this movie four times, and every time it's been because I want to see if there's anything else I can download, something more I can understand. To think of the theater so that it can open up new opportunities, it is rarely in a movie. All ersatz so-called "Best Pictures of the Year" have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A beautiful mind was exciting, but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a movie that leaves you yearning for more, but guarantees your satisfaction because the movie and those who did not care about it. I know this movie has received mixed reviews, but I just think those who don't like it don't quite understand it. <br /> <br /> That's what movie making should be like. That's how a movie should do for you. It must make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one is not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 Best of the Year movie. I would love to see this nominated for the best picture, and I would love to see Cruz for Best Actress, Diaz for Best Support, Cruise for Best Actor and Jason Mewes should be a best supporting actress shoe. Cameron Crowe should be there too. None of this can happen and it is a shame. This is a movie that must not be missed. <br /> <br /> And finally, I'm absolutely sure that Mr. Krisak would like this movie, and maybe it's the only movie to answer his question. Can you prove that you are genuine? Or are we just a figure of a person's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for others' bemusement? This is a movie that jumps more questions than it answers. And I'm sure it's just fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
