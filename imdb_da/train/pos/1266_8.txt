I read some previous comments that say this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and that it also has a similar end to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'm going to give a simple review to the normal movie guests out there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris best performances. What an evil psychopath !!! I have great respect for his acting after seeing his performance in this movie. I was ridden throughout this movie. If you like mysterious thrillers, then this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!
