It was only by my second impression, many years later, that I realized two things about this movie: 1) I enjoyed it immensely, and 2) its because its execution is certainly sharper than the assumption itself guarantees. I had laughed through the movie before it happened to me to renew my first protests - valleys and loogies and airheadedness (even * good * -developed airheadedness) are just not intrinsically fun, especially when pulled out to length. But even though the film's momentum begins to sputter toward the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comic book throughout that even the more lumpy writings (eg Ted lacking Recognition of a particular inhabitant of hell) works as effortlessly as the whiter (for example, the challenge). And the connection between Winter and Reeves clicks so well that Billing and Ted (who only use a scene separated throughout the movie, disaster if they are not well-tuned) look completely unpunished. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found the first movie only occasionally entertaining - very different comic feelings it seems.) <br /> <br /> I give it a 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
