Paul (Jason Lee) is a subordinate who is only involved in a type-A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little too full and ends up taking a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back to his graves. "Nothing has happened" as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. She's on her way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul needs Becky out of the place even though her underpants are left behind. But there is even more fun in front. At a family dinner at Kar's parental home, Paul runs again in Becky and learns that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explaining to do! But instead, Paul chooses to celebrate a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? And what will the consequences be? I'm sorry critics who pan movies like this. They should definitely light up because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, it doesn't matter that Lee is a complete fun man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is a natural as a beautiful but anal fiance. The rest of the casting, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also pretty nice. The look of the movie is wonderful, like costumes and California options. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired and creates a great laugh for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the funny funny bones, get this movie tonight. It may not be Academy Award material, but it is definitely guaranteed to make a bad day a good good.
