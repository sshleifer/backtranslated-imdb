Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times tells how it is a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I don't think it's the meaning of the movie at all. The film parodyes the spikes (criminals who drove the blackmarket) and the housewife league, which fought against government restrictions, but was truly a Tory front organization. Yes, of course, the film sends out the political / social situation but ultimately the people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a just society, they will be British and confuse rather than foreign. <br /> <br /> But I don't think they go back to being just as they were before.
