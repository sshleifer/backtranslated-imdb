Wealthy Psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just released her first novel and feels down to her profession that feels hopelessly helping her patients. A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay his debts if he really wants to help him get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal more of the plot would destroy a hell of a fun movie and the 'House of Games' may well be the best con movie I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem, full of cunning dialogues, large one-liners and enough twists to keep you guessing at the end. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needs a change, and Mantegna tops her as the devilish sweet king. And with the exception of one case in the film's last quarter, the film is in full control of that audience; And we love love. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
