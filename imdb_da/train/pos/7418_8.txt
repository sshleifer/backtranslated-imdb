"Shower" is a story of loyalty, of the unstoppable progress of the modern world at the expense of rather traditional and more human life forms. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his big-city life, his wife and his late-night brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what to do. Modern China against the old. The public baths with its collections, its cricket are struggling with shopping malls and skyscraper. Lots of old men and women who are no longer needed. China, a country, two systems that Xiao Ping said ... even if one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, move, filled with fun moments and bittersweet. The sensitive ones will cry and laugh straight. The actors are huge, especially the one performing the retarded boy's role; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy and simple, so the story just flows by itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
