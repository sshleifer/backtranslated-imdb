Sublimity is the way we should reach The Beauty. And sublimity are the things this movie is made of. If it's not his best, it's my most beloved of all Bogdanovich movies. <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. As the song from which the films take their title (Gershwin's well-known composition), the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that no one is able to judge anyone; all this with the light of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a dialogue line constructed on the characters' appearance and views - with the "Bogdanovich touch" based on the point of -view - is a class at Cinema Language, something that PB learned well from his admired directors from the film's golden age). With a stunning cast and a brilliant soundtrack (including the best of Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film deserves full of self-awareness and compassion and far from complacency and emptiness (as some critics wrote) a better place on American cinema history than where it has been placed. It is not "long in style, short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
