Presentation of Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a sweet movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is fantastic as always, but some scenes in the movie do not work, and the romance between her and van Heflin develops too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, a minute he's ready to beat his beard, but next time he'll fall in love with her. I think this production, movie editing and script (although the photography was great, the scenery was nice and the costumes were good too) could have been a little better. It feels as if the production was too fast. <br /> <br /> The support support was also good, especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie. She at age 11 looks really cute, and it's a shame she didn't turn into a teenage comic actress. She's much better in this movie than in her previous movies like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for the 1938 Broadway Musketeers, she's really good at it) when they tried to make her a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. Overall, this movie could be better, but eventually Judy gave it all to her.
