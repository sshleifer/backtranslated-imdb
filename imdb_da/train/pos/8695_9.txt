A long time ago I saw this movie from the middle of the cable. I then had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eat Raoul. I was convinced that she is the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I might be biased about this movie. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I own on original tape.
