First of all, I liked the central idea of ​​locating '' welcoming '', others in the fragile Self, at different levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, the invaders are ubiquitous throughout the film: in the Swiss-French border, where the pretagonist leads a secluded life; in his recurring daydream and nightmare; Inside his sad body after heart transplant ... In the last half of the film, he becomes intrusive and returns to the old French colony hoping to reconcile the past. <br /> <br /> The overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilt, failure is more or less dominant. This is a pretty ugly picture of an old age, apparently self-reliant but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. The director composes the images more to convey passing feelings of anxiety and desire than any express meaning. Some of them are fascinating, not devoid of humor, but kind of absurdist play, only somnambulist can visualize.
