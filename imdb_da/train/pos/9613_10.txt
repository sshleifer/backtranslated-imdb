It's hard to describe Bug in words, it's one of the movies that really has to be seen to be understood. It follows a story that is more fluid and interesting than anything I've seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters respond to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to be followed, the audience is merely an observer. The almost proustic narrative stream of thought to the thought, the very spontaneity of the script will make you stick to the screen and wait with anxiety to see how it all works in the end. And with regard to the thematic elements ... there is a special sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful and then to tragic, all within an instant of about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It is reminiscent of why independent films may be the brightest star film industry at the moment. Perhaps with more films of Bugs quality, people will begin to notice it.
