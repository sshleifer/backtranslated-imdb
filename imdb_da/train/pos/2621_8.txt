Disney has done it again. Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and see it over and over again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and fellow human beings before going out to find his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they are looking for the home that Timon wants and repeatedly fails, which is fun as Timone is becoming increasingly crazy. Then Simba comes up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the two previous films. You already know the rest.
