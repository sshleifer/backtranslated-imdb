Colorful western. <br /> <br /> Wyoming cowboy James Stewart moseys up to the Yukon Territory to dig for gold, sell his rule and try to date with the beautiful salon owner Ruth Roman if he can shake the tail of crooked Sheriff John McIntire who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful filmography in a collaboration between William Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International, directed by Anthony Mann. <br /> <br /> Also with Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist and Walter Brennan as Stewart's sidekick.
