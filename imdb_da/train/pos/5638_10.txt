I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be appreciated more. This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up whatever people can do or say to counter and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in everyone's life when people judge them for what they are not who they are. Watching this movie will enable you to understand that you are special in your own way and that you must follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She will never know how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
