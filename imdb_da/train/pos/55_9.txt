At first I wasn't sure I would watch this movie when it came up to my guide, so I looked at IMDb and thought the deck looked pretty cold so I thought I'd give it a try to expect a movie like Elephant. When I passed the fact that I supposed not to like the Alicia character playing excellently by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this movie did to create the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so meaningful that Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but we finally find that, despite being polar opposites, they have one thing in common besides being present at the recording. They share loneliness and the extent to which the film's progress is revealed. <br /> <br /> I just got to say how much I loved this movie and was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I couldn't even get through Elephant because it just seemed to exploit the Columbine tragedy. This film, on the other hand, was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN ​​!!! It's a good thing, and I'd like to see her progress in some more mature roles.
