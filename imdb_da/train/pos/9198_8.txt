B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First movie? Yes. But aesthetic A +. This movie definitely had a bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. etc. issues. However, this film has many positive things about it. First, the most annoying character dies first! Second, it is made to be a parody / fun B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolled around on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to take each independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is, just what it is really good.
