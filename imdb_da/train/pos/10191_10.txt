What is contained on this disc is a first-class show with a first-rate band. This disc is NOT too weak in the heart ... the music is incredibly intense and very cool. What you want to learn when watching this movie is just why, who was so great for such a long time. It is true that their records were large, but their shows were the top of the pile. In 1969, when this concert was shot, the screaming teenie boobs who threw jelly beans on the Beatles were gone, and bands (and audiences) sat down to long and often amazing shows of musical virtuosity - something the audience has the intellectual curiosity pursuing the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here is the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
