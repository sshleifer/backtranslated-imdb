Yes, I will say before I start commenting. This movie is incredibly undervalued. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is amazing in her role as Catherine Trammell, like Morrissey as dr. Glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The action was good (except Thewlis). Stone really has a talent with this role. She is slim, naughty and seductive and does not look a day older than she did in the first. She really impressed me (as in the Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vaner ablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis, however, was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top all the way. He really sucked. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not that good the first, but Stone is a hoot to see. Just ignore Thewlis.
