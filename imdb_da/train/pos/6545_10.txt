I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews have been bad, but most critics believe that a movie should be like an idea drama. This movie has a little drama, but the rest is just fun and very entertaining. Forget that Julia Roberts is a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that. Emma was so funny to see in the role of Nancy Drew. It is good to see a new face. I think she will go a long way. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew must not be based on the books, but history is still good. There is also a good mix of other character actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited. I'm surprised Disney didn't release this movie. Some people do not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and curse. This is a good family movie, which is rare in this time. So take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can't wait for the successor.
