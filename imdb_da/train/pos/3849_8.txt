This last Dutch speaking film from Verhooven made me laugh well. As a movie film looking for all the little details and cross-references, etc. in any movie, I can assure anyone interested in cinema that this piece amuses all senses. I have not read the Gerard Reves book, which the film is based on, but I still believe that we get an honest picture of a self-conscious poet / writer who gets his (in a way - no destruction here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions as he has. All this in an excellent packed movie, Paul Verhopven manages to turn the otherwise pretty sweet "gesellich (?)" Dutch places into an exciting movie-noir setting, impressive work!
