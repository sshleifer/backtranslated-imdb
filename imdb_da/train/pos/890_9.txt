This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a fantastic piece of Hong Kong action cinema. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao seeking love and being mixed up with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all sympathetic and well-defined. The story is involved and has enough romance, drama, comedy and excitement to keep one looking between battle scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best match choreographer in the company. The plot is simply amazing, esp. the match w / Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are wonderful. One must look for any fan of action.
