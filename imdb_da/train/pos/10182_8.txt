good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. But the main point again as his film tends to be, the man is the best actor in idia and can make dust for gold. nana patches. This may be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> good movie, although I think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without. You can see in his movie, others try very hard to reach their heights and act out of their skins. But this man is really an elase. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool, the music and the direction are excellent plot a little thin, but the screen and dialogue again very good. a must see.
