I do not expect Gackt and Hyde to imagine as well as they were, nor did they expect to be thrown into such an artfully well-developed, enough-plot movie to keep you interested and plentiful to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I want to look for the next movie like that. I especially like it to be a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire girl, nor did it surrender. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you feel sorry for their entire lives. I give this movie two thumbs up so far. Absolutely the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
