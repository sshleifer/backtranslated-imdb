This is another story-that-it-is Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I am not sure why he has this obsession to show baby moles *** ion and g * y concepts to the Indian cinematic audience, but I find some of these scenes really disgusting! What is new? It's a nice piece composed of Bhandarkar, showing the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous movie, Mr And Mrs Iyer. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with, such as her roomies, her colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people, and others on the entertainment page # 3 in her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Remarkable: It's another good performance from Mrs Iyer. She will probably be noticed for this role. She does selective roles, but shines in them. She is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this movie. But then, the entertainment reporters don't have to cross the people they cover, right? Rating: Madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely. But this film loses focus and you are not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people? Or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrast it with the life of the REAL criminal reporter? Does he try to tell us how the government and the rich people control the press? or he tries to illustrate the problems of child abuse and folk music. The other concepts generated include the unwritten rule that young women should sleep with directors or co-stars if they want to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> He also talks about how aircraft assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and take into account extreme measures of marrying very elderly people, etc. He also speaks of unhappy women and spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> It was all okay for me .. but maybe be too complicated for an average movie-goer who just wants to relieve stress from the daily work
