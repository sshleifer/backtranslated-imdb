This is a great movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Although some of the actors and actors were not very popular in the show business, they seemed to have acted since they were 1 a year old! It was fun, brutal and just a very good movie. In most parts, I didn't know what would happen next time! I was like I think this will happen, wait, I think this is going to happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I couldn't stop laughing, it was so much fun, but in some parts I became widespread, and I couldn't believe what I saw! I will definitely watch this movie again! It's one of those movies where it can't be bored. Every time you see it, it's so exciting. I definitely recommend watching this movie !!
