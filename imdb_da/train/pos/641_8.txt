This show has a couple of clich√©s and a few over the top, Dawson's Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about way back when life was sensible?), But generally it seems like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move well in the pilot - ending up with a good lesson in the end. I just hope that every episode doesn't turn out to be life-changing as the first, it would just be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I think many of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he would always have a part of.
