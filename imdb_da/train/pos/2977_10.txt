There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can't really do it, can I? This movie is a movie to see if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I am serious. Do not look at this movie if you are easily offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and anything else related to nature. Being a woman and it can't even be a factor I can see this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts, I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I have to say. It is a little difficult for me to leave this comment because I am one of those people, such as Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurs off their mouths when they speak. So I keep it professional. Best movie. Heck yes !!
