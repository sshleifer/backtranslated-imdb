Mary Pickford ("Born on the 4th of July" as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (of French heritage); She falls in love with Jack Holt (as Karl Von Austreim), who had moved to America with his German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin from "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Mrs Pickford. The love-triangular triangle eventually arrives in France, with the great war (World War II in thought) complicating their lives considerably. <br /> <br /> A most entertaining, if propagandistically mistaken, Cecil B. DeMille movie. Tipping and synchronizing a ship with Pickford are "Titanic" -like. The war intrigues become dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for France, while the Germans occupy his ancestral home. Of course German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe they took so long to recognize each other when he moved in for rape, but it was dark; and past events had them believe in each other died. The movie goes WAY over-the-top in its symbolism. By the way, Pickford was Canadian - but few could deny that she was not a "Little American" for all purposes and purposes. <br /> <br /> FUN that spot "extras", which later became big stars, includes Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially be aware that Mr. Novarro exhibits "star" quality during one of the movie's more memorable sequences: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write a letter to him; Of course he has a future in pictures. Also in the future is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; He becomes a reliable child actor and grows up to become a Jack Webb partner at "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Mary Pickford, Jack Holt, Raymond Hatton
