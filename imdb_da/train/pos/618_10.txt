This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted," I should say and surprised because of how unambiguous it was. Casting, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it great from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining, healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me, it is the representation of modern adventure. It's like the modern peter pan ... simply amazing <br /> <br /> I would definitely buy a copy of this currently the hit market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double MUST SEE one ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
