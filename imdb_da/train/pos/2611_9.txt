This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, gritty, the characters are real, the situations are trustworthy and it's not shy away from the darker side of life faced every day with the police and the criminals, victims, lawyers, and other people in their various lanes. <Br /> <br /> This show ran for 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show did not sell well abroad. We're all sorry for the lost. But like Fawlty Towers, we can count this as a limited series of uniformly high quality.
