Gentleman Jim is not really a boxer. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. But that said, the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener for the modern viewer. There are no 12 round points decisions here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish banker who gets a shot at the gravity world title. Flynn is well-suited for the role of suave but unpredictable Corbett. His opponent, John Sullivan, is still better, but a wienerbror from the old school is played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie is a man who pushes his big chance. Corbett leaves his lively life and builds a new person like gentleman Jim. Jim is a chance to adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egoist. Sullivan, the weighty boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute, but his honesty and sportsmanship gives some contrast to the protagonist. There is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the necessary redemption for everyone. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
