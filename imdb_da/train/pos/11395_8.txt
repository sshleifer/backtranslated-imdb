I dug out of my garage some old musicals and it's another of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of funds and is very interested in helping him but quickly finds that she loves the guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls for a lovely girl, Leslie Caron. His biggest dance partner, and I have to say they are amazing together on the floor and otherwise. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant's clever piano finger, the songs from George Gershwyn will live up forever in this colorful gem. 8.10
