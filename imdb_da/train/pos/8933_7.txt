Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that movies do not have to tell a story that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. <br /> <br /> Probably the idea within the framework of a most non-linear movie is the older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs who still have a lover but whose heart status is increasingly threatening its life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meet with him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and To regain a long lost relationship with a son he had formed a Tahitian woman many years ago. What Denis does with this disposition of a story is to use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the greatness of nature, human interaction with humans vs. animals, etc. Much of the time, "movie" is not reasonable, but it is because we are trying too hard to connect all the dots laid out for us in beautiful pictures. Life is like this: we see, see, observe, integrate, treat, and do what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this kind of filmmaking (much as she did in the oddly beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer finds the finished product rewarding or not, it has a lot to do with our individual methods of treating visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers find it a far too long discourse on very little. Maybe we will see again, it will change. Grady Harp
