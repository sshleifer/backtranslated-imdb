Now you take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier turned all American bus drivers deciding to rescue their passengers alone, just incase no one else to go and Arte Johnson in a totally equal role as a tour guide who does not know what to do, but does not want admit that they are in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three baby-born boys who intend to kidnap an heirs and leave a box of people to die on the dessert and you have to act , plot twists and much drama. Everyone was good, but seeing Lama's as the bad boys shamelessly blew my mind. He was far too credible as the indulgent bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heir but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him. It was obviously long before he cultivated his good picture. And believe me a 20 year old Lorenzo in tight jeans, you really don't want to miss!
