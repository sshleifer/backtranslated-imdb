I could never remember the name of this show. I use to see it when I was 8. I remember getting up late when I wasn't supposed to just see this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember, it's still great. This showed star player Lucas Black, who made him the first boy I ever fell in love with. I am from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him I would surely make an exception. As after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift you should see why. He is a great actor and has been since he was a child. I miss this show and wish it would come back. If anyone ever sees where they are selling the season, please contact me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
