This is the first review I have written for IMDb so just with me, but I caught this flick on HBO and was sure I saw it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as the passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is amazing, and there's never a dull scene that slows down the movie's pace. Some parts of the movie dealing with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like the Se7, you can just limit the scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a good detective / excitement movie, ignore the low rating this movie got on IMDb and definitely see it.
