First I want to say how big this is. It's amazing and sometimes shocking. And for the most part I am 11 years old, and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring movie, but that's all but boring. It's like a walk through humanity. Its sharp realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT and Hoffman) who build a common friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich with entertaining women. Soon he will meet Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man who can hardly pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager', but soon both men cannot find Joe a job that results in stealing food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how hard it is. They can't get Joe a girl before they meet a lady at a party. Joe earns some money, and soon Joe Ratso takes on a Ratso Dream Place, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbeat, but some of the greatest moments in the movie. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a sharp and sometimes disturbing city view over life.
