No premium show can please all people. Obviously, if your favorite movies didn't win, you'd say the show wasn't very good. It is understandable. <br /> <br /> But the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first-ever appearance at the Academy Awards. <Br /> <br /> Allen has often cut prices as self-destructive and meaningless, and has never participated - even though he has won several of the coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Awards were held, the nation still grieved for the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it was time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the big movie moments that formed the city cities. Then the announcer simply said: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar's award-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place erupted in an extremely prolonged ovation. The entertainment industry must finally give their applause to the man from New York, who usually escapes the Hollywood scene. When the applause died down, Woody used some of his legendary angles to the situation. <br /> <br /> Some highlights: <br /> <br /> "Thank you - it does for the strip search." <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back," he shot . "I panicked because the farmer's shop has been out of service for years, and I had no way of getting anything." <br /> <br /> "But it wasn't. I couldn't do it because my movie wasn't nominated for this year. Then it hit me - maybe they called for apology." Allen also described why he had overlooked his lifelong Oscar aversion for this one special night. <br /> <br /> "For New York City I wanted to do something. So I got my tux on and came down here," Allen said. "It's a great, big movie city. It's been a great, moving and exciting movie scene, and it's still a big, big city." <br /> <br />
