I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew for reviving the once-moribund visanian film underneath. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this people (claiming more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details accurately resemble this region of the Philippines. The disadvantage: The American antagonist's corny and styled action. The second issue, which I did not appreciate, was the lack of authenticity in the "period" costume of the same nature, and above all his bright red kit car, which I suppose to pass to a 1930s roadster. Without the small but sharp details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least 9 out of 10 on my rating - day hang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film surely strikes Peque Gallagas "Oro, Plata, Mata", which gave another view of the Visayas during World War II. Alos, there are some parts where the cinematography goes back to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the story begins to resemble "Noli Me Tangere".
