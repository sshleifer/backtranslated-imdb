There are many people in our lives that we only meet once in our lives, but for some reason we remember these people for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime create friendships between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons why we no longer meet these people. We do not always know their names, since we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's fun how ordinary humanity makes occasional friends, and we like to keep it as such because reunion can ruin good memories, or we don't know, they do. We're too scared to check it out. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' has just made me see it. I never intended to see it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I looked at the rest of the movie. I didn't know what to expect from it, but neither did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and everything could happen before they had to separate. I think this movie has had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has lived through at least once or twice. It makes us all think of all the people we have only met once in our lives.
