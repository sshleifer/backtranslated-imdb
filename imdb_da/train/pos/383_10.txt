This movie caught my heart from the beginning when you heard Quincy Jones first notes or see the wonderful color of purple flowers of the meadow. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a movie I've seen this year, and Spielberg has really surpassed it! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh gentleman!), Danny Glover, and the others, give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the insecurity and inferiority needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong with her throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" also have "souls". The always-sympathetic, charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job of getting people to hate him and the magnificent music of (say, Lord) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this amazing movie! The photograph, the music, the director and the music make this beautiful, soulful movie an experience of life. You won't miss it! "Last" ... remember my name ... "
