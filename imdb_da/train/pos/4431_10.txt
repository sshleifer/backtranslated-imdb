This movie is one of my most popular top 10 movies of all time. Many people see it for the first time and know a little about many of the themes in the film. It probably doesn't understand why I find it so exciting, so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in historical details and cultural insights, and while it has a few less anachronism, they are completely forgivable. The story is a tale of the famous duel between Monk Benkei and the young prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo Bridge. During the fight according to legend, Yoshitsune disputes Benkei and the monk becomes the loyal lover of the prince. However, this film is a revision of that story and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the movie is "Mappo", which is the Buddha's prophecy, which after 1000 years would fail his teaching, and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan after the outbreak of Mt Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would break. It's a time for demons. <br /> <br /> Next, you have the way the movie solves the issue of Yoshitsun's sword training of Tenku (Raven Goblins) by Karuma. Defeated clans often fled into the mountains and pampered themselves as demons to scare the locals. This is said to be where ninja clans began historically. Yoshitsune's portrayal in Gojo fits well with all this. <br /> <br /> Then there are Benkei and the various Buddhist patterns depicted, including a lot of esoteric Buddhism from the Shingon sect. These are all depicted quite precisely, and only to add a little extra is the film directed to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it integrated into history, ie. It uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to movies, but does so in a way that makes it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is filled with fascinating gorges and rings surprisingly true to life for the period. The scenery and costuming are also quite unmissable and very authentic. The sound track is large, very brooding and malicious. I also thought that the actual performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man testing his borders and growing increasingly full of his own power, and Tetsukichi, the howling swordsmith makes for and interesting depiction of the "common man "and his less than flattering sense of the murderers who want their social efforts. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, to see why it is so good, I really suggest you dig an old book on Japanese history and see how this story becomes an almost capricious Robin Hood vs Little John story in a gory tale of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.
