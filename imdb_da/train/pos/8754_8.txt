I watched this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best female friend. I got my judge pulled out, so I didn't feel so good. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a great time. It is a hard watch if you take into account that it is about friendship, unwanted treason, power, money, drug trafficking and the extreme difficult situation of living in a foreign prison. at the primary level. Two of the women that I like most star and that is a good thing. Claire Danes is as sweet and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is extremely warm and delivers a good performance. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. Plus it shows the difficult times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underestimated movie. Not many movies like this one have come up in recent history. It should make you reflect on many things ...
