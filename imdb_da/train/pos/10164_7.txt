This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I went in to see a chick flick and some how ended up with this. I had never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's amazing! Eva, Lake and Paul provide amazing performances. Humor is consistently dry and witty. Paul Rudd plays very much mike character from friends (who works well). The other characters are stereotypes, and the plot is formal (I mean we don't speak 'Apocalypse Now' here) But the characters are sympathetic, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, the production and the direction all work well. <br /> <br /> In all, a good feeling-good movie that really deserves much more credit than it gets. Everyone has their own taste, but I really don't understand a star rating for this.
