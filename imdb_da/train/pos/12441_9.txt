It was the modesty that we didn't know! It was suggested and summed up in the comic book for the syndicates to sell to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who got The Dream Job - tell a prequel story of Modesty that the fans never saw before. In their commentary, they admitted that they made changes to her origins to make the story run smoother. The "Purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was "standing by time". I did not rent or borrow the DVD as other "reviewers" I bought it! And I don't want a refund! I saw it three times and I didn't sleep through it! Great dialogue and generous characters that I cared about (even bad guy Miklos) like in novels and comics! Also I can't wait for the next Modesty (and Willie) movie, especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
