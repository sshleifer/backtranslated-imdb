A super comedy series from the 1990s (Two series were made in total), which was part of the UK classification due to poor planning. When you face established comedies like 'Memories', even the best new comedies will struggle to be noticed. Fortunately, I caught the series from episode 1 and eagerly followed it. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have seen something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> In any case, I loved both series and never forgot. <br /> <br /> Then I looked it up on the internet and found out that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released alone. <br /> <br /> Now both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
