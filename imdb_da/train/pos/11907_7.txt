Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audience is not really interested in what puts protagonists at risk - only that they are in danger and need to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that Hitchcock was not 100% accurate. The police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime when she is clearly not. Trevor Howard decides that their best act is to run for it. And then the film's body has our charismatic couple dodging to and from trains, buses and coaches - jumping over the rocks at the top of a waterfall - scrambling over the dockyard roof. <br /> <br /> All good exciting things - but I couldn't figure out that it was all unnecessary. They should have stayed. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
