I just watched 2 movies by Pang brothers, The Eye and One only. When I saw the eye, I was disappointed with these two guys, whom I had previously heard good words about. The movie (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially the end (childish, clich√© and too coincidental in my opinion), but it is still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to see One take only, and I did not disappoint again. Still great photography, great picture, MTV style editing, cool music and this time history has a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful, you will see some small plot holes, but it does not cause any problems with the storyline. The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
