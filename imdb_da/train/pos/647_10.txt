Yes, of course not, women are too sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore but not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or blatantly lived on. Unlike many of you, I've only seen La Maman et La Putain twice. So many good movies, I noticed my opinion about it improved after another view. All I know is what I have seen and I have not yet deep in further exploits until I have acquired the DVD myself. I haven't yet figured out why I enjoy this movie so much, but really, I don't care why? Although I am sure I could and will create a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you can disagree, maybe it's a little boring at times, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely Grushenka.
