Some people have stated that South Park from the 11th season has started a tendency to leave their political bite satire for low spoofs; but this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode spoof the Living Dead series, there's more. It's a satire about how people treat the homeless. Signs say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They will be human." This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class, who are often just down their luck. So yes, it's still a satire, and also a wonderful spoof. What more could you have?
