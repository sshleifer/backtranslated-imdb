This is a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat taken away to live with someone for a while, but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog that senses things. Put the three together on an adventure, and it gives a happy and fun filled time. There are no special effects of the mouth moving, so it is not at all cheesy. It's the best talking animal movie I've seen so far. It is a great movie for families.
