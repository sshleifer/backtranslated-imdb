You have to go dig these holes. Holes only leave the troble, which makes a movie so good. Disney has done so again.Sia LaBeouf should be nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Stanley Yelnats. He has alredy won Daytime Emmy for best actor in a comedy series (Even Stevens). Holes is one of the best films in 2003.
