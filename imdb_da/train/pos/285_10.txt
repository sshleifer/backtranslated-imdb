I just want to say that no matter how low the budget movie is, it must be shown throughout this world the point of these movies. We don't read that much anymore, instead of people watching movies. Have this series out on DVD, made me read the whole series and want more. PLEASE DO ALL 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the signs, it destroys the effect. Because I am an adult to love the actors who have played the characters. PLEASE DO ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message and see the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. We can't get enough more. AWESOME JOB !!!
