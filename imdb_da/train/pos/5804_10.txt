Michael Jackson is not very popular in the United States, but in Europe (especially Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it is full of clichés, Michael praises him all the time. <br /> <br /> But you can't expect a plot or non-cliché in this kind of movie! It has entertaining visual effects, and the music is perfect. The Smooth Criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full of Moonwalks, group submissions and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with a uniform (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance act fans. But as I am an MJ fan, I have to warn all Michael Jackson haters out there: DO NOT watch this movie, you will only increase your hate ...
