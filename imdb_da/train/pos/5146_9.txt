As one who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war), I come from a unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of World War II on the other. These miniseries cannot dive into every part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general taste of the situation at that time and as well as Hitler's state of mind. In this, the series looks pretty good. Carlyle is very good as O'Toole, but I would like to have had more information about the relationships with others in celebration because Hitler did nothing alone. He had people around him who followed him to the letter often without question and certainly no doubt later in his murderous career. What went through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people investigate the subject more. It can also make people understand why anyone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue with power.
