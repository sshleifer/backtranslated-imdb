The primary aspect of this movie that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people have seen this movie and just don't get it and I don't understand why. As I watched this movie, I was taken on a private journey, which floored me. I will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be aware I am talking about things happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Pay attention! **** <br /> <br /> His is a "big move" life versus "small move". He chooses Natalia to be his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt first described King and Queen and their movements as she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen carefully to that description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks him a question, he flashes back to the past as if reviewing previous movements. (Flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) The feedback is also quite interesting because they not only give their point of view as a child, but also the other character. It is amazing. <br /> <br /> Different characters become either his helpers or his enemies, peasants, bishops, and knights, their actions informing you of who they are on. Even their location in a scene is crucial to understanding what's going on. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I don't want to comment more on what happens to Luhzin's character, but I hope this will highlight what actually happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels, so I support it. It was a treat and a joy to see. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I'd recommend a movie called Frisk. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters are treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
