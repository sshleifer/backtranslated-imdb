I liked Timothy Dalton, though he was a little young and too handsome to Mr. R. But I thought Zelah Clarke was too plump and short. However, this version was very true to the novel and very well filmed. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R, although George C Scott did really well, and it's a giant between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, though they were both too old for the role. I recently watched a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would love to see the two doing Jane Eyre. When I came to see the Ciarin Hinds version, I think I was Jane Eyred, but I will never tire of the first few minutes hearing Joan Fontaine's voice tell the opening of The First Version I Have Ever Seen. I will always go back and read the book again.
