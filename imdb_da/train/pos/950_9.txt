The setting and the actors make this TV movie the best representation of Dickens' classic tale. George C. Scott is very trustworthy as the rest of the casting. His Scrooge oozes with nastiness until the end of the movie. Then his character changes to someone who is really the opposite. The 19th century English town chosen for the setting creates a mood that fits Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this movie. It's a movie I see every Christmas with the real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
