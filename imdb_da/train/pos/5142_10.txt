It's easy to make general comments on a movie like this. The fact that it is one of the only remaining Japanese films from this era makes people say it "started Japanese cinema" and was "unlike anything the West has ever done". The latter of these two remarks is particularly false since Kinugasa himself admitted to tearing off "Caligari" on more than one occasion. But style was supposed to be imitated and does not disregard the meaning of this film. What we have here is experimental themes and composition based on already established visual styles that open the doors to a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities. For this purpose, madhouse is the ideal setting and the authors knew this. This is a milestone film and it has to be done to track it. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 - Essential
