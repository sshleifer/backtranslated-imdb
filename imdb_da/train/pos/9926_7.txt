Kiera Nightly moved from P&P to this action movie ... she could hardly have chosen to reinvent her image more dramatically. A great success in love indeed and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, she is once again "taking a trip". Like her bikini-dressed warrior woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscles, it's hard to imagine that this delicate frame stands for a bounty hunter's life ... but that's exactly what Domino Harvey (the right one) did, and I (as one of Nights biggest fans) think she wears if it's not. <br /> <br /> Stuff .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the postal code of the Beverly Hills in LA, where all movie stars live. * Domino Harvey's father's most famous movie was the Manchurian Candidate (as featured in the film). * Domino Harvey died of an overdose of the drug in his bath before the film came out in June 2005, after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just finished the negotiations on some of her music that was to be included in the film. * Kiera Knightly refers to Domino Harvey's sexuality in his interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie a little removed, check out Domino Harvey as the facts are more amazing than fiction.
