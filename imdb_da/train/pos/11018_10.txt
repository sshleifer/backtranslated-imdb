This movie is really nerve-racking Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was good as always! Michael Rooker made a surprising performance and John Lithgow plays an outstanding villain! The music is great, especially the theme! The movie is action-packed and never boring! If you are a Stallone fan then see Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
