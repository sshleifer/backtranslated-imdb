Before I watched this movie I had heard a lot about it and some scenes in the movie, but listening didn't make it for me, so I planned to see it and wow! Down Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of people who are hell bent on canoing down the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events that occur over them all. The drawing development takes some time to enclose the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but ultimately they know these guys as if they were your friend. The action, the dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you can get to Hollywood performance. Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy coming out very hard, but under the male veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character most in The focus, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him on every corner, really casts and throws him into another man at the end (his character transition was excellent). Down Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem like the stupid lunkheads that can just joke around and don't seem to be terribly serious unless they have it and they did. I was really amazed by Director Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel, very impressed. You can't go all your life without watching this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
