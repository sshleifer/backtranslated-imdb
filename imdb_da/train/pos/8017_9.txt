Stars: Julianna Donald, Lonny Price and Louis Zorich. cameos: Art Carney, Brooke Sheilds, Liza Minelli, James Coco, Joan Rivers, Dabney Coleman, Linda Lavin, Gregory Hines and others. <br /> <br /> Muppeteers: Jim Henson like Kermit, Rowlf, Dr.Teeth, Swedish Chef, Waldorf, Ernie and others. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt like Scooter, Janice, Statler and Beaker. Frank Oz like Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Animal, Bert, Cookie Monster and Sam Eagle. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Camilla Chicken, Floyd Pepper, Lew Zealand, Crazy Harry and Pops. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz like Gonzo, Zoot, Beuregard and Bunsen Hunnydew. <br /> <br /> Steve Whittemire like Rizzo the rat and others. <br /> <br /> Another great Muppet flick. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla are out of college and starring in a musical that they are trying to get on Broadway. After failing to get it produced, they all split and went their separate ways. I love the characters and cameos. The songs in the movie are "Together Again", "Look At Me, Here I", "Saying Goodbye", "And I Will Always Love You", "Rat Jazz" and "He Will Make Me Happy". Frank Oz leads this movie very well, and all the actors do a good job as Muppets are genuine. See it! 91 minutes. Rating G. My rating: A.
