I watched this movie after seeing Practical Magic, and the older movie was much better. I liked the way the lighting, makeup and costumes changed when Gillian changed her story. Jimmy Stewart's manuscripts didn't do much for me in this movie, but I suppose they served to highlight the reserve of Gillian's character. I was also hit by Nickys and Gillian's mannerisms - it was as if the director wanted him to look, and Gillian would appear masculine. The gestures Nicky does when he shows Redlich, his forces especially hit me. I have never thought of warlocks as being effined, so it was an interesting way to contrast these signs.
