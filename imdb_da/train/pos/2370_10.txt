It's a great American martial arts movie. The fighting sequences were pretty impressive for American films made in the 90s. Of course, the fighting sequences are not as good as in Honk Kong movies. In fact, there are few American film games that are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even today. When you look at American martial arts movies, you expect to see less impressive combat situations, but still have some good moves, which can be surprisingly good sometimes, or at least that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed with this movie. Some combat situations were really impressive, the play, the direction and the plot were good enough, so it is really worth watching movies if you like American martial arts films from the 90s.
