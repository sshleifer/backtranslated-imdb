Soylent Green I found out to be an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you like this. <br /> <br /> Yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the play may be described as "cheesy", but the story is excellent. The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very exciting. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded at a glance at the right pace. <br /> <br /> The closest contemporary equivalent would be "Dark Angel" as to how the United States is shown to be the third country.
