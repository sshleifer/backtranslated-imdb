In 1985 (Steven Spielberg), Steven Spielberg led an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie (Debut role to Whoopi Goldberg) whose lives are followed through at times. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth to two children to her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widow puts eyes on Nettie, but their father gives Celie to him. It is the beginning of an era of terrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and especially an African American woman, their rights are less than a zero. Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and undervalued film by Spielberg. He should do more drama, such as "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good ideas. <br /> <br /> Cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a raving fun comedienne, but the introducing role of Celie is a remarkable word that she can really draw from heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "Mister". I have never seen him in such a vicious role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong will of Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when you watch this movie. You can really connect the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have such close relationship with your siblings that I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Big welcomes Mr. Spielberg!
