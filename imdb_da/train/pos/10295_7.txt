Okay, so it's not a masterpiece like the godfather, but it doesn't have to be. The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times. If it can make the viewer laugh a lot of times, it has achieved its purpose. I laughed aloud and went with a smile. I want to get my money's worth.
