Rohmer rejects his usual portraits of French middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What's more appealing about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the amazing aesthetics Rohmer has achieved. The pictures are digitally decorated and make them look like baroque images. For a few moments you can't really say if you see a movie or a series of pictures in the Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * min rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
