I bought this game on an impulse purchase from walmart. I'm glad I did. Listening to Sean Connery and playing the game was very entertaining. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. The bonus level was very difficult! The sniper I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated that I didn't play the game for half an hour and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to cope with it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I did not notice any difference from upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade did not seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my meter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.
