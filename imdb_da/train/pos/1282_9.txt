Saw this a few times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice movie jumble for the system. A semi-surreal but hard-edged on the modern media culture (or the lack of it) that focuses on some seriously wacked, far beyond the Hollywood fringe dwellers. It had an entertaining early performance by Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable films by DP, which made the Polish brothers film. There was a tough umcompromising humor and a strange original feel to it that certainly puts it apart. This movie had cult classics written over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
