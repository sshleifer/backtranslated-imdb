Saw this movie in August at the 27th National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's the first public screening. THE MOVIE IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the movie, and Denzel's direction is right on the money. See the open weekend. You will not be disappointed.
