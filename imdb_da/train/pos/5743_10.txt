I loved this movie! It was all I could do to break down tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. I was hit by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the talent of Tom Hulce, depicting Ray's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and horrible childhood event. But Tom's character, although heartbreaking, does not know self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, don't miss it !!
