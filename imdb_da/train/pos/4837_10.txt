I was a young film student in 1979 when the Soviet film authority came to Sofia Bulgaria and rewarded Konchalovsky's "Siberia"; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. So and only then did I see "Siberia" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. The road better than Bertolucci's "1900". Long! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow come to the negative and make "Director's Restored Version Full Length" one day! On DVD of course! Also, I fought hard for the defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who looked like Soviet movies with bad taste! Time is on my side.
