CB4 was terrible, but it could have given Cundieff the idea for the better. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is clever from the start. Surprisingly anyone who saw it back in the mid-nineties. The performance is played by laughs, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and slightly different. They respond to situations like some of us might. Now we don't have to throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late for the concert, or drag weapons and knock down a record company exec, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (med) H (hats) takes himself seriously enough to rewind, so you are connected. rent or get it at all costs, even if you are not really into rap music, it will still let you gas high. Comparing this with CB4 is like comparing George Lucas 'Star Wars to Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
