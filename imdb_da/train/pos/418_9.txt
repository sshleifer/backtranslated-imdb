This is a rip roaring western, and I have seen it many times and it is entertaining at all levels. But if your true facts about such legends as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane look elsewhere as John Ford suggested, it's west as the truth becomes the legend print legend. The story moves at a blast pace, and there is a good dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very attentive stars who help to make this movie. The sharp eye among you can just see Gabby Hayes as an Indian scout, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn who makes his debut as Cayenne warrior, he actually married one of Demilles daughters in real life. Without his Quinns character informing Cooper of the massacre Custer told in flash back, the final is well done, and when the credits roll it, the American West secures American history. So take the time to see this classic western.
