One of the first OVA's ("original video animation") I've ever bought, it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk-sci-fi action comedy against an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) the background of near future pollution in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The Dominion's "heroes" are the Tank Police formation with a "if we can't beat crimes, we get bigger weapons" philosophy and, as the name suggests, patrol the city in tanks rather than patrol cars. and that is actually far more dangerous than any criminal trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these police are cross-border (?) Psychopaths and neurotics that make new meaning to the term "loose guns". Like colorful and entertaining, their opponents, terrorist Buaku and his hands (we) men, Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always involves involving thought police hard time. <br /> <br /> The animation is not modern but it is very nice otherwise; The colorful palette and cartoon-like appearance of the characters and mecha fit well with the comedian atmosphere of Dominion. The English dubbing is again very fun. The soundtrack in the English version is also very good. I wonder if they have ever made a sound album of it ... <br/> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It's Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy, full of over-the-top characters and situations, so make sure it never takes you seriously. Highly recommended.
