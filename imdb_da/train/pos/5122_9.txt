# 3 in young John Travolta's trilogy of blockbusters. He dances to the disco, rock and roll and country. He leads to Houston to find work and love. Gilley is hot spot, and that is the time of the mechanical bull. Not to be outdated, I rode the bull to a club in Nashville. I recently watched this almost forgotten movie on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat that year like Travolta. Debra Winger was in her prime. She looks great in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem the ideal pair even though they are the trailer garbage can. They just split because it feels so good to get together again. Urban Cowboy has a fantastic soundtrack. We're going to hear Lyin 'Eyes by The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
