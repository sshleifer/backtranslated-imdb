Yes, it's cheesy, it's not zombie, but it's not that bad either. It has Beatrice Ring, which is a huge bonus and it is entertaining. I was fortunate to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience as he was never quite happy with it. It is worth seeking out, especially for genre and Fulci fans. It is a movie that is all too often dismissed outside of hand.
