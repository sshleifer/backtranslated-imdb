I loved this show from the first aeration and I was always looking to see every episode every week. The reason, the signs, the writing, the special influences were excellent! Then the sci-fi channel screwed again and canceled a very entertaining, well-written show. I say bring it back, I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVDs I am. I hope the sci-fi channels get the word from these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only see a show on that channel now (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll soon cancel it too.
