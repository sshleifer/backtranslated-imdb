This movie gets it right. As a former USAF Aviation Cadet, I can tell you that this movie has it all. The application process. Waiting for words. The joy of acceptance. It worries about doing it through the course. The grief of seeing his friends (maybe the best of them) washes out. The fear of paying the ultimate price - the death of the students flying. Honesty of the exam. Always the flying, the flying, the flying. Many are called, but few are selected. We did to pay what we would have paid to do.
