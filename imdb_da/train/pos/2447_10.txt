George Lopez never got my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't. But this show is a work of art. It never shows where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember it (and jokes that are memorable on it). This show just has an optimal look at it, and the characters range from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I don't know who is writing this show, but the person does a good job. If they had just continued the show, I'm sure it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you're looking for a good, traditional comedy then the George Lopez show is for you! The one bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the fresh prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". C'mon man! But otherwise this show is genius! 10.10
