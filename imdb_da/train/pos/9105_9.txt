Women have never looked as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras. Although the editor's cut here and there can help the film, it is exciting and fun with an intense brand from Pedro Almodovar's latest movie. 5 different women handle their male partners and families. Starting with several different stories bound to meet as the plot continues, Salazar portrays his women in the same neurotic and cross-border behavior known to Almodovar. A kleptomanic high society lady with a greasy for smaller shoes, a burlesque house, fears taking care of her disabled daughter, a drug addict dancer occupied with her former boyfriend and a taxi driver who takes care of her late husband's disturbed children, all of whom are streaming streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodovar's well-known actresses, in his first film, the director succeeds in providing depth for all the characters sharing the movie and for creating true sympathy with each one. The women control the plot and the men are bound to be left with each other, finally ... Surprisingly good for a first movie, and worth the time in any standard. It is noteworthy that Salazar hesitated with some necessary guidelines for the actresses, but an impressive act is still shown on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who played in her earlier short film. <br /> <br /> A must for all Almodovars fans, and comfortable for everyone.
