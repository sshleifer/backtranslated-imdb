This movie kept me constantly entertained. In comparison to this for serial mother, Mr. Waters have gone back to his gritty side. This is almost not so polished. <br /> <br /> There's a dark side here. A message about how success and fame changes a person - but more importantly how it changes the people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no fake moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are some cartoon-like ... but I want to believe this is what Mr. Waters are trying to achieve. It is fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... This is really his finest work.
