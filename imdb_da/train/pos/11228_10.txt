This is short and to the point. The story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Action is all over the card, but the protagonists over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will come to the end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I don't want to rehash what has already been said about sets and graphics . Considering this, everything is voluntary, for no profit, it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If this was ranked as a professional production, I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible set. But as a fan-based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts, this is in a separate league. For pure volume, I don't think this has been matched. Congratulations to the castrator and the crew for an effort that many admire.
