Glacier Fox is one of the most heartfelt and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie interests you in every member of this fox, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes fun and also tragic. Faced with an inhospitable landscape, the hearts of the public are warm to the family members. <br /> <br /> The score and lyrics of the music tell the story intercut with the story of what happens in general. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we are undoubtedly the foxes capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavor.
