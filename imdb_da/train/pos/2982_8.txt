I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the comics of our time. They have the eerie ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and do it reasonably, but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This is essentially what makes South Park so much fun. When you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever, you see in every episode the message being conveyed. It is clear in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker and completely rediculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is important league sports. I am also a fan of sports, so I find this movie fun at times because it is so true in the bizarre way people hate to love. The opening profile is brilliant ... tears from laughter form every time I see these football players begin Riverdance! Some don't like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea ... but like South Park when you look past the absurdity ... it has a really genuine message conveyed through a literally comic genius. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
