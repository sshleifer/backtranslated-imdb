I had long been waiting for this movie ever since I saw the trailer, making it a political drama starring at three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, he and Pacino combined the SEA OF LOVE, which is among each of their best work. But interference at some level (for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer are not shown in the movie) and the change of tone (subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) does this while it can be seen, not as close as it could have been. <br /> <br /> It's too bad because I really want to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption and making a complex statement on that corruption, not the usual good guys vs. evil. And there are good plays here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello is one of the best performers in his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role without having to do anything, and while there is merit in the central story when it comes to a thriller, the movie loses its way, resumes briefly in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino and then falls completely down the end. I wish I liked more here, but no.
