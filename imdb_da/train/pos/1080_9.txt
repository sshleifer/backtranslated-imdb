Movie "comedies" today are generally 100 minutes with toilet humor, creepy language and groin-sparking. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the unpleasant and slow of the brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy comes together, but they are getting rarer all the time. "Mr. Blandings Buildings his Dream House" shows what 1940 Hollywood could do, and it's just screaming fun. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, starting with house hunting, the house's rebellious construction, all the way to the finished home - with its "zuzz-zuzz softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly fun as he looks at house costs zoom out of control). However, the movie is stolen by Blandings' show attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Need to steal every scene he is in, Douglas is understated as he looks at Blanding's lurch from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as Blanding's harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water drill are also amazing. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times, and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to see when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.
