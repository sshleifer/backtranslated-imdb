The film only enters the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after the official release, and after many illegal DVDs had found its way to the public. Apparently, the popularity of the illegal DVDs for publishing to the theaters, with still publicity, is going to see. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great epic that brings Japanese culture into your house in an exciting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story of a theater writer writing a story to his theater is told as the regular Kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring. <br /> <br /> Initially, the audience may be a little confused about what story we follow, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male man and a female demon leads to a great story for a new one kabuki play. <br /> <br /> The audience is back in the dark if it's a story that really has to happen in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that doesn't matter. How the story is told with a love of theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy makes this a good trip on the hunt for Japanese cinema as well as theater. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, try to watch it in a movie theater rather than on your television at home. <br /> <br /> A critical point though: the audio track is sometimes a little annoying. Although mostly good music, there is a moment in the movie, which I think they should have chosen more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that history contains humorous moments is that the instructor also chooses lighter moments in music.
