Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple. The movie is full of scary visuals and scary "that get the most spicy horror veteran jumping right out of there. Staircase stage especially, these guys are good. Dark Remains has one of these interpretative conclusions, which can be a negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are spot on when the sad couple are trying to rebuild there, but some side signs that the sheriff did not convince me. They are not so important anyway. I give Dark Remains a perfect ten rating to be ten times frightening than any newer studio ghost story / Japanese remake.
