Salva and his buddy Bigardo have been in the law's margin in most of their lives. We see them panoperating in a car of the underground, where their pitch for getting donations is so boring, no one gives them anything! Salva, a hardened petty criminal, does not even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and the show industry turn out to be a winning combination, something Salva exploits. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo have been in prison for a president who was inappropriate death critical of the duo. Salva shows that he is a natural for the reality show. He turns into a Christlike figure, an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is the producer of the producer, cannot escape from the way Salva pays his unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end. Jordi Molla, whose first direct job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirises the TV role. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which the leader felt is an attack on the audience and wanted to put his story on the views of the people who make happiness out of the naive audience . <br /> <br /> The ensemble cast has some great moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, as any actor who decides to correct his first function, would have been more effective in concentrating on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
