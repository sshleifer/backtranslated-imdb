Waiting Womans Ward by a large built-in hospital with all its joys and sorrows is the place where Life begins. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera, full of comedy and tragedy, all tied to maternity staff and their patients. The sincerity on which the subject is handled highlights the movie's pre-code status. <br /> <br /> Marvelous Aline MacMahon, as the sympathetic head nurse, is the quiet center of the movie, the cliff around which all of them flow. Treat any crisis or emergency, she is the best of the mothers, sometimes the last friend. Around MacMahon is a wealth of excellent costars: Loretta Young as a doomed killer released from prison long enough to feed; Eric Linden as her scared young man; brassy Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as Thoughtful, Compassionate Doctors and Frank McHugh as a Comic Frightening Father to Be. <br/> <br /> Movie belly recognizes Bob's Watson as a mighty thief who wants to see Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous man who promises to behave like a "little soldier; 'Gilbert Roland as a confused Italian man and Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty wife who is interested in adopting Farrell's son - all unredited. There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are of course much too old; Farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the ward, but none of the staff seems to notice it; An obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but it only enhances the cinematic entertainment value of the movie and keeps things from being too serious.
