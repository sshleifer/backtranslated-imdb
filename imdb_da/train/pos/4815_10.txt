This is on my top list of all-time favorite movies! It's a fantastic and insightful movie. It was historically interesting and good to see! I thought the Emily Blunt actor was great, and Rupert Friend was a great Albert, the best actor chosen for Albert. The costumes were beautiful and the settings and scenes like the opera house were amazing and detailed. I just loved it, all that! I loved the childhood scenes where she was "bullied" by John Conroy. And where her mother says she's going to go upstairs with an adult. Once, the authors have done it! They produced this amazing script! <br /> <br /> It deserves the prices they have got.
