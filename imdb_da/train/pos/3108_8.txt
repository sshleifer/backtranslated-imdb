This submission makes the CIA much like a very foolish organization. In fact, they may be. After all, it looks like a man has the power to sanction to kill everyone with his own people to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne tries to be a step ahead of being killed throughout the movie. He still tries to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from a few people and it looks like every minute of the movie someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to rest in this movie and the action sequences seem very real. There are many chase sequences recorded with the shaking cam that somehow adds to the realism and makes it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the movie in feeling. The excitement of some of the sequences is made excellent while wondering if anyone should die or if Bourne can lead them away. This is the kind of action you are going to see when you want to be entertained, and I'm sure this will lead to the next movie in the series.
