Barred some of the dubious acts (musicians at the end of the day), it's Quentin Tarrinno's words, "The Best Rock Movie Ever Made ... Period". Think 8 Mile, but without the rapping - a young musical that tries to prove itself to the community while struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band. Throw in the sex interest and the amazing achievements, this is the real 8 kilometers. Prince gives a solid performance as Morris Day and Jerome Benton also do. Decent script, good direction, great plot and spectacular performances. Not to mention some of the best rock / pop / funk music you will ever hear.
