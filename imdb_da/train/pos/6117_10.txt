All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you yourself are distant "PC" or don't have a serious terrifying sense of humor then you probably won't. As ill and disgusting as this movie is, it really is a comedy and not a "horror" movie at all. If you can appreciate someone pushing the boundaries of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where it becomes so out of hand that it is comical then you should see this for Believe it. This film is so uncontrolled that a large film studio could not touch this with a 10 foot coil (with a condom on the end). In my opinion, the best, most extreme works of art come from the subway. If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I've seen stacks of horrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies just a waste of a good VHS tape or DVD-R. I've also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a total waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie like these two by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and blows all the other "shock" movies all the way out of the water, you really have to look at another look at the whole Indy scene. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy movie producer can have when working alone. <br /> <br /> The fun is even the others who saw this movie and "hated it" admit they laughed all the way through it. I don't think it's possible for anyone to get bored with seeing either of these two. So if you do not take everything you see in the ordinary media too seriously and can laugh at a misanthropic puppet-handling psychopath who has finally struck, then you should see it. You just have to see it for stand alone, cult classic, that it is. Both schizophrenia / schizophrenia 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 DVDs.
