"I've looked at the island on the island, and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the protagonists of ABC's award-winning TV show "Lost". The series can be summed up as a drama story of a group of plane crashes stranded on an unknown island, but it would render the show a bad service. "Lost" follows a large group of characters that conflict with the island, each other and ultimately even as they struggle with their new lifestyle and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear, nor is it an ordinary island - and they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My first fear of hearing the concept in this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period, but it turned out to be unfounded. The story flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the performance is amazing. The island is a character alone and to understand this comment one must see the series for itself, which only shows its originality and grandeur. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have aired and they are filled with strong episodes. My only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down halfway, but fortunately it comes back in admirable form to the last episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a TV series, follow now it would surely be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful places and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
