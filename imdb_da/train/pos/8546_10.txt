This is one of the funniest and most outstanding movies ever made! Even though I've only seen forty minuets of it and I have to say it's a good movie. The reason is fun and because there is sex around just about every corner of this movie. It's really fun, and I can't see how anyone didn't like this movie. I really really really want to see the rest of the movie. It has a slightly sick scene in it (believe me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that it's a great movie. I rate this movie a 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. If you are a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there is virtually all sex in it, buy this movie. You will. <br /> <br /> 10/10
