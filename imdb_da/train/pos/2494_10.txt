The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and had a drama element where Bill (the mother) fought for all the common problems in life, but that element was a little depressing and did not blend well with the comedy elements That is probably why it was lost. Then it became one of the most fun comedy series that the BBC has ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character was very fun, and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. Christmas offerings were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show stopped when starring Gary Olsen played Bill died, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP <br /> <br /> This undervalued show has unfortunately disappeared from our TV screens and is not repeated so often - Although it appears on UKTV Gold occasionally, but it should be repeated on BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
