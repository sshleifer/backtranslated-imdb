As the series goes "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the best action series of the 1930s. Made in a period when the studios could still mark a large cast, this has a wall-to-wall action throughout its 12 chapters. In 1824, the president of the newly-formed Mexico Mexico, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young), was trying to put his new country on a solid economic basis. For this purpose, he has arranged to have rich gold shipments forwarded to the capital from the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the municipal plan to steal the shipments on behalf of the Don-del-Oro a gold-armored god who, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, hope to install themselves as ruler in Mexico. Opposite him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who is a legion of locals to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is murdered by Don-del-Oros men, a stranger, Don Diego's (Reed Hadley) volunteer comes to town. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The piece's heroine is Ramon's sister Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon hold seats on local ruling counseling. It soon turns out that some of the other members of the Council are in the league with the Don-del-Oro. First there is the President-in-Office of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the leader of the military Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows is more haunting by Zorro and his associations from the supporters of the Don del Oro. We have the collapsing rope bridge present, the deep ravine between two rocks, where only Zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and carts crashes or climbs over the rock. Hats from here to the Republic's fine team of stunt men led by the legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his signature stunt jump on a team of running horses and then falls under the coach, which he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stagecoach" that year. <br /> <br /> No matter how Zorro finally paints the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before they run into the sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Others in the cast are Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro and if you look close, you can spot bits on future series and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stuntman Canutt in bits. "Big" Jim Pierce, by the way, can best be remembered for playing Tarzan in the 1927 "Tarzan and Golden Liom" (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burrough's daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Enjoyable.
