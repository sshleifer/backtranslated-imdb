I have recently seen I.Q. And although I'm not a romantic comedy type gal, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many movies in my opinion lack honesty. You know that feeling when you watch a movie, and you just feel robbed because it takes something from the story, and it was like the director just threw it together, as if it were the trash bin? The story between the researchers is a sweet and fun one. How they get stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbin's character become wise. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and produced a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems". I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
