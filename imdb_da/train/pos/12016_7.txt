Good western filmed in Rocky Arizona Wilds. Lots of hard guys all the way through; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a backward type. Several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to compensate for the fact that it was exciting and worth seeing. A really stupid scene shows that Heston empties .45 cases of their powder and collects it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. In order to collect as much spice, he would have needed a packing mug to carry the ammunition. B. Of course, the grass was dry: why not just drop a fight on it and let's tear?
