The movie starts very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, a companion on a photo-service drop-off station. His wife has been confined to her home with an ankle bracelet due to a sentence for arson. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes firefighting seriously. <br /> <br /> When we see Wallace's rather boring life cycle, something new and sudden suddenly comes: a travel carnival comes to town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> It also does Wallace. They are both pyrokineticists or "pyrotics", people who can start burning through mental energy. Wallace keeps his forces secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to a childhood event where they accidentally caused a vagrant's death. Wallace holds back from using his powers; Wilder wants to be public on national television. <br /> <br /> Complicating the case, Wilder Wallace's wife, as they both dated years earlier, wants. She becomes a complaint and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal fire. <br /> <br /> The movie is entertaining but not laugh-amazing fun. I think enough about having a copy in my library. It's a good offbeat movie.
