Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to his older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fall in love with their neighbor Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them separate and that their love for each other will never fade away. This was really a heartbreaking story of first love. Probably the most painful story of young love I've ever seen. All plays are amazing, and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first movie. I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
