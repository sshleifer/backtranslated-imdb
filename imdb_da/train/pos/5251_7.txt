Well "Wayne's World" is far away and the years since then have been difficult for snl off-shoot movies. From such cinematic slaughter waste as "It's Pat" to the last 80-minute curse, "A Night at the Roxbury", many undoubtedly have lost the belief that other snl shit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. Don't be afraid because Tim Meadows comes through in spades. The well-written plot maintains audience interest for the end, and while still true to the Leon Phelps character, introduced in five minutes of filth, history gives the character to evolve. humor (largely composed of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than I have in any movie in the latest memory. It's just a good time if you don't want to take yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of "Saved by the Bell" fame, looks in the movie and looks amazing. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the film a touch of class. And for those out there, there are thoughtless movie quotes like myself, you will find this movie for unique quote, "Oh, it's a lady!"
