Breathtaking. Absolutely amazing. This is a movie about two children whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims an angel visits him and tells him to kill "demons." He gets instructions later, and they begin to round off the demons, which to ordinary people are ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head and chop them and bury them in the rose garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a twist at the end. What I love about this movie is that it completely captures the weakness of human perception. Is their father totally angry? Or does he tell the truth? The audience is back to decide. Go do the judgment for yourself and watch the movie. Now.
