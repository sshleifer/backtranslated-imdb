The "day ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways it is better than "close meetings of the third kind." (I prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) Special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this movie. It is probably one of the best roles he has ever had in a function. the musical score is very good. The story doesn't make sense. BUT IT ONLY DOES ALL MORE INTRIGUING. Like many of the best works of art, the "day ended" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "Day Time Ended" can be a low budget indie movie, but it is not too much of a stretch to compare with the "existential" European films from the 50s and 60s. (many of which were independent low-budget productions.)
