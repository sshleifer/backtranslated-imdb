I can honestly say that I never expected this movie to be good. I don't like family movies. I'm far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last film (MPKDH was complete stupidity. And the music was very boring and bland. But there was Amrita Rao who has become my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher who are very talented. So, a few pluses. <br /> <br /> Finally, I watched the movie and I was very impressed, bringing us the young MPK lovers with a knife in the HAHK wedding and we have a winner. In the beginning, the serious condition at the end, the director also made character that you could relate to. What I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. The molding adds to Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance, it is a great improvement, and most importantly he fits in. The best thing is easy Amrita Rao, in fact, this is her best performance. Her screen presence is so electrifying you are bound to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, A n upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are thrown amazing. Not an actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but they sound better after seeing them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are good ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to see. The songs are not colorful and dancey, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who is obliged to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the mistake in the movie? The movie gets rather slow and the end is quite stretched. But the film is still at a good pace, making it a perfect family movie.
