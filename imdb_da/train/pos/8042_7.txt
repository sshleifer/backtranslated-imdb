**** SPOILERS **** The movie "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploitation of the legendary US Marine sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. The unpleasant soft-talking Mister Rogers look-alike, running up to a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese military kills during his two walks in the "Nam". Who shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a cold clam and deadly like Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who is at the end of his career as a top US Marine sniper, but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be meaningless. As there is nothing outside of him to do with his skills, which he learned in the American mariners, unless he decides to become a mob hitman. Backett reluctantly receives his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the help of former sharpshooter silver medal and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, is being sent deep into Panama's jungle. The two snipers must take rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa and the Colombian drug king-pin Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who supports him in a planned military takeover of the country. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett's scope and take a rebel leader who I feel was the best scene in "Sniper". For it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a sub-plot that was later interrupted in the film of a rebel sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who stalked Beckett and who later killed Papich when they both waited to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter . You would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse were played between the two who would culminate when the movie ended, but Sgt. Beckett had no trouble sending DeSilva early in the film using an unsuspecting Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> The wounded movie was most ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a shot of a killing sniper movie to a Rambo-like end with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller are fighting for a whole battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth considering that it tells the story of a person who until now it has not really been glamorized in war movies: A lone killer who kills with a master diamond cutter or finish neurosurgeon, and who does it in secret.
