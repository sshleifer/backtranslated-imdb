Although most people see the movie, it will be of little interest, but out of the hundreds of films dealing with magic and occult in some form, this is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <From The Golem to The Craft topic seems to be endless interest in the film industry. The majority of films that touch it in any way make it so childish (for example, "Witchboard", a true piece of complete waste in every way) either to take the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or papermaking (cf "Warlock" ). More often, the subject arises in a hysterical religious context (in the various revelational-oriented films, the antichrist is inevitably a spokesman for some sort of contemporary-style practice). Rarely does a movie seem to show at least some passing experiences of magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or ... just not completely true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again after many years tonight. I had seen it before on VHS; It's a dark and moody piece, and after I've seen it on DVD, I want to say if you want to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, don't watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> Dark and mood are overwhelming in VHS, but in DVD, the movie takes a completely different tone. I think Weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally into style, but when the film is converted to VHS's lower color medium, it goes over the edge. DVD brings the movie to life again and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I saw it as for the first time, I realized that magic treatment is extremely good in this movie. It's hard to go into all the reasons why I don't care to take the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious yet, if you want to see how it is in real life, this movie is just really right at countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for anyone who isn't, you wasted a lot of time reading to this point.
