"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime of Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, not just a comedy, but also an action animation. The main character of history is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an agreement between both fathers who are good friends and trained together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most violent sister of Tendo's: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is middle and loves to win money no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when it is splashed with cold water, as well as his father becomes a panda , many new signs and situations begin to happen. They also discover the reason for the transformation: Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river, but not only did they have this kind of fate ... <br /> If you saw '' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked , I recommend you '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku '', two other great creations from Rumiko's hands.
