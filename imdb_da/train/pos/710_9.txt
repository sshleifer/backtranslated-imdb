Although I do not agree with Bob's and Tammy's decision to give up baby Jesse and that is something I would never do, they tried to do what was best for the child. The way this movie is written sees you being wrapped up in history and asking yourself what you really believe in from all the different aspects. Patty Duke? Opponent? Almost unheard of as far as I'm concerned. But during the film, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least there is something seriously wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The movie seems to end quickly and leaves something unresolved. But apart from that, this movie is truly amazing. It makes you think. It is not a movie to see when you just want to kick and relax and see something sweet that makes you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and discover a little about yourself. Caution: You can even grow while watching this movie! And it's all worth it, at last.
