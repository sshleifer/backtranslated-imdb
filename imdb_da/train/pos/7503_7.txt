The movie was okay, quite entertaining. The cast was pretty good, and I would probably see what the comment for me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was excellent and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played the selfish "evil" friend and the band's leader brilliantly! <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but it doesn't really come as a surprise considering the movie is a VH1 production. But if soft rock / pop music is not for the taste of others, you can just as well flash these scenes. <br /> <br /> A plot of a band trying to make it to the top of LA but having to overcome many obstacles on the road is not too original but rather entertaining, with some surprising plot facing here and there.
