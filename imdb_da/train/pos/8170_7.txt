As if most people did not already have a scary view of the dentist, this little movie will definitely get you paranoid patients. A successful dental practitioner testifies that his wife goes down to the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) And grabs a lot of time in a raging collapse. After shooting an attack dog upside down, he goes into work and ends up taking his civilian aggression on the patients as he plans what to do with his "slum" of a wife. There are lots of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tuna cutting and beauty queen fondling, as well as a wonderfully horrified performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene where he ties up and gasses his wife before he easily tears her teeth is hard to see. A dentist is definitely the wrong kind of person to go out into the deep end, and this film explains it in detail. The "dentist" is incredibly entertaining, quick and frightening at times. Check it out!
