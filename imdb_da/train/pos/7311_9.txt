Halloween is a movie, I have to come out and see every time it is that day of the year. I see it at times when it's not the holiday !!! This movie is so great. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress, I can never stop loving. This movie can be old, but the storyline still gets me right there every time, and the play was amazing !!! Although I haven't seen the remake, I already feel that it was completely unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should have never recreated such a classic. What kills myself is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing the original. I get furious just thinking about it !!!!!! This movie was great and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
