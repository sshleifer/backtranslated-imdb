Radiofreccia is a film about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addiction, our fears. It's a brilliant movie where a group of friends like us all have life through the difficulties of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades of the last century. The movie does not take a happy or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story that we could all have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sorrow and sorrow. The power of this story is that we grow to love the characters, it is one of the movies you will see again and again, and feel closer to the small town of Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping someday to finally be able to walk his streets off Freccia and his friends and listen to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio that played Radio Raptus International and played their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia makes you laugh, it makes you cry sometimes, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take you away. Personally, I believe in having played an important role in my life and my friends, and I suggest you all see it and let it be a part of yours.
