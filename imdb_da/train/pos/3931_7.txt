A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln's early years from director John Ford, concentrating primarily on an experiment in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film presents an interesting portrayal of this important American figure and the film is well made, but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that while I admired the depiction, it just wasn't as satisfying as I think it could have been with a greater extent. In Abraham Lincoln's role, we have Henry Fonda, who effectively shows a calm strength. Fonda's achievements include some gangly mannerisms and other affectations that are quite effective at presenting a depiction of Lincoln, especially when combined with some effective makeup and costuming, which is occasionally a little obvious. <br /> <br /> The supportive cast is solid and surprisingly does not include many of Ford's regular support casts (sometimes referred to as his corporation), but we have Ward Bond one of the most productive character actors in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in several AFI Top 100 Films than any other actor, both the original and revised list. He has also appeared in 11 best pictured. <br /> <br /> The movie has a scene that seems to have inspired a rather similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird" where it would be made even better than it is here, even though this scene is one of The most effective in this movie.
