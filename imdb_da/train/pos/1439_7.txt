CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Share vignettes of NYC political life and share moralizing narrative. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque Boss with presidential dreams, often gives times or bad performances. There are a few times when he chews the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL this is where he shines. John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without entering the caricature of a New Orleans dialect or slipping into the melodrama during the film's climax. Danny Aiello as a political chief is also very good. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The big problem with CITY HALL and it's a good movie in many ways is the general sense of lack of momentum. It comes out more like a documentary than a movie picture. We see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective, and of course the viewer is not involved. When the viewer does not get involved to any degree, they become apathetic to the characters, and eventually plotted. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate and what should have been a riveting, details that reveal the final, came out as a "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They tell you "Can't fight the town hall," as the tread worn cliche goes. Still, it still can't stop you from thinking about what might have been if they had just amplified the manuscript and pacing of this movie.
