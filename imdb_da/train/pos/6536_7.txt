Let's face it; Nancy Drew was never great literature. It is in the same category as babysitter club, magical wooden house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. It was actually one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "nice", has no internal conflicts ever! and never changes. Down is pretty much the same. The movie was true to that style and I must say I liked it. It will never be a good movie, but it had the same nostalgic taste as the books held. It just had the right amount of excitement for my kids (8 and 10.) There was hardly any offensive language. I liked the push for more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a little annoyed. He was a little out of place on a high school campus. I never quite got why he was there in the first place.
