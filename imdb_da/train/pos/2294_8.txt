... Hawk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and by extension French actors / actresses. At worst, it is an indulgence that actors get bitch on other actors, questioning the validity of acting as a profession at all, etc. At best, it is a brilliant celebration / send-up of some of the finest actors currently working. From a simple prerequisite - Jean-Pierre Marisel's request that water be ignored in a restaurant - Spinning in all directions and allowing the French cinema cream to stretch their stuff before the camera itself throws nods to those who no longer around (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura), including the director's father, Bernard, one of the great stalwarts of French cinema, from whom he marks a celestial phone at the end of the film. Discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as charged, but also some of a guilty pleasure.
