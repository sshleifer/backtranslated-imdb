Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller from 1990, published here in the UK on the "New World Video" label. It's a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends partying at the weekend, only to be knocked off one by one by an unknown force driving a threatening black truck !!! This movie has some scary scenes and some go here and there, but I have to say that the actor was so boring even at low budget standards! But the film was strangely addictive and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or swallowed it, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but as it built up steam along the way, had some good moments of gore and excitement, had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the primary female role was also a hottie! I give it 7/10.
