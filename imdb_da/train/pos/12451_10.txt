Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and saw it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that it has never made enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a movie so true to the comics and books like My Name, is Modesty, with another tough female management, anyone who is not familiar with the character, see this as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological excitement than action players. <br /> <br /> The will of the will between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is exciting, exciting and fascinating for anyone who does not have to do and explode. Alexandra did a good job of playing how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this especially in front of the basket after the much needed reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two bad past efforts, although not so well known to the public, this is really a restart of the Modesty character, and it is really sad that there will probably be no more films about her.
