Again, Stacy Peralta is true to the people who lived the story first. By letting the people involved in the formation of big wave surfing tell us their stories, how it felt and what they thought, you get the feeling of being there. The film takes you from the fifties to the nearest present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the development and development of the sport. Candidate "home video" as videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a clean view of the participants' athleticism and fabulous large wave images will give you a full perspective on this aspect of surfing. It's worth seeing.
