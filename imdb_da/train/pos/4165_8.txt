No, this scary terrible 70's tailor-made clinker is not about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. Yet, this exceptionally awful, but inevitably entertaining and so entertaining cathode ray reaches an amazing apex of absolute, incessant silliness and horror that is quite tasty in such an execrable-it's-downright-awesome way. Richard Crenna, who looks and may be confused, and Yvette Mimieux, who seems like she never came across the brutal rape she endured in "Jackson County Prison", barely shows a scary and respectable suburban couple whose picturesque, boring, Sleepy little town existence is torn down when the sweet German shepard they enter, as the family livestock turns out to be some old mortal evil spirits. Almost soon, Mimieux and her two frightening children Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien mops of Disney "Witch Mountain" images) worship a crude drawing of the unpleasant, nasty dog ​​unit in the hen. Boy, is it not really scary and disturbing now? Good, scary and disturbing in this ridiculously ridiculous clapping step is not certain, but it's certainly fun thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, comic (not so) special effects, an almost painful risible'n'ridiculous plot and a gambling battle struggling with the absurd story (besides the leaders discover both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong cards as members of a satanic cult, and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). The favorite scene: The malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on the Crenna, almost forcing him to hold his hand in a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. While stuck-up snobby fright movie fans can keep their nose on the utterly eerie stench of this admirably smelly schlock, devout TV waste lovers should consider this endearingly offensive offal boob tube similar to Alpo.
