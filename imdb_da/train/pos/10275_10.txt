Get ready for it: This is one of my favorite movies all the time. I am relatively unaware of David Mamet's (author and instructor) other works, but having seen this movie half a dozen times (it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he's a genius. This film is extremely well-written and quickly draws you into its environment of fraud, contemporary art and back room hustle. The film's feeling is very similar to The Sting (1973), and it also gives tribute to film noir. It is quite a psychologically complex movie and will surely make you think of the different plot designs and motifs of the shady characters. It's a bit predictable at times, but the shocking climax is always exciting to see. <br /> <br /> In general, the play is amazing - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I watched the movie noticed that having a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) is not a good idea. gambler, a smoker and a thief, but also sports a bad 80's hairstyle. I agree, but I think she is still excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, like Mamet's latest movie, The Spanish Prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
