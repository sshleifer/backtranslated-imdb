I watched this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was thoroughly fascinated for all 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but often find them pulling for about 25 minutes. However, the Forbidden Lie $ never ran my interest. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the release of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of a sort of Muslim friend of her who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, a few journalists started knocking gaps in history, leading the public to believe that it was fraud. The film covers this quickly but thoroughly at the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time with Norma, as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with Khoury as she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent setbacks over the eerie portrait, her Roman paintings from Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broinowski, however, is not discouraged and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look inside a designer. What we find here, of course, has no particular meaning and is extremely difficult to follow, and in the end we do not know whether we should believe in Norma or not. She is either a rather unfair woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The web of lies, truths and half truths she turns through the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The movie uses a lot of interviews, as well as dramatizations to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we'll be fooled. We go to the cinema every day and allow us to believe what is happening on the screen is real. It may just be me, I read into things a little too much, it didn't come in Q&A with Brionowski after the movie, but that was what I took away from it. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian movie and will receive an international release and a swag of award if you ask me. Definitely the best movie I saw on AFF07. <br /> <br /> See if you get the chance.
