There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew from the relief ship that he doesn't dare to dream about. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since then, he married another expedition member and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people left on this planet who once were a home of an ancient civilization known as Krell. The plates deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that Krell came to a disastrous end of unknown origin. The machine they left still works. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it seems too good, as members of the relief party are beginning to die and in a particularly cruel way. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about a remake, and it's a movie not to be restored because it is as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms will change, we will now say chain speed in instead of hyperdrive, thanks to the continued popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see the men in relief expedition in a flying saucer as a spaceship. It may look much more like Starship Enterprise or Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It is interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how future perceptions change. The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play God. /> <br /> You can't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby Robot. This mechanical wonder, composed of Pidgeon with the knowledge he got from studying Krell, was quite hit back in the day. He got a new lease for life in the sixties with the character of the robot from Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman, who plays the chef on the spacecraft and his respect for Earl's request for some home spirits, are very fun. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Ten Commandments and Farewells from the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet is unfortunate to face a Hollywood founder such as Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> Classics among you will recognize the Forbidden Planet as a futuristic rework of Tempest, which when you think it could have been Shakespeare's venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among cast is Warren Stevens, whose victim gives Leslie Nielsen the opportunity to learn exactly what he has to do with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this when sent.
