Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a cinematic sequel to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. Fusion is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I nurtured it with some caution. His brilliant productions from the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. The director's former film had colorful characters and offered close observations of life - often in the Long Island, New York region or in New York City itself - it was scary and insightful. <br /> <br /> My first caution came from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". To my pleasing surprise, Hartley manages to gather his well-established style and focus on producing a very original drama of international intrigue. It works in several ways than you might imagine. Hartley's film preserves the dialogue and character focus that are his trademarks, along with an outstanding cinematic style. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is highly appropriate in view of the current situation in the world and the war state that has been promoted by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worth mentioning in the same breath as Syriana. He really comes into his own. The cast does a good job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more mature and beautiful than before.
