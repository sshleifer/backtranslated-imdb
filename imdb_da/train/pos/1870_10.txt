This movie is amazing! It touched my cold heart. I couldn't relate to the racial discrimination that Antwone has experienced because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We saw this movie in our sociology class at New Era University and I didn't know it was a true story I thought it was just created by an intellectual who wants to bring fresh air into industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (who was only six). If I were on his shoes, I could have jumped a ten-story tall building. I greet him for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that moved me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not beat her or anything, instead he told her about the achievements he had in the long years that they were separated. (I think I do that when I get the chance to track my roots.)
