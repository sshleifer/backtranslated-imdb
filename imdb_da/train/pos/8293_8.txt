As a 90 minute experience it is not up to the standard of `Drive ', as the actors clearly taught their trade at' Who Am I? 'academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the amazing Mark Dacascos beat' em-up. But those who enjoyed 'Drive' (and I thought it was great!) Will undoubtedly enjoy this as well. You will certainly not rewind to the start and see it all over again, but you will definitely return to some of the action scenes for a long time to come. It is refreshing to see that Quality Campaign is still being practiced, even though it is not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys could do with budgets, time and respect as yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei yield. If you sit through the first half hour and aren't crazy about the dreadful dialogue, then you're in the goodies. Bosch is magnificent and can really bust a feature with some magnificent acrobatics, kicks and simple actions of bravery. <br /> <br /> If you're lucky to be within 500 miles of a copy, then track it down and see it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less articulated than Coolio in the `China Strike Force ', but you will be impressed by both the movements shown and the pain felt by the stunt - (I'm pretty sure there is no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to push a wooden roof with a speed car!?). <br /> <br />
