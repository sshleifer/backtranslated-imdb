George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swears in a ditch. But what seems to be a simple occurrence of accidents is the start of a scary journey where the myth becomes reality and a meat-eating spirit, half-animal and half-man Wendigo, mocks a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror movies that are often tenderfoot in a bleak family drama. The action is amazing, the characters are well-developed, and there are some bone-cooling moments. The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled efficiently, and it is never clear what is genuine and what is imagined, or even if the story is entirely in Miles head.Overall, "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and will completely Certainly not be the last. Give this movie a chance if you don't mind seeing something unconventional.8 out of 10.
