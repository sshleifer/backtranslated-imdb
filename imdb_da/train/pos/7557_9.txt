Gender Bender Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out it's both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> in one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great season 1 episode. I enjoy this because the story is the kind where you will never be sure what will happen next time. It is completely original. Teaser is very fun with the eye's proximity and reflection of the disco lights. I really need to teach myself that the thumb, the genitals he does. I really like the atmosphere of Kindred's small village, and Mulder and Scully sneak around in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite season 1 episodes indeed. I think the thing I like about it so much is how they turn out to be foreigners in the end and left crop circles. Many people see this as a non-mythology-related alien episode such as "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this could easily be seen as mythology related. Perhaps the gender bender was like the alien hunter and could look like someone. Huh? Anyway, I give the episode a 9 out of 10.
