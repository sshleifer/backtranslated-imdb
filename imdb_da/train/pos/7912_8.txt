These things have flopped around in my head for fucking nearly 10 years now. Some pieces of this work were truly memorable. - Id loves to see another more current example of cg flashy offy stuff. In fact, I'd like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had the chance to just say what I wanted and thats it, I wouldn't have to write all that extra to be able to make "10 lines of text" as this site requires. I really mean? This almost discourages me, fortunately I mean for the guys who made the movie, I really liked Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to have enough lines, I hope you don't make me spell. - You did it.
