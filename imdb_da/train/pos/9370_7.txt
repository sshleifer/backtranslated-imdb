I had never heard of this movie before I saw what I was wondering if it was an independent movie and I was real, but with a good throw I decided to have it. Basically Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh) he gets a huge amount of money, wrong for a hitman he has hired to Kill his incredible wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, take the money and go to warn Suzanne, and after making him a victim, he decides to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chokes Michael and shoots a big gun until he comes by car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the hit man he lost, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne and knows that they are both in danger, they plan to leave town and add another complication by falling to each other. Before leaving, Suzanne insists they go and steal a large sum of money in the safe. Of course, things won't go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up with them, and Lyle forces them and now ties Wayne to go and get the buried money. Eventually, both Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne on the train, but it is clear that she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves. Also with Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytck, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, except perhaps a lame Boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good movie noir for a black comedy thriller. Very good!
