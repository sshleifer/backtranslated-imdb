This movie has always been a favorite for me since he first saw it as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when it appeared on a Los Angeles television station's "late show". The characters are very engaging from the start of the picture, and it is too bad that the film has never been released for videotape, and it is never shown on television (apparently due to a ban from Moss Hart's property, the dramatist / producer / director who wrote the story and first presented it on the New York scene during World War II - the reason for denying viewing is hard to understand more than 50 years after it was made). I couldn't watch the movie again for more than 30 years, as a person who had actually been a big movie participant in the movie could get me a "bootlegged" copy on VHS (poor video quality, but good sound). My memory of it was correct: it was still an exciting and fascinating movie to watch. An amazing aspect of this movie is just how many of its stars, just beginning in their career at the time of 1944, became either big movie stars or at least well-known and full-time actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien , Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are great, especially the close-ups, where the details of the giant (for these times) 4-engine bombs (then 18,000 + manufactured, now almost extinct) can be seen. Good insight into the different levels of education that a pilot cad went through to be assigned a bomber (of course, much gender as it was today's development: only the men became pilots, the women just supported them in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). One day I hope it will be released for video for a new generation to enjoy.
