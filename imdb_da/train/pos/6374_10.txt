Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways, it had a better story than the other films aimed at a higher age. Although this movie sought a solid attention span at times. It was a fantastic movie for all ages. I noticed some of the younger crowd expected a comedy, but got a fairy tale. I think everyone is tired of an infinite parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have seen nothing but parodies. After a short while, everyone was very keen to see Atlantis.
