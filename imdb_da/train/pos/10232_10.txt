Having seen most of Ringo Lamb's movies I can say that this is his best movie to date and the most unusual. It is an ancient china period that is crammed full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays a major role as any of the characters. The action is amazing, the story is exciting and entertaining, and the set design is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and it is almost impossible to get your mitts on, even if you are approaching the second largest Chinese city in North America (as I do). If you can find it, don't give it up.
