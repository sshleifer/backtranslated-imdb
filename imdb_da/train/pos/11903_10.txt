I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially William Castle's gimmicks, so it was definitely a must-see for me. <br /> <br /> It's about William Castle's life and work, which, in my opinion, was an underrated director. True, he made some cheap budget-screaming horror movies, but he added something to these movies: real live theater gimmicks that you can no longer see. For example, he had nurses if someone had a heart attack on his films and put vibrators on the bottom of chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is really a well-established documentary and brings this rather shady director into the light and celebrated his contribution to the horror movie theater. It also paints the castle as a greater than life character, which was very well-liked and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movie documents that mostly show wills from movie historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. One should look for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
