Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this movie worthwhile. Bo, who is more beautiful than ever, is a recent widowed woman who experiences visits from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must acquire a young man's body so her ghost in a man can make his conversion from ghosts back to the lively life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How will she do him so Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> With Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, Quinn's movie presence and, thanks to John, a very beautiful exotic look to the whole movie, this movie is pleasing viewing.
