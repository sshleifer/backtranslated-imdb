This film is one of the few quality films in 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the movie is excellent as it is both Turturro and Watson. Turturro gives his best performance to date and shows that he is worth more than we thought. Watson also does great. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro) who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with several setbacks of Luzhin's childhood. Through them, Luzhin's complex character is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say but to suggest this movie to anyone.
