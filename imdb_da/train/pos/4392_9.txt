I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance like Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines throughout the movie. He was also very good at this too, although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before. The movie gets you involved in the characters and really makes you doubt about what's going to happen to them all. I didn't know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did pretty well. Lots of exciting scenes. A thoroughly good trip. I'm definitely a fan of Maguire's. Check out the Cider House Rules. One of the best of all time ever.
