The more I see Nicholas Cage, the more I value him as an actor. When you watch this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that came out in the early 90s. I don't really think it can be considered a movie noir, but it is pretty dark at times, mainly because of the character's light and odd personalities. Typical performances from each of the three main actors, all of which did a good job of their roles. However, I thought Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped as it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did it. Hopper is a love for him or hates him kind of guy. The reason is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to leave it to the director (ie when he first saw the sheriff). All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
