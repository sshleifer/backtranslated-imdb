I've seen this movie a number of times and found it very good. This movie is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Kill of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful / scary self. George Riviere, the male leader, does a good job with his role. The whole film drips with the atmosphere, and there are a lot of tensions through. The camera's angles are good and the play is mostly not bad. This movie is perfectly suited for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD version unknown, which is far better than the edited TV version. Take some popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
