Lily Powers works on a speakeasy until her father dies. She then goes to New York to work in an office building. There she notes that if she wants to get something higher, she must give the men what they want. And what men want is her ... well you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a film with high sexual content. For a movie in that era, anyway. This was one of the last Pre-Code films made. Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily. Other film actors are George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie deals with a brave topic, and it does well. Baby Face is historically significant film and therefore good to see.
