Unfortunately, 8 simple rules to participate in my teenage daughter were the last sitcom John Ritter had to work on after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my very first favorite actors. He had it all, comedy (which can forget him in Three's Company), but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (unforgettable to watch TV movies). So much I loved all the other cast members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was the STAR, he was much of the reason I was drawn to the show in the first place, and that was his perfect comedy delivery that could break me up every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show wasn't all pretty sweet (as much as I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were too cozy to each other lol) they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly. It was realistic enough with all sibling rivalries and parental differences, but they still kept it fun. Many American sitcoms are trying to fill the shows completely with morals and what not, and this show did not. Yes, there were some who were addressing important issues, such as Fabrics and bullying, but they did not try to be anything but a fun family comedy. How they wrote John's death to Vis was done brilliantly, I still spin like a baby every time I see it. You could feel how raw the emotions were during these incredibly hard episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry the show was canceled, I still enjoy watching reruns and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you are always remembered for your hilarious portrayal of this protective father, who would rather unlock his daughters in their room than they date a boy =) You rock Ritter !!!
