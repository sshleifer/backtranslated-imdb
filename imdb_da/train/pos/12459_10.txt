This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of that kind. The interaction between respectable and morally indestructible characters is an ode to knightly art and the code of honor among thieves and policemen. It deals with issues such as duty, guilt, words, manipulation and trust as few films have done, and unfortunately none that I can remember since the death of the death year in the late 70s. The sequence is delicious, down to the essence, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without the extraordinary eye-catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller copies of the genre to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or necessary. The argument is powerless and honest to the spectator, which is an important asset in a genre that tension is often achieved through public confusion. No, this is not to miss Marble ... A note of congratulations on the music is okay A movie to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
