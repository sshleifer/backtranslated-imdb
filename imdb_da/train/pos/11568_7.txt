One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American movie guests during World War II, shows Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" a hobo flea set on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little guy becomes a real sadist while he makes a home on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "An extra scwatch and I give you a bath!" Meanwhile, the flea flies up to the dog! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in a scene, Elmer reads a cartoon with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Of course, Elmer and Bugs have often appeared, but Elmer has never played with Porky (unless you count the very short "Any Bond Today"). But for me, the idea of ​​Elmer about these other famous characters from his same genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as though he knew about their existence in his universe, even though they are not shown in this cartoon. <Br /> <br /> Of course I probably go too far in my analysis. I'm sure the comic was meant to be pure entertainment and it certainly entertains. As for "I might like this" line, it sounds like it was something that the censors would not have allowed but somehow missed; First, I don't really know what it should sound like. Was it something sexual? At the end I had thought I had seen everything I would have been tempted to look for more than doing what the cat did (though it was a good trick). <br /> <br /> * The boys behind these cartoons probably had something for TNT, right?
