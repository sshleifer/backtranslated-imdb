It was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. This makes every show I've ever seen looked boring. The moment the first episode broadcast I was entranced and I was so stuck to all the characters (which usually never happens because I always hate a few characters). It's a shame that this show doesn't have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen, and it doesn't exaggerate my feelings to the show at all. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies, for what could ABC find out to replace this show? This is easily the best show on TV. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and I continued because I fell in love with the whole show.
