8 Simple Rules is a fun show, but it also has some life lessons, especially a mature lesson about moving forward after a lost one, which was the episode where Paul died, which was the first episode I have ever seen on the show coming on. ABC. The Hennessy clan - the mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look after each other for guidance and support after Paul's death (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) borrow a hand. I'm happy later in the 2nd season of this show, they decided to put David Spade in this show when he finished the NBC series Just Shoot Me! But everything and everything this show is pretty good. This show reminds me of a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that were previously on ABC.
