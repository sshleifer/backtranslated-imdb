Eight simple rules started out as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Kerry is unique and I can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction , her character was in later series. Early episodes were fun, good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate disciplining the kids, but I think the show lost it sparkle when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wanting to continue the series, but when he died, I felt the program did. For me, the whole point of the show was based on the guide of the 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter. It was written by a real man with teenage daughters, and the relevance and viewing angle had changed without Hennessey's father. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to be more annoying, Rory remained the same, and Cate always gave her offspring life lessons, which before seemed to be more fun when it was all back to Paul. I think Grandma is fun (especially when he sees big flight) but feels C.J is unnecessary for the show. He is fun in parts but I felt the stories at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. Over all the newer ones are not bad, just lacking excitement and others find it annoying that Cate works at school and C.J and Grandfad are always there? I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong in the beginning and well worth looking at for Paul and Kerry, but later they were on average about average.
