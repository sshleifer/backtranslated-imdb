Excellent farce! Of course, that's all it is supposed to be. Fortunately, there is neither social nor political communication, nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction. Could the plot actually take or has taken place at a particular time or place? It is not likely, because it is simply a film and film that comes from fantasy, not from reality. The only goal of this movie is to entertain, certainly not to educate, and entertain it does, with the reality lovely and light-hearted thrown to the winds. I think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for entertainment I want what is described today as a "no-brainer", as The Mating Game is in every respect. For a few chuckles and an uninterrupted laugh now and then it's fine fare.
