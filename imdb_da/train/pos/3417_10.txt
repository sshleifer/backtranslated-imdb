Before I saw this, I was cut off from the subject, but this is not your average triumph of adversity history. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there's so much more to it. This film shows the very strong, often conflicting personalities of two high performing blind adults who lead the children Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind mountaineer / athlete, and Sabriye is a blind German graduate who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both unusual in their own ways, but disagree on what really will trust the children. Erik wants them to reach the summit, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and welcome the moment. The nuances are complicated and you go away and are not really sure who was right or if the whole rise was a mistake or a good idea. The most in-depth scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they face before they find their way to school. The most moving for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up in the street after his parents left him. I could see a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he now runs a successful little business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you will love this.
