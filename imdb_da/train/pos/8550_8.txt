Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great only for Seann William Scott's performance as a Stifler, but after the quality has dropped. Band Camp kept the standard relatively high with characters you actually cared about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot lines reused (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). It had some entertaining moments like the football match against midgets and "punishment" by Coozeman, but in all that lacked the originality and "Mile" was just stupid and moronic. Not to mention the annoying girlfriend who doesn't want sex. <br /> <br /> Still enough about Naked Mile. I saw the Beta House with fear when I thought it could take the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot, but it is filled with hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes aplenty. Yes it is formal and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exciting performance. The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and last events, while Christopher McDonald's cameo is fun. However, there are weak points. Coozeman is as annoying as he was in the first, I am still amazed at how he has ever participated. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch, but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low. First of all, he lacks charisma, a Stifler premise. You really can't worry less about him. The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on the screen! She shines over him like the rest of the casting. Seriously, John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has just as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> Saying the movie is entertaining and Coozeman is afraid that his girl is not exactly a girl is great fun. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is worth hiring, getting some of your buddies in and grabbing the vomit and spitting your anger on Erik 'loser' Stifler.
