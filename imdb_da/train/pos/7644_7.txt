Jim Belushi is great as the "average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar bid that not only listens to Belushi's "story" but has a "cure" for all Belushi's middle-class problems: a magic potion to create an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> Flashbacks show a 15-year horrible shame about causing his High School Baseball Team's Championship defeat. Belushi continues his "pitiful life", apparently happy, but always wondering "what if ..." What seems to be several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of tremendous success, admired and hated by others in equal measure. <br /> <br /> It's not quite "It's a wonderful life", but some elements are alike and very appealing. "Ending" is predictable, but still satisfactory. Beware of a very young Cortney Cox in a part like "lethal attraction" -like other woman. A very comfortable movie!
