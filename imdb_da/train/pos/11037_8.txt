Now I know that French inmates probably haven't read Lovecraft (and it shows me that his writings should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how did they seem to sound like "ftagn yog sototh" may lead to something good? <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cellmates stumble upon a magic book that can, if they read correctly, get them out. As prisons go, the cell was completely unrealistic, so it made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves slowly, which can carry people. But apart from that, this top edge is scary feeling, blending Sartre's "hell's other people" with a Lovecraft / Barker-type story, and doing it successfully. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Take the time to see this. It does not mean doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or at the same time do something else. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Teaching to learn: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
