Made me think about it in days after seeing it. That for me is the character of a fantastic movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I am tired of these people who demand these good Hollywood cookie-cutter endings. I plan to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but regardless of the movie's emotional messages were completely felt.
