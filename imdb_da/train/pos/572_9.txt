In response to the person who made the remark about how the film draws, and who believed, there was no purpose in the role of Jess's brother. Here's my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to provide some sort of dramatic irony in history. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have anticipated the problems associated with living life fully by looking at how Jess's brother appeared. There are various cases where Brad Pitt and his life run parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a conflicting bar, and subsequently finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so Craig Sheffer's character would have a greater emotional turmoil at the death of his brothers, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and later create a more convincing mood in the movie.
