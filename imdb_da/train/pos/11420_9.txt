This film is about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-changing boundaries of morals, race and desire. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no car gates, no buildings are exploding, no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by gaze, minimal gesture, spatial boundaries, lighting and things left behind - sometimes very apparently - invisible. It's about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the search motives of themselves and others, identity, desire, boundaries and losses. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will spoil those whose palates require explosive, massive, spicy action. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That's all.
