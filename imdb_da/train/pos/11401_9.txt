An American in Paris was in many ways the ultimate mix of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the height of MGM's powers as a musical power plant, the movie features memorable music from Gershwins, which has rightly been called the 20th century equivalent to Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the height of his efforts in this movie, although it could rightly be argued that this movie was only warming to its best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). The two films are actually closely linked. Apart from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway Melody segment of "Rain" is due to its existence in the incredible American in the Paris Ballet sequence of this movie. It may well have been the only time a dance figure is mentioned specifically in the film's opening credits. And it deserved to be because it shows Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost extent. The movie's cast is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, who makes her movie debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she's been making movies for years. Her initial dance sequence, and later her work on the ballet, gives some surprisingly sexy moments rival in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse's work in Singin 'in Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly's stoic pal, who gets two of the movie's best moments: in the play of the play (which I won't give away to anyone who hasn't seen the movie) and one of the movie's most memorable songs that pair his incredible piano skills with the latest technology (currently). <br /> <br /> Less memorable is Georges Guetary as Kelly's romantic rival, though he gets some musical highlights and Nina Foch as Leslie Aaron's romantic rival. May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina reminded me of the same "held man" relationship between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are a few elements in the movie that made it less satisfying for me than Singin 'in the rain. The ballet, although lavish and well-produced, does not really fit in with the rest of the film. Without renouncing the plot, the ballet just happens without real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre. <br /> <br /> Making matters worse is the end of the movie that happens immediately after the ballet. Although the end should not be a surprise (this is a MGM musical, after all), I hoped a little more ... movie after the ballet ended. It's like director Vincente Minnelli felt he couldn't follow Ballet with anything else. The movie literally left me. <br /> <br /> This negative side is rightly an American in Paris along with the best of Hollywood musicals. It doesn't quite reach the heights of Singin 'in the rain, but it comes close, and it is a testament to Gene Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers at all times.
