Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil law attorney who starts a criminal case in "The Unknown Man", a 1951 film that also contributed to Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great belief in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case that defends a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) accused of murder and acquitted him. Shortly after, he realizes that the man is guilty and extorted from his victim as well as other shop owners in the neighborhood. He is advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a little change that in order to eradicate organized crime one must find the supreme man. Mason finds the supreme man and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white movie that manages to keep the viewer interested in its various plot twists, although the plot is somewhat confused. It really is the story of a good man who seeks his god, justice and what he is willing to do to achieve it. And it is the most constructed part of all. I suppose there was time before O.J., Menendez Brothers, etc. Etc. When people believed in the integrity of justice and lawyers. For this viewer yet these days are far above. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful, elegant behavior and declamatory voice show us a successful, secure man, but also a deeply caring man. Pidgeon had a magnificent career of 60 years, but never really traveled to superstardom. He was a solid actor who could play almost anything and did. It may be because when he got leaders, he was well into the thirties and missed being a matinee idol; or he could lack it decided something; or that he was written early as a second lead to a great woman star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good performances.
