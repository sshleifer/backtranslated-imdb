Very Small Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (though only on TV) is absolutely outstanding. I was really aware of the differences in appearance or accents so I can't really comment on it. The action in this was so good, I had to squeeze myself and say "Remember, this is just a movie, this is not really happening". As I sat listening to Harris and Quinn talk, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they actually had this meeting. Offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character (especially in the restaurant!), Which was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back. Both actors did and excellent work, and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. It's an evil experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare for some surprises!
