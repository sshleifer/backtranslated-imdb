It is not surprising that author / director Michael Powell considered "A Case of Life and Death", his and Emeric Pressburger's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favorite of their movie together. Released during the aftermath of the Second World War, this colorful romantic adventure would only have given tonics to a traumatized, restorative nation that needs a good lifting. After a number of other patriotic war films, The Archers made this their most disgusting, skitish and most patriotic of the party. Quintessentially British to maintain the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly American in its Baroque compositions, technical ingenuity and a fine multi-ethnic cast. <br /> <br /> Oddly echoing another 1946 classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," opens AMOLAD at a magnificent attachment, with one of the great translations of the sermon on earth and heaven, and what great and wonderful world we live in. <br /> <br /> It then cuts into a British cockpit, hit hard, up in flames and with co-pilot already dead. It sounds misunderstood, but the connection soon becomes clear with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> Nearly 5 minutes of clocking, the fast-paced reflex between the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in his intimacy. Retired to die, Peter nevertheless expands lots of power, charm and exhaustion of confessions, and his warm connection to June closes with a common exchange of 'I Love You'. <br /> <br /> Keep up with the magic of the moment, Peter, under the supervision of his conductor 71, whose task it was to transport him to the "Second World," escaping death and finding himself stranded on a beach. He meets bike later in June and immediately matches the body with his voice. <br /> <br /> But realize their mistakes, the courtesy will have Peter sent back and order the French conductor (Maurice Goring) down to earth to pick him up. But Peter is stubborn to live because of June and the conductor's fault and deliberately guarding his corner. Peter's fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and skilled British delegates. The surrealistic experiment, which dissolves from b / w back to Rich Technicolor when the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final shot at the hospital validates the predictable result. The abstract, frame filling "Stairway to Heaven" (the American title of the movie) is used twice: The first time ib / w as it lifts Peter and his enigmatic French guardian upward, giant statues cross Peter's potential lawyers for trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly colored staircase gives the setting for what is an iconic image in the cinema - Peter and June frozen side by side, their astonished eyes fastened forward in the frame, their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely devotion shared between Peter and June is never weak or sensible; It is treated with nobility and the belief that the couple is already fit enough to be married and simply has to convince people of their love so that it can hold them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze time and people's bodies, matures many of their key moments together, refines Peter's story and among his evil tricks, Peter's Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee cup break . As visually inspired as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, it was the first time the combined color with b / w ?? The latter has a cheerful quality when used for sky scenes, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The excellent script more than corresponds to the imaginative set of designs, with a dialogue that sounds so instantaneous that it doesn't feel it was written or performed for the screen. Entertaining and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves the same acclamation with their forte of color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that challenges that age, looks fresh and inventive, even at this age where CGI would vamp its artificial effects , probably stripping them of their emotional miracle. <br /> <br /> Other crooked changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten the dialogue so that it can maintain the low publicity tensions of most audiences. Powell weaves a spell that unknowingly absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical evolution of Peter's difficulties.
