I saw it when I was a kid and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices how sweet. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as a profester was interesting. Burl Ross as little rabbit Foo Foo was fun. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What's sorry for the Little Bunny Foo Foo, who bends Meecy Mice upside down, so by an adventure will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes, then he becomes goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle goes to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent, kids will like this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
