"Magic" is not too strong a word for spelling this movie weaver. You find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more charitable light ... Any film that has a civilizing effect on viewers deserves serious attention. Rarely are we soaked in beauty like this one. As if that wasn't enough, it's fun. Performances are without extraordinary extraordinary, but in particular, the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the amazing Josie Walker - both open as roses. Why is NOT this movie on DVD? It deserves to live forever.
