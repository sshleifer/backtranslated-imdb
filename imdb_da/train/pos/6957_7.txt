My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more, no less. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet, simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and hooks up with her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems to be ok, but Matt finds out that she is G-Girl. First, it seems really cool to Matt, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up with her and join his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she begins to revenge on her former boyfriend. What I liked most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl turns to Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a different role than her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy.
