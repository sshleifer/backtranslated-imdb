I'm not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 character of one of my childhood favorites. It doesn't wow me that much at 17, but as a family movie it's a sweet and well-meaning movie. Children will surely love it and will not mind the mistakes and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the movie. None of the film was preaching in any way, it actually has a big message that added its sweetness. I will admit that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screwey's death (which still fears me) may be a bit on the frightening side. But the animation is well above average with great colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful and the song highlighted is memorable, captivating and entertaining. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most profound of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and sought after, the part when he tells Screwey's "I quit!" had me in stitch. My favorite is Screweyes, but an effective villain who is clever and I accept intelligently. If anything, I want the movie to be kept in that part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is afraid of crows, for that way he could have been more developed in depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its fun and heart-warming parts, and should keep children and adults entertained. The voice that acted for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith gave all the solid performances, but special mention should go to Kenneth Mars, for he was absolutely fantastic as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, it's a good movie. I don't get the review, honestly I don't. Sure this movie isn't perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's great fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
