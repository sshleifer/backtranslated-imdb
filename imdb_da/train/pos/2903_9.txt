Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy. After his big fist film called El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron made another good work. Tiempo de valientes sees moments a movie made in Hollywood. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors, and here they have amazing performances. The movie is very fun and fun, and it has amazing moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that I totally recommend if you want a good time. And I congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
