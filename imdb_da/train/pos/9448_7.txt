This was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The first part of the film, though weird, has a bright and entertaining quality to it. The journey begins on such a peaceful note that details and emphasizes the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But it is misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the country's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain and I shake at the thought. Lewis legs made me twist. But while the film was very disturbing and disturbing at all, it raised some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take another person's life? What can morals make us do, or not, in some cases? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one can draw from the movie, it is a performance in itself (despite some aspects that were chilling real and cruel).
