Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it fun, cordial and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a child, and sometimes they could go back to the good Ole days, for a short time really need to see this! It starts as 20 years later, a group of old campers returning to a "reunion". I don't want to comment on the plot anymore because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great and it contains an all star cast. Everyone in it played a great role. You actually felt that you were part of the movie that looked at it. Alan Arkin was particularly good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy everyone wants them to have in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this to anyone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
