Ghost Story, (The New House) is a great horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and The Ghost Story series in the early 70's. The beginning and end of each story is told by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as main actors and as the main characters in history. I saw it recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend seeing this. This story is amazing, no gore or curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played his husband. Both actors were very good at their parts. If you like scary, funny, scary ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. I gave this a high rating.I highly recommend this story.
