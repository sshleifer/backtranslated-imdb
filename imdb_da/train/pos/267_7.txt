It all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students at Hickory Road, London. Worried about his sister, who is the housekeeper there, Miss Lemon Hercule Poirot asks to look at the matter. He agrees, but soon the effort becomes higher when a girl who had admitted she was responsible for most (not all) thefts was found murdered. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being so mind-numbingly complicated as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". Murder, theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the last twist that ties everything together is only revealed in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially psychologist Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, inspector Japp has his fun moments (perhaps the closest this series has come to "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon gets a more integrated part to the story than normal.
