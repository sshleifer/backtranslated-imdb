This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. Possibly they are spoken, but there is a chance to change something about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and completely free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still some emphasis on the story that surrounds the family. The story usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious film. <br /> <br /> A young couple - Liyan, a void, and his wife Yuwen live in a once great family relationship that is partially destroyed. <br /> <br /> A bright contrast is Liyy's young sister, who can't really remember the family's past, but accepts everything in a completely natural way. Her spirit is as clear as the other two are reserved. In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... I ended up feeling quite sad - but surely a superior movie.
