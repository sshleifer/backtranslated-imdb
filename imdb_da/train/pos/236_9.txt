It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "Amati Girls" is such a movie. In old time cinemas I would have stayed put at several exhibitions. Was this story autobiographical for the author / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> The star-studded cast presents their characters credibly and with tenderness. Who wouldn't have Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I have loved her work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most movies, you believe faith is because we know it's actors, producers, directors, sound engineers, etc. It was hard to suspend such belief in "The Amati Girls". You feel such a part of this family! How I wanted to defend Dolores, as her family stifles her emotional life. And would like to greet Lee Grant when she criticizes Cloris Leachman's hair color. The mood throughout is not stomach grin, but instead has a sensitive quality that meets much more than talk and so. The love depicted in this cinema family must be emulated and appreciated. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the family, Amati, translated from Italian means "dear ones".
