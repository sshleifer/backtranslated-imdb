I just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, but I thank you very much but there are still questions about me. While it appears that the first 7 episodes, or in fact, are a tale of the events of the first Lodos war history, the truth is that they are not really. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of how the original ended (and that may be the reason why the first 7 episodes occur), but I do not think so. CotHK says it starts 5 years after the War of Heros, which Parn was a part of. I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds, because they look much smaller after the series kicks in in Sparks history. Now, when the series kicks into Sparks part, we find ourselves again 10 years (15 years ago the Heros War). Spark and his crew are in some cases similar to the Parn and his crew when the journey kicks into gear, especially the love story that breaks between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I was throwing in the original series, and if it wasn't for Spark's long blue hair, I know I would have pressed the stop more than once to make sure the right disk was in In no way do I consider these major setbacks, but the authors did a good job of creating credible signs and a remarkable story. The only thing that hurts me is that ashram and wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ??? Don't make me wrong, both are big villains, even if the only bad thing about the ashram is that he supports Marmo. Maybe I missed something during the rough series that explained that part. As far as followers go, however, I highly recommend CotHK. I place both CotHK and even more the original Lodos war history far above the rings' trilogy. Both of these are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.
