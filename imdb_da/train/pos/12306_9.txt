A Chinese Ghost Story stars the late, big Leslie Cheung like Ling Choi Sin, an excellent tax collector who decides to stay in an abandoned temple where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost that has been forced to seduce victims of a vicious tree spirit that gives birth to 'chi' (vitality), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her a proper funeral. Ling with the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a mad Taoist monk, defeats Ling's success with the tree spirit, but must also fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, to whom Tsing is due to be married. <br /> <br /> The first Hong Kong movie that I saw, which was not purely martial arts action, opened a Chinese Ghost Story to my eyes to the amazing world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical world inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bumbling innocent heroes, swords wielding Taoist monks, monstrous spirits, and dark lords of the underworld; I instantly fell in love with the movie's flood, energy, humor, ingenuity and visual expertise. Two decades later, and this amazing movie is still one of the finest examples of its genre I've seen? ? a sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With excellent direction from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing by David Wu, great filmography and a whole lot of imaginative special effects (including a humongous killer tongue, a lot of tentacled monster and several flying heads!), A Chinese Ghost Story is a truly unforgettable and a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.
