Loved the movie. Loved the two families who cross paths in history. The only question is whether Sam is killed, how does his family's line continue? He is Madame Zeroni's son and Zero must be related but no mention of other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned other children or wife before talking to and in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a baby before he became the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the errors in the movie. Just loved it. The action was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir, Marion is a woman at the end, but makes his character even more fun. The other "advisor" seemed worried about the kids, but of course maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinking childhood to be so strange when she grew up.
