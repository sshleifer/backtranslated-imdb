Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra listened to each other as they made this film and in the years following it. Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (already saddened by the fact that he was thrown as Nathan Detroit when he wanted that part of Skye Masterson) would be the star singer in the production and didn't want anyone to be better than he was. He told Brando to get lost, to get back to him, Marlon continued to screw the scene into the diner Sinatra ate cheesecake, so he had to continue eating, eating and eating. In recent years, Sinatra Brando gave the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of the way he talks.
