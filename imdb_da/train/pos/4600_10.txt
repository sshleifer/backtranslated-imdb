It's sad that this movie is the top, at least in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best Action movie ever made. The action films today are poorly executed The actors and action directors do not do anything to make it fight and stumble properly. only some not how to make the most of Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunters are so clever and wild, I don't think we will see anything as ever. The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chases through the hill town is just amazing. The final battles are for me the best fighting stunts ever set for film. The tip of the end slides into the pole, which crashes through the Jackie glass, and was severely wounded.
