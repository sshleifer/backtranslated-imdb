I searched for this after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging "Clueless" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best-known start-up of her movie career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should help improve most movie projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment that I think the movie has for me is an awkward "feeling" to some of the scenes that come from the need to run a rather uncompromising adult theme as part of what begins in tone as a schoolgirl adventure. /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one. She does well the na√Øve enthusiasm and growing turmoil affecting Mary Giordano as she maneuvers against the truth behind the serial killers. I reckon her characterization of MG also has a mileage in it. The story of the story is that she continues to pursue a law enforcement career. It might be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revise Giordano in a time of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in good light. Pat Verducci also has the written credit. I don't know of any other film work done by PV. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. Like most productions, this has a virtually unknown support cast, even though Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is almost not. Over the last decade, he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screens. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), one made for television presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic American television comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers" because the leading player is Judith Light, remembered with love from many because of her long engagement with the show. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" couldn't have worked easily, but OK. I think it's an entertaining story worth seeing.
