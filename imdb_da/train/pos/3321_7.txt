I saw "fever pitch" kind of accidentally; It played on the plane that went over to Europe. In fact, it wasn't half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's # 1 Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can push it. The film is a relatively interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. It is especially eye opening now that the Red Sox has ended losing their 80-odd years. I guess these kinds of things are happening all the time and we don't tend to notice them. Not so bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that shows an unusual relationship with baseball is 2000's "Frequency". Check them out both.
