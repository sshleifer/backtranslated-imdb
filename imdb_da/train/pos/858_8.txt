This movie has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to "keep it to MAN". "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, who Carla reports to her office. Later, Paul is guilty of 70 to Mr. Marchand Club owns. And then there's Paul's Parole Officer. There seems to be so much question about this last character's side story. Reviewers point to it as a weakness in an otherwise well-designed underground game ping-pong between our two main characters, escalating tit-tatat until their lives change dramatically. They are seen for each agent by "MAN". One or both can be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of relief at the end. Carla is finally laid. Her boss is forced to be a dunk. Mr. Club Owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. They get the $ money $. And ... they don't have to worry about reporting to the Parole Officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement (or what the police found to arrest him). It is a critically unconscious trigger for the locking mechanism that sows us so closely. Don't let anyone else get Paul's file later to monitor his release; for the moment they are available! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They're putting it to MAN!
