I thought the movie was pretty well done for one made for TV movies, and it contained a lot of action and humor. I found the entertainment value worth seeing and would see it again or a similar show again. I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I can see an opportunity for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with Sean to play for even higher "cash" stakes, since his life would be on the line again anyway. I felt that Sean played the role very well and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of our lives - Soap Opera.
