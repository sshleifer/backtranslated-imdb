A really sweet heroine who is surprised and frightened by the giblets, wrestles with mattresses, runs completely in closed doors ... just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of 'The Naked Truth'. I LOVED what I caught from this show: Enjoyed sudden plots and some good supporting characters gave the setting for the fair diamond - Tea Leoni as, 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clown and wonderfully unfortunate - how refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder Hollyood doesn't know how to throw her. But where-oh-where are the DVD releases? The amount of (bleep) they release is amazing to me that this little gem remains buried. (Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.)
