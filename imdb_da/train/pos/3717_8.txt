It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful mood and yet never bend to be mushy. There is some fantastic filmography, and the main girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. It has a real heart to it. It is the Achilles wounds of childhood that are exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I am looking for one for his next project. The follow-up is always the most difficuous thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope his next movie is not like a shark movie. Cheers to everyone. Enjoy your movie theater.
