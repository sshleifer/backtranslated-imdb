The young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an elderly man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he cannot satisfy her sexually and ignore her. Frustrated she goes home and plans to become a divorce. So one day she is shining dipping in a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after it! She meets young and very beautiful Adam (Aribert Mog). They love and she realizes that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER !!!! Of course, since this was made in 1933, she must be punished for her sin so that it leads to a tragic final. END OF CLOSING SPOILS !!!! <br /> <br /> This awful people in 1933, but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamar's naked swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse completely naked, it appears either in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such. There are only a few minor shots of his breasts. Also, when she has sex with Mog, nothing appears, but her face, but you see her achieving an orgasm. These scenes were considered quite extreme in their day and were completely carved by the American release. Now they are back in. This movie would move on with a PG-13 easily now. <br /> <br /> Bumpers aside are just OK. It is beautifully busy and there is almost no dialogue. Apart from music scores, this can be a silent picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog in particular, and they are so attractive that they just breathe away and see them. Also, the order in which they love is easily one of the most beautiful shot and acted sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there are a few of them) are unfortunately quite obvious today. I actually started giggling over one! <br /> <br /> Really beautiful, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, good acting around - but I wasn't exactly bent over it. I found the movie slow (beautiful imagery doesn't make a picture for me), something boring, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the end but it does not apologize for the other issues I had with it. Also the final sequence is really strange - and out of place. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it, but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so I'm in the minority. Use your own rating.
