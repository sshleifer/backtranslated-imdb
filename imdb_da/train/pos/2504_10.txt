When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The stunters are much like the Matrix moving like moving too fast to balls, some sort of thing and jumping around very far. Another reason why I film is good is because the sweet anime faces them during the movie. The way Gackt makes his pouting faces or just the way they act, VERY ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fans, you should see it.
