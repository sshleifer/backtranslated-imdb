<br /> <br /> I suppose this is not the best movie ever made, but I voted it on 10 stars all the same. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. Me and all the people around me were just touched. It's something you often don't feel. We all become a bit cynical and concerned about sentimentality, lazy manipulation or the sermon of modern film. The story of the film centers around Jane a young woman in the last stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the brink of a collapse. This could easily have been a dull and dignified piece, but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you completely and against the odds is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The action from Branagh and Bonham-Carter is amazing, especially the last one that is always credible and strong in its role. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richard's masterpiece, a plane made by junk and his old paintings. Flight here is a symbol of both Richards and Janes who live life to the full, so one can go on and the other can come to an end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and fun movie that I would recommend to anyone. Don't let the topic get rid of you.
