It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple but good daughter to Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in his last role, shows what a fine actor he was. It's hard to believe this is a David Lynch movie. It is slow and smooth, sweet and moving. One of the best, unless you like car racing, sex scenes and violence.
