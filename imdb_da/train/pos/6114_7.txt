A really cute movie that has some similarities to the 2001 hit "My Sassy Girl" but is able to enchant most of the time. The greatest applause should go to the two leaders. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and quirky, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG stakes to peer up the visuals and also offers impressive combat scenes where Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked him much better here than in the heavily overvalued "Volcano High". And that boy has a future - they look, these fighting techniques and a romantic leadership. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can do it briefly: Nice movie. My rating: 7/10
