In general, I find Loretta Young difficult to take, too worried about her appearance and too bad in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she plays a low self-esteem patsy that puts up too much bullying from the parameters of Spencer Tracy, she is direct and honest and irresistible. It is a strange little movie played mostly in a one-room cabin in a Hooverville, exceptionally upfront about the depression, yet romantic and idealized. Tracy, who plays a scruffy, hard-to-take "regular guy" who would be a horrible chauvinist and bullied by today's standards, softens the hard edge of his characters and makes him almost appealing. There is good support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never came as far as she should), and Jo Swerling's manuscript is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up and Young. You want to slap her and tell her character to be clever, she is too good at this guy, but she is so deep and convincing, you are pleased to see that their story is a satisfactory conclusion.
