Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation shows again and again how to make animation correct. <br /> <br /> Seeing the first episode of Creature Comforts was fun. I thought it translated well for American audiences. My only concern is that most of the audience will not get the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Having been a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew what I was up to when I sat down to see this. The animators did a great job, matching pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal. Look at the first episode of the goat that sounds rocky and the dogs on the street still call each other "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show for an entire season. But as I said before, the audience won't get it.
