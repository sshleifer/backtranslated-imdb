The story is extremely unique. It's about these 2 pilots who save the earth from alien creatures, but they need a special speed that makes everything around them age fast. The whole series is about pilots dealing with loss of time, friends and mentors. The end could have been fantastic. It started to end up with a total notation and left a genuine brand, but instead ended up with a super happy Disney note and annoyed me very badly. <br /> <animation is decent at 89, but cannot be compared to today. I also heard many complaints about the nudity cheesiness.I actually found it to be somewhat decent. The necessity mostly was justified except in episode 2 where there was a profit. Everything it deserves a look, but the end keeps it from being a classic.
