There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows it. Frank Franklin, who is the second half of the writing team of detective stories, does not know. He kills his partner Jim Ferris, who was planning to go solo. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks all sorts of questions from Mr Franklin. And returning to another question. Columbo: The Book of Murder (1971) is governed by young Steven Spielberg before his fame days. Stephen Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with its shabby look. It is hard to believe that this man could solve any crime. But he could. Each one of them! Peter Falk is the only one in the world who could portray this character. So no remakes, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife Joanna Ferris.There is some endearing in the scenes between Columbo and her. How does he make the omelet and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. She actually met a tragic fate when she died after a murder she is doing here. I've been a fan of Columbo since childhood and I still enjoy seeing them. There was a break for many years that they didn't show Columbo stories at all, but now he's back. Back to another question.
