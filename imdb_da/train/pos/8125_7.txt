Things to come are the rarity of rarity, a film about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few attempts to show us how this future came about. The first part of the movie, when the war comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, movie members in the release year laughed at reports that enemy aircraft attacked England - sensation was at its height. Wells prediction was widespread too early.) Mounting of endless war that follows while marred by sub-model work is most effective. The explanatory titles resemble German expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his set of ruins in Everytown is among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the boss's mistress. Everytown of the 21st Century is an equally striking design. The story of the history of the 21st century is not convincing - perhaps this was a misguided attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with barbarism in 1970. Unfortunately, the model work that represents angry crowds is dropping elevated walkways, ridiculously bad and could Have been done much better, even with the 30s of technology. This is particularly madman, as the scenes in the giant plane are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massy's magnificent speech that concludes the movie - rarely has the idea of ​​scientific progress been expressed as well. Massey's last question is more relevant now than ever, at a time of hard-cut manned spaceflight. The scene is aided by Sir Arthur Bliss's appalling music whose surname I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are horrible, with serious technical issues. Most versions have edited a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that take us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD from the whole movie.
