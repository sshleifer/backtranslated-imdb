Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie starring some of the best of the era. It is located in a hospital's maternity ward, especially in the place of women who are expected to have problems. In it is an elderly woman, a fierce rude mother (Glenda Farrell), a weak young woman, an Italian woman and the protagonist (Loretta Young) who spend 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second, who hurts to know that everything will be okay. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great for her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and entertaining. It is not particularly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected topic on the silver screen. The action is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is beautiful here in her prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as it can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is fantastic as always, a staple for precodes and for good reason.
