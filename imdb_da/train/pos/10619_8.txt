Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me" fame) and her two assistants Karen (the appealing spunky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the beautiful Lois Young who are not only killed first but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty free naked bath scene) go to Solvang, California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels have been booked solidly, the three lovely ladies are forced to look for space and board a swimming, but vanishing remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller (deliciously played for geeky perfection of late, big Sydney Lassick) and his bad sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a very unpleasant and deadly dark family secretly resident in his sledge basin: a portrait, pathetic, blurry, incest-spawned master mongoloid named Junior (an alternate touching and scary depiction of Stephen Furst; Flounder in " Animal House "), which of course is solved and spreads some murderous chaos. Heavily directed by Danny Steinmann, with consistent effect from a robust cast, a compelling pervert plot, an excellent make-up by Craig Reardon, a nicely spooky atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow but steady pace, sympathetic generous characters, and a surprising heartbreaking final freezing plate (incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and exciting blow), this unwarranted overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is worth checking out.
