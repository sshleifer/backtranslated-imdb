In your video store you may find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human state of modern times LA. Not excessive drama, just a collapse of events that can happen to a group of individuals over time. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joy and desperation of city life. <br /> <br /> The direction and cutting are first class. Cinematography and music follow the mood and situation very much. And the CASTEN !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent acting. Nobody out of place or out of character. <br /> <br /> And it's NOT as much a downer as you would expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, do it!
