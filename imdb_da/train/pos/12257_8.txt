This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow (though I liked the one too). It is not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the manuscript is better. Davies is a champion to adapt Austen to film, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not quite as shiny as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and costumes actually worked better.
