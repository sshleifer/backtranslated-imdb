Suddenly Impact is the best of the five Dirty Harry movies. They come nothing slimmer and more transparent than this that Harry needs through a series of violent clashes, with the evil guys getting their only desserts. It's just the way I like it. Great story too and very directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
