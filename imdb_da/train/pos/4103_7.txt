The main characters of this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a fun, drowsy guy who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation is out of control. Though Standa is genuine (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy Ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bows everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa can have a chance to go through life with some modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it will certainly not be without much headache! Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius type, which degenerates into some Hitler-esquire wild colors. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of the Czech film. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech movies I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.
