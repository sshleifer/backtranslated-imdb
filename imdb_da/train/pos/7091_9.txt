The big problem is where to start, as this movie needs your attention in the next two hours, and don't miss a few minutes to get a coke, as there is a danger you can't follow. But well, there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis will enter an hourly machine to find out some antivirus for a virus that caused animals to reign throughout the world in 1996. Thanks to some errors, he will first end in 1990, then in World War I and where disturbed it The whole could look like Terry Gilliam comes up with what should be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF stories should be told like, and his choice of cast could not have been better, that's the lunatic Brad Pitt (his asylum performance is memorable) and a fantastic Bruce Willis who proves that he is more than some Schwarzenegger will be. It's a movie you can see over and over again, as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that all views give you other surprises. One of my great favorites.
