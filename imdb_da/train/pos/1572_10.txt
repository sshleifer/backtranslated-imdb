When I read a review from another user, I say it's a terrible game, I couldn't stand idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Now this game is great, from the news clips (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), to the story I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies start blinking when they die until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the LEILA VR missions when you ride here and there ... <br /> Apart from that, it's a great game with a great story, great graphics, great characters, great soundtracks .. I recommend it! Safe! It can be a little old but still fun! At least on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version should be the same.
