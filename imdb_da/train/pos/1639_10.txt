Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, sharp reality. I will not elaborate on all the other reviewers' comments because you get the picture! But the movie is not too squeamish. The reality is slaughtered pigs and other livestock to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's homestead book. I read it several years ago, I have to re-read it as I just looked at the newly released remastered DVD in the movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought it from a video store that went out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's worth it to me. This is a movie I will watch until my days are over!
