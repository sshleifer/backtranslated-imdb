Outstanding film from 1943 with Paul Lukas, giving an Oscar-calibrated priest as the head of his family, bringing them back to America from Europe when the Nazis threatened. The usual amazing Bette Davis maintains his reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any movie from 1943. <br /> <br /> Talking about treason around them, Luke successfully addresses the situation. He knows he must return to Europe on a secret mission and return. <br /> <br /> Davis is once again pulling all the stops with a Katharine Hepburn-like outpouring of tears when sharing. Resolute, she knows that her older son should follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie that highlights American positive propaganda against an evil enemy.
