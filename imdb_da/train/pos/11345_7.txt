That's why I still have nightmares. This scary movie (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy leaves a magical journey to an island. The mayor, Pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon that looks more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me, and a magically speaking flute is targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered "a little okay" at that time). <br /> <br /> The whistle is recovered by an "interesting" witch convention where the witches have a homosexual age. The boy walks in succession then as a 'fe' to regain the whistle. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
