One must admit that Dev has an eye on beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also the former winner of the beauty partner's title, by throwing her in a role tailored to her debut. Her apprehensive, stony appearance and her swaying at the mesmerizing music made her an instant treasure of viewers. This film is an eye-opening experience, with its scenic sites, ethnic peoples, Buddha temples and chirpy, naughty Mumtaz, who look quite attractive in their ethnic wear and dance sciences. Of course, Dev is sweet, and it's one of his commercially successful achievements. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest in the carefully written script, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his second film, Anand, has dealt with the subject of youth who fall into the habit of drug abuse and the theory of those who come from disturbed families and troubled childhood is quite plausible. A good entertainer, this movie retains its freshness to date!
