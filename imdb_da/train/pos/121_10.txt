Critics must review what they classify as a quality film. I think the critics have seen too many acts of film and have bowed to the film's matrix style. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that a show is not enough to understand or appreciate this excellent movie. Lars von Trier shows that old film types can produce wonderful cinema and build drama and excitement. The rear projection effect he uses during the movie awakens and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they have. Other effects that he uses as color and black and white in a scene, just as Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat address the attention and reinforce the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is amazing and has a hypnotic effect, again keeping focus on the key characters of the scene and there actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the effects more, but I think you all agree that they are pushing this movie into their own category and really raising the drama in the movie. A movie to buy if you don't own one and one to see if you don't. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir movie from one of the big movie directors.
