There are other reviews here, so I don't have to say how big it is or what it is about ... My point is: I heard about this movie time ago before it was shown. I can't even remember HOW, I just know it was through the internet. Distributors went down before it ever hit! For months I moped and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to purchase this movie and the only highlighted area is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use the Alta Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know it is PAL format and they changed the text on the screen to German and there is a little bit of story in the beginning that has also been dubbed in German but as fun and campy as this movie is, it really does only fun! If you want to watch this movie and you have a place nearby that makes conversions, then it's worth it! It cost about $ 20 or so to get to the US from Germany. Trust me, it may seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you are in corny b-flicks, you blow money left and right to get conversions to your friends!
