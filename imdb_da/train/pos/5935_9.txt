After seeing the horrible, horrible, horrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see this as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Press play to watch the trailer, I thought I was in for another hidden map from what looked like another bad wannabe filmmaker trying to bring new depth to an existing character. But was instead met with a largely trailer for a movie that unfortunately did not exist, which I would LOVE to watch a finished movie, even though it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST is for BATMAN: DEAD END and saw some. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next short!
