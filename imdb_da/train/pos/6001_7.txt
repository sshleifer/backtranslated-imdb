In no way is a masterpiece, and far from Errol Flynn's best, Istanbul is still on its way to it. The location and the beautiful technicolor cinematography bring us back to some time ago since earlier. Errol Flynn shows moments of his former glory, and it's OK as Jim Brennan, a pilot who is past, comes back to haunt him. The picture is actually a remake of the 1947 "Singapore", and the story seems terribly crafted and clich√© according to today's standards. Also, many of the supporting casts seem to be simply "going through the movements" in this image. Many people have also compared it to one of the all-time greats, CASABLANCA. While I watched the movie, I could see many of the similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take it for what it is worth. Finally, if you are a fan of Flynn, or old-fashioned love stories, you might want to give this movie a look. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of Hollywood's classics.
