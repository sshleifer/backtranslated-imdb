It is very much fun. You know, like a comedy should be. It also looks very good like a Hollywood Spectacular shell. So what more do you want? Howz about a very good Sally Fields. She's so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her in, and she looks so good. This movie is all you need to understand why she is a star. Those eyes! Like a quiet movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. We would do it where you look really fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They do not do it at all in soap washing. Great. The eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many amazing performances, it's fun, just waiting for each one to come back. There is a whole workshop with Kevin Kline about how to handle very very subtly. Understood? Yes, he's the hell good. It is also Robert Downey, Jr. who has since made a career in playing Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and quirky, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives here a little flat delivery a little Zing. OK, no, Whoopi Bashing, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then there is the hair. Soap Dish was made at the end of BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous boxes are like a great character in itself. They grow bigger and sillies like yours have done. Yes, we have pictures. Soap dish is better than I thought it would be, better that I wanted it. I am sick of movies that tell me that I should like low, self-centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV soap actors. Soap dish seems happy just to make me laugh at them. Thank you.
