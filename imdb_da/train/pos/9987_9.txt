I was very moved by the story, and because I go through something that looks like my own parents, I really have connection. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body fails once was alive and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and must live with. I loved Ellen Burstyn's performance and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done. Overall, the look of the movie was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, he humanizes a man who is sprouting down. I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hang us in, but not enough to mash.
