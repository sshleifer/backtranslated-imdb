This movie is plain fun. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to see. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than Band camp and the Naked mile, at least more fun. <right after the first five minutes I was laughing my ass out so I decided to call my friend and we would see it together. We had a few beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You won't find any deep message in this movie, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> So sit back and just enjoy.
