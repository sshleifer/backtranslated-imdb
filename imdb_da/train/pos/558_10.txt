Classic drama / action western with incredible filmography that lies far ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love. Unique look into the American Northwest pioneers is very educational and entertaining. This film is very much in character because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawmakers" during this time and place were very crooked / corrupt like most developing countries today. The action sequences could have been more realistic, yet this film really covers most of the essentials. Not for an audience who only wants pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
