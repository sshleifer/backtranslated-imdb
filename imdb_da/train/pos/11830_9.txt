This is great looking movie with it all done in only six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned the audience with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. These colors, for me at least, make this a fascinating movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I want, freeze and somehow convert them into a painting to study for their art. The characters and history do not match the magnitude of the photography, but they are over-the-top, especially the bad guys. The famous actors who played them here must have had a lot of fun on the "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart and she is as sweet and soft as she is called. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo, who the criminal young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too many to list here. See the full credits on the main page and you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I found were Pacin's voice, laughing at you after a while, Madonna's off-key voice and the fact that the movie would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. These "bugs" are all smaller because it's all a fun movie .... a comic strip that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ..... like nothing you've ever seen.
