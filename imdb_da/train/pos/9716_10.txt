To like this movie you need to be a) in love (without marriage) b) recognize English humor about admiring bile and witty life situations and not just driving gags c) being pretty intelligent because the authors gave the opportunity to laugh and cry over every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the author's input. d) To fully enjoy the movie, you must love women as Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) Admire creative, slightly melancholy people with large and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you will probably consider this movie close to 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never feel like half (!) As much as seeing this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry while I laughed for a few moments (I always become sensitive when good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
