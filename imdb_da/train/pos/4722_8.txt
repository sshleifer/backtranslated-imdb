Given the low budget and production constraints, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic and shows how Csikos (Hungarian riders living on the plains) risked their lives to save a downward US pilot from the ruthless and wild Nazis. We are drawn into strong feelings for the young, yet very brave boy - who admires the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman heroes and magic endings - this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it has been like to dodge persistent amorist Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be thrilled by this movie. I really enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who strive for the end, this movie will be one that you will remember for a long time.
