It's been a while since I've seen this movie and the series, but now I'm renewing my memory! This was a very fun movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun together. Stay and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse drive Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg strengthens the dukes out of their yard, Bo and Luke sneaks around Hoggs local construction site and finds samples of coal. They soon realize that boss Hogg is going to strip my Hazzard County unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie were that Burt Reynolds was not right for Boss Hoggs, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Apart from that, I highly recommend DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
