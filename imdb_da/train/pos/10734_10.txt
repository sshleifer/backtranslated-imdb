WOW! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best living testament I think about what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to something shown by the big media. <br /> <br /> The Outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. This movie shows you what happened on INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It begins focusing on a newcomer New York firefighter waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight for. The subject comes abrupt with the only existing football in the first plan to get hold of the towers. You then get a front seat when firefighters rush to the stage, into the lobby of Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes ahead of the second plane's collapse and the Tower Twos subsequent fall, you see firefighters react to the disturbing sound of people landing across the lobby. It's a sight you won't soon forget. <br /> <br /> Undoing, tearing and very convincing from the first minute to the end, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
