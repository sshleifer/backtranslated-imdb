Leave it to Braik for a good show. Finally, he and Zorak live their own lives outside the Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love both these shows a lot. They are quite what began adult swimming. Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000. It couldn't have been platinum, but his show was really popular for many people out there who love Adult Swim's shows. I have to say that out of all the adult swimming shows without plot, this must be the one with the most no plot ever made. That's why I like it so much, it's just such a classic in adult swimming history. I think it's just such a good show if you don't like it. Hi there were tons that hated it and tons that loved it.
