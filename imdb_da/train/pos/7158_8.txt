Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnat's IV is mistaken for stealing, he is sent to Camp Green Lake. At this camp, Warden and her two orders, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski, the camps digging holes for the hole after hole. But for what reason? Stanley is planning to find out. <br /> <br /> I've never had any sense to see 'Holes' and I have to admit I saw movies really, because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of him, then it doesn't matter. 'Holes' is one of the Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is wonderfully written and contains a wonderful idea of ​​including flashbacks to the past. These are not distracting and really give a great back story. All casts are great. The young stars work well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that although 17, he can act without error. This is a Disney movie you will definitely enjoy as a family. "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
