I must admit that I didn't expect anything good at all at first. I was just expecting a cheesy movie that promotes Gackt's and Hye's image, but I'm happy to say it has much more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the play is not that big, but it doesn't suck either, all are well disciplined, and they bring enough strength to their characters. Effects lack consistency, but action scenarios are satisfactory enough. What really hung me up was the core of the storylin, although it merges amazing elements, it also shows a raw reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really came to me, and I think it's the key to this movie. It makes you think and it makes it good to transfer all the fear. <br /> <br /> It meets all expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
