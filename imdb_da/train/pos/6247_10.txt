Trailers of this movie can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract the audience. Of course, they show the film's main message: <br /> <br /> People who constantly throw their heads in their jobs and live use power that they might have elsewhere to reassure others. And at the lower end of the suppression chain, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A movie that shows this as brutally as the Dog Stage is probably hard to look at, but having to endure such lives is even harder. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is much like Short Cuts, but consists of documentary style episodes that show people like your neighbor playing just as they are. Without glitter, and most disturbing, without hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize that such people are out there and there are many of them, even though our society focuses on the fine exterior appearance. Somewhere the porn industry needs to do its business, somewhere unjustified domestic violence must take place, somewhere hope should crush. I probably know such people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without fun scenes (some might think that disabled women repeat the top ten supermarkets are fun, but it happens for real) and without any melodramatic, watch this movie. But it will lose when you focus on subtitles I fear, since subtitles cannot highlight accentuation.
