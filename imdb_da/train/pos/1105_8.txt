Manhattan homes must cope with all the disadvantages. The worst thing is the lack of closet space! Some people eating all the time use their intervals and dishwashers as storage places because the wardrobes are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writer from that era, saw the potential of Eric Hodgin's novel, whose hero Jim Blandings cannot stand in the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel and two daughters will share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, and Madison Ave. executive, have had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut alive, he decides to take a look. Of course, a first-time owner, Jim, is sentenced by the landlord to buy the overdue house he is taken to inspect by a conscientious agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever might be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to come out with a plan that does not work for the new house after the original is off. Since a problem leads to another, more money is needed and what is going to be the original price ends with an inflated price that Jim could not really afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because of three main characters in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he played and made the most of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a lovely actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old girlfriend of Myrna, became a lawyer for Blandings, suave and debonair, which Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of Blandings Girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who carries an eerie resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The big Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but don't have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look much better. The direction of H.C. Pots are light and he succeeded in this movie, which will delight fans of classic comedies.
