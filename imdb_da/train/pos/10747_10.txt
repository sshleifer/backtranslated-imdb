Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters. What they got was the only movie recording inside the World Trade Center on September 11th. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's ladder company before, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while Gédon stayed at the firehouse in case something interesting happened. A plane flying low over the city distracted Jules, and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film. He stayed on site for the next several hours, filmed reactions from the firefighters and others who were there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers took great care in making the movie too violent, grizzly and gory. But the language of the firefighters is a little rough, and CBS showed a lot of balls that closed it uncensored. The brothers Naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and feelings during special moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a similar title film, most money goes from DVD sales to 9/11 related charities. Very well made, emotionally, moving and without political propaganda, is the best documentary for that kind of date.
