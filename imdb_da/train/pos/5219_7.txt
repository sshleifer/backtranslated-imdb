Gere and Danes act as 2 workers for the Public Security Department, who is watching for released sex offenders. Doctors playing Babbage refer to them as their flock. Gere is an over-obsessed vigilante who is out. He trains, newcomer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. He questions those who are not on the list and tries to act like police and solve crimes. He continues to be warned of this behavior, and thus the reason he is replaced. During his last few days at work, a young girl is missing and Babbage is confident that it is one of his flock that has gone astray. He and Allison narrow down a list and discover some of the offenders have gone AWOL. So he decides to track down the missing girl instead of helping the police. That part is a bit far fetched. <br /> <br /> There are some sick, twisted things shown in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building, a lot of sick people interfere with each other. There are also the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film we see what are sick freaks. However, I wouldn't call this movie too big because there isn't much on film. FINALLY VALUE: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and the police chasing murderers then you will like this.
