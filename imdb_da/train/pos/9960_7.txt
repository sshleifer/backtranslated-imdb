I noticed that this movie was thrown well before the hit theaters, and I didn't have much hope for it either. I figured it was another "You Got Served" type movie with some great dance movements and horror acting. I was at the theater and decided between this and met the Spartans and picked this. To my surprise, the play was not bad at all, and the film was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the waste posted here, I recommend you see a matinee view of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone has been to it. When it comes to dancing movies, this is certainly one of the better ones with far better plays than many of the others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD, and more people check out the movie instead of judging it from comments before the movie is released. <br /> <br /> edit The movie now moves closer to the correct rating. Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9, a little too high, but at least it helps offset the ridiculous voices of 1.
