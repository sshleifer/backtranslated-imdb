The movie starts with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells and waiting for their inevitable meeting with the death represented by the electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then our "hero" called Tenshu is taken to the chair, he is zapped and so .... he's still "Alive". AHA! He gets a choice of some spooky military guys who look really cool: We either sip before we have made sure you are actually dead OR you can go through this door and take the fate that lies ahead of you. "Our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in another kind of cell (very high tech and very large) where he finds another cellmate who also succeeded To survive the electric boogie ride A voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do what they want as long as it happens within that space, which sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept: What can they do otherwise do? <br /> <br /> What these two men do not know is that they have been put together so that they can awaken an inner urge to kill in them. Basically, the unknown scientists in the background go out of them until they decide they should kill each other. Sounds weird? Actually, but there is a greater purpose for all of this. This is the part that sh You must not be revealed and then it must remain untouched. <br /> <br /> But don't fear, it's the unknown that entices the viewer to see more of this pseudo-action movie because it has a completely different approach to the question: How long can you stand by being with a man who is a SOB and would you kill him for freedom? The first hour basically tries to awaken your interest, it sneaks up, without actually knowing it. Then it becomes a rollercoaster with WILD Matrix-like action battle sequences with a touch of individuality to honor the cartoon on which the movie is based. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually very special, so especially that normal cinemas will not see it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is amazing, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie unique. <br /> <br /> If you were lucky enough that your cinema or video store has it, watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies earn big bunches of money. <br /> <br />
