When our local TV station was first launched, it followed much of its schedule with the old British programming. "Unlock your daughters!" was properly aired and I swayed at the opening few seconds of the movie - appeared in a shiny tape. Best thing I've ever done. The actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to a wonderful life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you in stitches, like Hoyden and her family). Double entangles are abundant, plot-line wheels in the wheels blend and match the characters, hilarious sight gags in each scene, and risqu√© comments are made regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the movie to friends a couple of years ago and they called the play "a lost treasure" just as much to the cast as to the story. To this day, I can break up just thinking about the dialogue. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release, I'll be at the front of the line.
