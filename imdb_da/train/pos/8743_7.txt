A good movie with strong performances (especially the two leaders). The film is about two American girls caught with 6 kilos of heroin at an airport in Thailand. They are both thrown into prison and one of them signs a decree. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer trying to get them out. All they have to do is find a Nick Parks that put drugs in the bag of one of the two girls. So far for the story, which is not the original one (it has many similarities with the better return to paradise). The actress and Newton Thomas Sigel's beautiful photography make this movie worth seeing. A 7 out of 10.
