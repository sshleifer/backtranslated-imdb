It is not surprising that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but I totally enjoyed it. The first 5 minutes are the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a Spiderman attitude, Busey shouts the best worst line of any movie ever created ... "your worst nightmare butthorn!" I coughed some of my eggs enough to laugh so hard. This line resonates so well, it even harbors Clooney's infamous "hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments are that Busey is constantly upset that people remind him that he killed his former CIA partner ... which he accidentally shot him in the chest (all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes it possible to see paint dry seem exciting). There is an ashtray for the nads, blows on the face and a "it was not my fault and you know it!" Now the footage shows him that he lacks the bad guy and beats his friend, so ... Second scream must be that his former girl turns a grenade down to the ground to allow his escape - a plan that tolerates all logic , physics and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of Thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and begins to run and prevents a small object, I almost reached me. Some of Busey's best work far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" My voice is a perfect 10 (in poo meters that is).
