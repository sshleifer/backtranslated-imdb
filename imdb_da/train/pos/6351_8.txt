When Grinch came out, I was thrilled even though I thought it would be a happy, lucky movie and it was. Even though it had a little nightmare before Christmas touched it. You know kind of dark and creepy. I loved this movie because it helped fill people with Christmas. So Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened so well in Whoville, they say that Grinch's little heart grew three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
