I was brought up at Doc Savage and was petrified by the green death as a child, but even then as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining. I've made countless friends and colleagues on this movie and have been most entertained by the variety of reactions given to most people I think are weird, but there you are. "I don't know what it's about Doc, but he always gets the girls" must be the ultimate line when looking at his sad band of men. This movie is a classic spoof on the whole superhero genre, and was way before it's time it shouldn't be taken seriously, moving over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be restored and bastardized as I said it is a classic, it can't be done without Ron. (Like the Italian job without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
