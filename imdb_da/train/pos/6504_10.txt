My wife and I have seen this whole series at least three times. I can't imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" World War II story? No library could keep such a story ?? But that is the best summary of that story. Lots of details, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view. <br /> <br /> Olivier's story is well written and of course excellent. Interviews are from all sides, except the Russians, because the producers were not allowed to speak to many Russians. It is very worth owning this complete program on DVD. We treasure our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer does an excellent job of delivering images and actions where there is virtually nothing in an archive: Almost no film of convoys and submarines, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.
