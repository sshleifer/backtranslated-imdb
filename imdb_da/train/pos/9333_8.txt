Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same town that Marlene Moore grew up, I have heard stories from her from my parents, grandparents, and family members. So when I found out that they wanted to film a movie about her and that the beginning would be shot on my street and her house close to mine, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, you get the very different picture of her as a person, she was considered uncomfortably beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her except for her own family, who often abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school, you would find that she was really hurt before she even set foot in an institution she was always defensive and what seems like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassing the fact that she couldn't. <br /> <br /> Marlene didn't deserve the life she was given with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and the people around her who helped further in her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I am still angry that she was imprisoned for self-defense by a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They didn't know what to do with her, so they locked her away and it killed her." I believe in it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.
