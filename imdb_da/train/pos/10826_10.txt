I have rarely come from watching a movie with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I was out with really good friends and had a wonderful time! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action was amazing, though I should mention Bill Nye especially as giving a completely flawless performance. Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in several movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to watch them as they provide such good performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, absolutely fantastic. It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned. Such a refreshing experience to see a well-written, beautifully recorded and beautiful film.
