I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of the recordings in both are identical, but here's where they differ: In one version (the version I've seen most often on broadcast TV), the group of churchmen guarding the gate consists of the "Protector's Brotherhood", one ( fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the Church. In the second version, which I have only seen once on television, the performance that protects the gateway is depicted as priests in the official church, meaning that the architect in New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also in the previous edition, in most of the relevant scenes, the churches are called "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father, then and then, but the sounded saying says "Brother" in the last version I think everybody is referred to as "father". <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partially resumed of the other, with all "actors Brotherhood "scenes resumed as" Archdiocese "scenes, or vice versa. (Mind reminds me of Raymond Burr scenes in" Godzilla "). I have video recorded both versions of TV shows, so no, I can't imagine. shed some light on the story behind these two versions of the movie?
