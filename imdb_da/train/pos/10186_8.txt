Okay, I know, it doesn't make India a good light. But the overall theme of the movie is not India, it's Shakti. The power of war domination and a man's power. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son turns you off in their heat. Then it goes wrong wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and life is changed by it is the strength of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to Karisma Kapoor's credible desperation. It's easy to get caught in love, violence, and redemption of life in this movie, and find yourself with a sigh of relief and sadness by climax. The musical interludes are strengths, credible and well-finished.
