Tom Hanks has been in such popular movies as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles have been good guys, for which we rejoice. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis is slightly different. In Sam Mendes' film Road to Perdition based on Max Allan Collin's graphic novel, he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hitman who is now being chased by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig). After a job in the wrong way due to Connor, the only witness to his fault is Sullivan and his son who should not be there. So Connor is trying to take out Sullivan and his family, but only gets wife and other son Peter. Sullivan smiles and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With her wife and child death, Sullivan takes the roads to find answers. The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and child, and for Michael, who feels like he's blamed for all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a fantastic job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a feeling of being dangerous. His innocence is well done when he travels from city to city, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> Mendes' former hit film was American Beauty, who received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This film did not nearly as well on the Oscar and won only a best film award but received five other nominations for music, sound and a best actor in a role role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story that takes you on a trip through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: man, hitman and devoted father. This movie is a sleeping movie to be seen in the coming years.
