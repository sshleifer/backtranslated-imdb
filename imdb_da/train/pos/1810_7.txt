I can understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't. For me, I really like it, even though I saw some good bits and not so impressive bits. The animation was actually excellent as Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best was Anne-Marie, who was pronounced by the late Judith Barsi. (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her). Carface is also a very convincing villain, especially pronounced by the wonderful Vic Tayback (I especially loved "Moron's I am surrounded by Morons") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy were missing just the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the film is very joking, just as Annabelle's "You can never come come back", which kind of scares me still. Unfortunately, there were some things I did not like so much. The story tended to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that small children would find disturbing, but the ending is very exciting. But the biggest mistake was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. None of them stand out, except for "Let's make music together" and "Love survive", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has made much better song. All in all, a watchable movie, it could have been more, but it is certainly memorable and I would definitely see it again. 10.7. Bethany Cox
