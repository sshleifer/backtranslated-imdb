Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino is becoming a great achievement as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, becomes a strong player in the drug world as he tirelessly runs his self-proclaimed kingdom crime in Florida. This gangster flick is hard, violent, tall, gross, uncomfortable and must keep the record to express the word "f - k" the most number of times. Almost three hours long and yes it can be repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat, cheering for the decline of a ruthless crime master. <br /> <br /> Playing interesting characters is also Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham, and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring the reality to his character, leaving a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone because you leave believing you went away from a disaster. Is it so strong enough for you? Crime doesn't pay too long!
