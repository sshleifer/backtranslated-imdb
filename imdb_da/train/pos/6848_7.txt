A very silly movie, starting with a soft porn sequence, ventures into the farcelike comedy in the art gallery, adds a choke for a discovery in the hotel room and introduces a random murder without any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> The following is bizarre and surreal (especially the stopwatch scene is exquisitely unnecessary) that culminates in a revealing "twist" end that is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer (see the trivia section for just that why it is deliberately unfair). <The film goes out of its way to be as offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, the insane and the wonderful "Huggie Bear" style racial stereotypes on the subway - and graciously treat the viewer as an idiot in the final scenes that endlessly explain each other in detail and again and again what has just happened in the movie. Although the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to see. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a pleasure to watch despite its many many errors, the whole package just, Well, works.
