I've been trying to find out about this series for years! Thanks, IMDb! I saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind. Of course, as a 6-year-old, I was especially affected by the Cyclops episode, which was quite chilling (I talked so much that my older brother made me cyclops out of a plastic hollow figure I still have) What I also remember was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the start - mysterious, tight and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I experienced the same feeling. It's a very difficult thing to catch - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every 'Odyssey' I've seen since has been a huge downfall. The characters in this series seemed real, real people - old Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a real masterpiece! But - why is it not better known? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? I just love to have the chance to see this again!
