Bill Paxton stars in and leads this very original movie. After seeing the first time I was aware of how good it was. The reviews I had heard were OK. As a result, I expected an average thriller at most. But because of Paxton's excellent management and action of the movie is worth watching, especially if you are a horror movie fanatic. The movie is also helped with the plot phrases that continue until the final credits. The movie's strongest point is the story that I have to say is very original and is like I've ever seen before. Well done to the 2 young leaders who perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. I give this movie 9/10 and I strongly recommend that everyone catch it.
