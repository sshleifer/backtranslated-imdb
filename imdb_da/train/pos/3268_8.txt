A charming romantic comedy. The reason is a little too complicated - I tried to sum it up three times and I can't. Suffice to say it is worth seeing. The movie is fun, beautiful - the plot is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so good - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The action is amazing - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd is in top shape and enjoys every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just ok but fine. If you are a sucker for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), catch this one. Downey also looks great in his underwear! Extra Bonuses - The title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All", which was sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
