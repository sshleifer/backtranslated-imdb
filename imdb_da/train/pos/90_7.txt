Yes, the poster is something terrible. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was okay ... Nothing really great ... I just hoped he would be a hardcore druggie and totally rubbish his life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but it can't happen to rich kids, can it now? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds large ballroom parties and has a nice well-kept lawn in front of the mini mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... the child is too good to get his life completely rubbish. After all, who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor, little rich children ... in their nice beautiful house with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they all get addicted to drugs, survive their lives and end up in jail ... so maybe we can see movies that aren't all about the poor, little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
