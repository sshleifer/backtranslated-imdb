For the viewer who comes after it long after its production, "Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca." As you look at it, you get the feeling that you are looking at a number of clichés that occur so often in the genre; Then you realize that the clichés first became clichés after they were copied from this movie and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great. In other words, it is a usual job. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a joy to see. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and yet it still contains a number of phrases that surprise you. Dialogue, pacings and Mann's direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you are a fan, this is a "must-see", but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to smaller characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cuts, it lent additional realism to the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably undervalued movie and it's worth watching. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart, which gives a little background on the film.
