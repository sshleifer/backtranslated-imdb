This is one of the first movies I can remember, or maybe the first one. Exactly the beautiful kind of movie than introducing a child sweetly into the world of violence and addiction where we live. A little bit of Babe, Casino and Constantine, all well mixed in a cardboard and we get it here. I don't know if it's really classified for kids, but I think it was very cool, very fun and interesting. I hate when a movie (especially a cardboard) can have a good end and its destruction because every character must have a good end, even if it sounds weird (I'm not a bitter person). But it was ok, he simply goes in heaven and they leave it that way. <br /> <br /> All this is just a critic, it's a good movie something new. very touching and i have to go
