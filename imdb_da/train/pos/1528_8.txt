I am a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime partner - good, pure fun, good humor and nostalgia for Dick van Dykes show. How innocent we all were (and how innocent is Diagnosis murder). I especially enjoyed the episodes of other nostalgia characters like Joe Mannix. The evil guys are always caught, the good guys continue. The stars clearly enjoy themselves and have a ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> A beef: why were so many crooks women or at least bitches? Amanda was too dizzy. It's hard to imagine that she really does something as cruel as an autopsy. I hope we haven't seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and the family on our screens, esp. at lunch time !!
