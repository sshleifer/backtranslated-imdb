I was a little scared to watch this movie because of its rates. But staying in Italy titles like this never comes across, and I love steps so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning". It touches and is well-written and orderly. Raya is so strong in character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused and AWARE of her talent (and what talent Rutina Wesley has, my jaw fell into the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is honestly inspiring. Also, the fact that she is not the typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really appealing and genuine. Seriously, why is this film rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really good indeed. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance dinners are just sick.
