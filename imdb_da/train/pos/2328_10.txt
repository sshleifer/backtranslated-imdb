Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to be wrong - the back window looks a bit sporadic at times, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the best-performing music score in our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Cabiria Nights is a little too slow - But this movie is perfectly done from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The writing is brilliant, the play is amazing (though Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole spectacle is shining), the management and photography are inspired, and the music score touches without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that is too manipulative). Every sad moment is really moving, every moment gives me smile. This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I wish there were more movies like that. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon has gone to the star for this movie, but I'm sorry to see her recent movie is so much more escapist and stupid than this serious movie acting about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.
