This is a very good movie. Want to know the real reasons why so many here are beating this movie? I will tell you. In this movie you have a black criminal who overlooks a white professor. A black policeman telling the white professor is wrong to defend the black criminal, and the black policeman turns out to be real. Make the white professor look stupid. It always comes down to race. This is an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can get over it, there are characters played by blacks in this movie, which outsmart the white characters, so you should have no trouble enjoying this movie. I recommended everyone to watch this movie.
