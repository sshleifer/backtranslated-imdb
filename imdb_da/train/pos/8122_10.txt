I have never seen this movie before I bought the tape last year. I was thrilled and entertained. It has all the elements of what I love to see in a Sci-Fi story, in a book or on the screen. There are social comments, speculations and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something creepy and entertaining and sees a 1936 picture of the distant future in the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see and not just for Sci-Fiers.
