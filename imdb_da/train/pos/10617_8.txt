Beautiful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their homes have fallen through and all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Wouldn't you know, Ernest and the savvy partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a great secret in their basement: Pitiable, deformed, pale "Junior" (Stephen Furst in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls. <br /> <br /> A deliciously unheard of Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely on an intense confrontation / climax that delivers horror in small doses until the last half hour. The hotel and the prehistoric cellar - great echoes of "Psycho" here - are great options. Most of all, it involves perverse plot incest and patricide, so the film gets a really dark quality. And yet it also becomes exciting as we realize that junior is not a dimensionally evil bogeyman, but just as much a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a solid little scarecrow worth finding. <br /> <br /> 8/10
