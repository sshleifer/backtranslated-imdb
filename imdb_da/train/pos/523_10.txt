Why is this movie not the best 250? This film still looks amazingly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only have been made in the aftermath of W.W.II because of the perception of the proximity of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all the people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer-a typical British judge), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey), who defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against the American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey Ithere is a reason why is an American). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing movie, which is a true "tour-de-force". The film is clear: in the universe, the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between people. The way this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood movie could ever do.
