This unclear de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said, "The soft shall inherit the earth." This story of classes on the surface, but really an allegory for all the homeless who populated Europe after the Great War. They are homeless but cheerful, in a society that is too poor and selfish, to care for or acknowledge them, footsteps to the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as an adventure, a cinderella story. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I cannot predict if deus ex machina is the construction of the author or Vittorio. It begins with the words "Sometime to ..." to exemplify the timelessness of its narrative, for history could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut the leg, the homeless moody, especially when they begin to give their desires and an end straight out of a Spielberg image, make this boulange a pleasure for everyone. The Sica's most accessible image is also one of his best. He abandoned neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking, he creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the hope of continuing to walk in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
