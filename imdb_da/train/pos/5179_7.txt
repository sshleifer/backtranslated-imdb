Indian Summer is a hot movie with several characters that would make a nice afternoon movie (with little editing). The film begins in the past, where a group of children is shown a moose, which sets the tone perfectly before it is cut into the present when a group of adults from the camp's "golden age" is invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday at the camp camp. , Uncle Lou. The movie then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times in the camp and create new memories in their recent stay. The movie succeeds in the amazing way it brings across its characters in this beautiful setting, allowing them to evolve without having to worry about plot developments. Looking at these people reminds, and their relationship with each other is what the movie is about and why it works so well. It never goes over the top and melodramatic, and always keeps its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie where nostalgia is caught so well and found myself drawn in, although I have never been to one of these camps as a child myself. <br /> <br /> For a warm nostalgic character movie, I sincerely recommend.
