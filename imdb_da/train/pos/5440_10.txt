A trio of friends, sergeants all in the British army, carouse & brawl their way across imperial India. Intense loyal to each other meets their biggest and most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a fierce cult and its demented, irreconcilable guru. Now they have to rely on the regent's smallest servant, the water carrier, to save your queen's soldiers from certain massacres. <br /> <br /> Based more on the three musketeers than Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a dignified entry into Hollywood's golden year 1939. Filled with excitement and humor while keeping romantic interludes in it minimum, it takes the viewer into account and upholds the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> Discussing the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., which are performances, are virtually fruitless as they really are all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and for all purposes & purpose is not distinguished. But it doesn't reduce any of the fun by just watching them have a brilliant time. (It is interesting to note that MEPs that McLaglen boasted of a prominent First World War military career; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War II - mainly in secret affairs and earn no less than 4 honorary jackets after the conflict, while Grant allegedly worked undercover for British Intelligence and watched Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) <br /> <br /> The real actors here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with glorious dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's dictation sand. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is properly stalwart as regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as Thuggee Guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, is effective but has little to do. Movie's stomach recognizes Cecil Kellaway in the small role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The movie chooses its crooks well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-blown Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the Indian life course for 6 centuries, ritually strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British military, in collaboration with a number of prince states, eventually succeeded in suppressing religion. So far, it would remain things of novels and nightmares.
