It has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action girl. I've seen this movie nearly 10 times, and it's a great effort from Gautham. From my perspective, I think this movie is almost flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt..classic.Jyothika played his role as Maya very well. The character suits her very well. The character who received film-goers' attention was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. Red and Terrible. Jeevan deservedly won the Best Villain Prize in ITFA 2004. The supportive cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others worked well. <br /> <br /> Racy manuscripts, perfect timed dialogues and brilliant tale of Gautham. The soundtrack of Harris Jeyaraj is all chart busters, while BGM fits the movie very well. Cinematography by RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well. Anthony's editing is accurate. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop movie filled with real doses of action and romance. Even some Hollywood movies can't compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
