This complicated Western was a landmark in JAMES STEWART's career after his return from war service, who wanted to change his image by making a Western one, which is largely considered the cause of the influx of Westerns in the 50s, as it is much impressive. Too bad it was not photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins the first prize for the "winner of the West", but then you have to use the rest of the movie and try to restore it when it is stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady gal with a creepy reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local bad boy in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad girlfriend. And you wouldn't know it's a Universal-International movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both unknown at that time) have a bit of roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence has the first Indian attack, whereby CHARLES DRAKE turns out to be a sweep that rides off and leaves Shelley alone in the horse carriage. He later redeems himself, but it is just one of the terms that has the gun going from one harmless hand to another - but finally ends up with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have the ultimate shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as DUEL IN THE SUN's blazing weapon finale. McNally is the perfect villain, and DAN DURYEA is just as treacherous in the vicious role he played through the 40s as a low-key gunslinger. Tightly constructed history is very orderly by Anthony Mann, and it is fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) wearing Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier throwing longing glances at the so slim and attractive Shelley Winters. Worth seeing and definitely an above average story.
