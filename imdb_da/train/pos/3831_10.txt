This is a free adaptation of the novel Clarence Mulford; fans of the Willaim Boyd movies are likely to feel a little offshore here (and the reviews so far reflect it). But I knew about Hopalong, first and foremost, from the Romans and never had care for the Boyd movies when I came to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he hasn't made a nostalgic "Western"; instead, he has addressed the Cassidy story as a piece of what we used to call 'Americana'; or which older critics once called 'homespun'. When the movie was shaken, I was increasingly reminded of the great "Hallmark Theater" version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It", with James Garner telling. Both of these films remind us that even though movies about the 'old west' are probably always mythical to the Americans, they don't have to be 'westerns'; They may well just be movies about what it meant to be American at that time, in that place. I never feel pandered to watch this movie; There is no effort to push Boyd-Cassidy's legacy into our throats, no irony, no camp. Consequently, I get a sense of these characters as having gone - or riding a horse - over some real western America I could also have gone a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> In view of that, the film's weariness - it positively avoids everything we've come to call "style" - is all for our benefit; and the executive artist's plain fits nicely into this; Gosh, it really feels like a story told about a bonfire on a cattle drift - no visual dressing, just quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - which we expect from the good story of a fairy tale yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised at this movie and if the viewer puts away the expected expectations, he or she will find great pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie 9 stars, but I will give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely; and I urge them to set aside their memories of Boyd and give this movie a try. <br /> <br /> Note 1: One reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people dead in this movie instead of shooting their arms out of their hands (ala Boyd's Cassidy); First, Cassidy shoots people dead in the novels; Second, if Cassidy was a true cowboy, he would have shot people dead - the problem of firearms out of people's hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtitle of this great movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have the director of "The Godfather" among those who can have them all the opportunities to make movies that I can't ; but a good movie is a good movie; And it's a good movie. If it is by someone named "Coppola" then it is just as it is. America is the opportunity for land (or was until Bush came to the office) - that's what the great American novels are about.
