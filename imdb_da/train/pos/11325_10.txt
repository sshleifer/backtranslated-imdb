When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say it out of all the shows I've seen, the top of it all. I had to see this show and that was what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was best. I really liked the animation and all the fighting scenes were awesome. I must say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber, and Archer and of course I also Illya. And of course, all the episodes of the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) who plays Berserkers voice. He has a cool character. And I even saw the whole series all the time again before I saw the last volume. So if you see something good, then watch this show, it's the best.
