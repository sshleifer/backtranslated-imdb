Lynch proves that, like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man," he shows his critics that he can tell a straightforward, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (experimentally played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor over a few states to pay a final visit to his brother-in-law, who is now at death. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite rural photography (love these airfield grain shoots) and a dull instructor hand revealing human basic humanity, this is a beautiful piece of life movie. Its extremely slow pace can trick some viewers into sleeping, but those who stop together on the trip will be well rewarded in the end.
