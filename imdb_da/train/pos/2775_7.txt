Old movie buffs want to know why I would call this one "The Man in the Gray Flannel Robe." Most biblical films are basically schlock-what can call up smiles and giggle here is how Peck is trying to raise awareness of a number of psychological and social issues with the spear that carry Neanderthals all about him. As a great romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. But there is something poignant about this movie. Of all the great Hollywood Bible pictures, the most striking one produces the average American ambivalent attitude toward faith in the biblical God. Billy Sunday's dissertation elaborates on H.L. Mencken's antithesis throughout the script. Who gets the better of it in the celestial-supported synthesis depends on your point of view. Aside from that, D & B has a good performance of Peck (especially in the final conversion scene) and of Jayne Meadows as his bitterest first wife Michol, living, moody atmosphere (good idea to put most action at dawn or evening) and it reproduction of the 20th third psalm at the end.
