Saw this movie on its release and has treasured it since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find casting one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). Really enjoyed watching dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a hoot. The script is clever, slim and heavy-in-cheek, damn fun on almost everything "Beverley Hills". Loved Paul Bartel's "doctor" and Ray Sharkey's servant. This was raunchy and raw, but thank goodness! Unless you are a prude, I heartily recommend this movie. FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees by Kevin Bacon, was Mary Woronov & Paul Bartel in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in "Comets Night". They were all three in "Eat Raoul".
