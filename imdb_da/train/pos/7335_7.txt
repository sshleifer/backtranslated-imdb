With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films look like two-sided swords. You get something ugly out of it, but only if you stick to the silly and unnecessarily cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story, which may not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great achievement from Bakshi from an animation point of view. Rotoscoping is much more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look. You still get some of the boring still cells and slightly blurred background paintings, but on all the look it has certainly improved since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style for it, and unlike in LOTR, where this style often contradicted the actual content, it enhances the movie's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film fails to make a meaningful story out of its simple setting, and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurry. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the biggest villain Necron was hard to follow, not to mention the guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as just 'That Guy'). Although most of the voice actors were appropriate, there are some odd quirks in the audio department, and Tigra sounds particularly awful when she screams. But I think the film's intrinsic entertainment value outweighs its unnecessary silly performance of the plot line. The sharp clad of characters is something you never come across, but it helps you to remind yourself that perhaps this movie is not even meant to be taken too seriously. It's still a hella cool and really fun.
