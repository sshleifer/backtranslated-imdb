The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the second is the more well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's characteristics: dangerous women, trust games, and characters that are not as weak as others suspect them to be or harmless . <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is great as a former boxer disqualified from the sport of life because of an event in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to cool back story) and the little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a fantastic performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweetly talking grabber Uncle Bud subtly commands his own scene. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this movie, so keep it ready to be sucked into the cavity.
