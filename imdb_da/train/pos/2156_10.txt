This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others being Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with these films as with so many great foreign films is that it takes an everyday slice of life and transforms it into a deeply dangerous lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man saddened by his lively life and the brink of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out of a dance studio. The moment it takes his train to pass, he is thrilled by her. But is it only at her beauty, at her television or a connection, that they will both discover that they are sharing? <br /> <br /> To dance, we have memorable wonderful characters to deal with painful realities by crossing them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, they risk too happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the secular by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.
