I grew up in South West Virginia; I am about the same age as (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", the book that forms the true history of this heartwarming movie. <br /> <br /> And then I have a close connection to the West Virginia coal mine theme, and the amazing effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on us all. The Rocket Boys continued to make good lives for themselves. I continued to get my degrees in physics and computer technology. Since Sputnik woke up many young people to "Science Gap", the United States had in the United States in the cold war days ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia at the end of the 1950s, it will touch the essence of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; see it; Recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
