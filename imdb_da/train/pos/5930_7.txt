Monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) suck the vitality of virgins, and their newest goal is pretty lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches. I have never been a fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellers such as King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is actually not nearly as bad as it could be. Yes, it is sometimes terribly horrible, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned cemetery, scary soundtrack and candlelit-gothic house scene, mirror showing the fateful villains, etc. Of course, the movie is contaminated by Mr Dung's potty -mouthed dialogue and all-tactic-of-toilet sperm to deceive obese people, leading to utterly meaningless subplot of rape teacher, but there are roses among fertilizers.
