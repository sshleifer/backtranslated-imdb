I just watched Hot Millions on TCM and I had completely forgotten this gem. Ustinov creates a wise and divisive plot that has him wisely going from two to human to brilliant ... Now you have to see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a bumbling secretary / neighbor who has a hard time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that radiates through in this image. She creates a fine portrayal of a warm, witty and genuine person who, in the long run ... well ... Molden and Newhart as top leaders take the challenge of making what could be banal roles and getting them to come out in their own comic life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see, and I know at least in Rome's case Ustinov expands a helping hand of work. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a shot back in the rising age of the computer and it is a problem for the average man or man for that matter, but actually the characters are so involved and so funny to watch that computer's subplot is almost lost ... I almost say. <br /> <br /> Let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the amazing performances and friendly, forgiving, and deeply involved plot in this image.
