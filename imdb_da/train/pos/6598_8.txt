I watched this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. I find it hard to really understand Brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and classic differences. Seeing this movie in SÃ£o Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows some of many Brazilians' everyday lives. On the other hand, it is sometimes a bit over-razed. And that's the only negative comment I have on this movie. It is sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could film some things a little more subtly, it would make the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I liked the movie and the way the story itself is. The characters are complex, and much like real people. Not beautiful American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. It makes the film realistic, even when the story is not so compelling.
