Lavish production values ​​and solid performances in this fair adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic about the marriage play within and between the classes of the provincial 18th century England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mix like friends who have to pass through jealousies and lies to discover they love each other. Good humor is a persistent virtue that goes a long way towards explaining the availability of the old source material (which has been toned down in its harsh skepticism). I liked the look of the movie and how shots were created, and I thought it wasn't too much on succession shots like most other 80's and 90's movies. Very good results.
