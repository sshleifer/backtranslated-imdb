Let's keep it simple: My two children were glued to this movie. It has its faults from an adult perspective, but buys some gels and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, though she's not in the movie much, so don't be too excited there. <br /> <br /> That's not really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you only see once. Don't buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (It was for the dangers.)
