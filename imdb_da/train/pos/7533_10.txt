I loved this series when it was on Kids WB, I didn't think there was a Batman spin off when the original show ended in 1995, and this show came in 1997. First of all, I loved the idea that Robin left Batman to solve crime alone. It was an interesting perspective on their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again as its predecessor, this had great stories, great animation (better than the original), great voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing I didn't like was when it was in the US, it would often run into a 15 minute story. I just wanted some episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of Batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's Bill". All in all, a good follow-up with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
