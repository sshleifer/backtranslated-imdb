Another Downey must see! If you are an obsessed fan like me, you have to watch this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale degree who realizes that the life he just entered is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a non-nonsense lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on their one year anniversary when he is hit by a car. He demands to go back only this time in Alex Finch's body. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs. Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as recovery. And if so, how often do you meet the same soul lives after life. I don't know the answer. But I know you should watch this movie. It's a rebellion, and Downey looks so good in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It just gets recycled.
