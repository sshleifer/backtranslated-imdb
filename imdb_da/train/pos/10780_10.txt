Far by my penultimate favorite cartoon, Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Although the reviews were low, so what I still enjoyed it and loved it, was so much fun and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just amazing, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this cartoon again, was so amazing and the jokes were brilliant. Also I can remember the hilarious moment when Brain came in, you hear his voice, and it played the PATB theme instrumental, it was just amazing, I love it in the comics when cameos came in. I want this cartoon and Animaniacs to come back, I loved them
