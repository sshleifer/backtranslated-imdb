For those of you who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "minor" movies from later in his career. And even though it's not a good movie compared to many of his other pictures, it's not bad and it's a decent time - but not much more. Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason she decides to explain to poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, cold and detached wife Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the witch's control book, this is a definite no, no !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its feelings about the witches. They are neither the victims nor the almighty variety. Most of their magic is rather limited and meaningless (as Jack Lemmon uses his power to turn off street lamps). And, strangely, the witches seem to be bohemians hanging out in hip bars, where you might find people wearing bears and listening to crappy jazz. Considering what I think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world! In any case, the film is quite romantic and mildly comical, but nothing I would rush to see. The play is pretty good, but the script doesn't give enough payout to make this an excellent movie - actually I almost scored the movie a 6 - it was really close.
