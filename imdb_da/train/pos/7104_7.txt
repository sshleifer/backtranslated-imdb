Los Debutantes is the story of two orphan brothers who have moved to Santiago from the south after their mother dies. The self-confident and street-shaped Silvio, the older brother, gets a job working for a gossip stake club owner after taking the naive Victor there for his 17th birthday. As Silvio flourishes under his boss's leadership, both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, characters are transformed as we begin to see the subtle and open ways that each manipulate the next. The film is well made with good film and fast pacing. It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. It uses the now popular technique to add different scenes from different views out of chronological order. Many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other great movies using this device. The actual plot is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Massefotion and many other good movies noir. As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters develops and their motivation. While the plot may be some clich√©, it is also wise and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would call it an enjoyable movie worth seeing, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many films from Chile and it is always interesting to watch movies noir from other countries. Other than that, rent it if it is available but do not lose sleep if it is not.
