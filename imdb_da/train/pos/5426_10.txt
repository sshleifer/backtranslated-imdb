It's about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can't say exactly how many times I've seen this fine movie, but I never need it. The main players worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. I just can't get over their exploits in India. Your first glimpse at Sergeant Three is when you see them engaging in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called tax card. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what has happened to the communication line and they come into a most abandoned city - or they believe. <br /> <br /> They get involved in the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" in hiding. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by a group of wizards and have hardly come to flight to the base. Later they are sent on another mission, which gives Sgt Cutter a chance to hunt for the gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil Kali followers. Yours sent to get help and Cutter gets caught. Soon, McChesney and Ballentine will come with you, and they are confused. <br /> <br /> In the face of being killed, they look helpless as their regiment is going to save them. The evil perpetrators see and are spreading their surprise attack when a wounded man climbs up the golden dome and blows his bugle, which then warns the British to the ambush. Thus you are shot dead. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the evil and soon defeat them. At the end, Your Honor is honored when he is an honorary corporal in the British Army.
