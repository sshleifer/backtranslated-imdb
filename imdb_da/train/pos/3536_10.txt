EA has shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60s world. The graphics in the game are excellent and the recording is also very professional. I got this game April 2007 (two years after the release) and I'm still impressed with the gameplay. It's a shame that the EA will no longer make 007 games. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone aged 13 or over. The only thing I didn't like in the game is the Russian boat level, it was too much pressure. All in all, I like the game a lot !!
