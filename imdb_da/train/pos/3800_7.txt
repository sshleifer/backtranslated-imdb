The world of Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world. Planetaryides, buildings, and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere, while the earth falls against most signs, nowhere is to be seen. It's a world reminiscent of Neverending Story, as Nothing came to eat the world away. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the villain is also the world's gobbler. This time it is a large skeleton suit with burning eyes. The heroes are a great but tacit warrior, an annoying and greedy sidekick who controls the entrepreneur's side of the duo and a strange useless animal. They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my fate, did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. The voices and sounds are top notch. Too little is the story as simple as one can imagine. They go to stop World Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. The end. No real character development or story events. Not even those I would expect from a movie with such a plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's a cute thing to look at, kids would enjoy it, but it's about it. No depth to this world (saying calculated).
