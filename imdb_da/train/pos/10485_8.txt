I saw it last night on TV, and was very pleased. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of movie that makes you feel lovely and warm around the heart and believe there's still some goodness in the world (all neighbors pretended not to see what grace did to help her and protect her - the old policeman is my favorite), even though you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved shopping (they all seemed like ordinary, ordinary people living in small quaint English coastal town), but the biggest thing in the movie was white and humor it has! Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their "tea"! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the end was a bit confusing, but it didn't stop me really, really enjoying the whole story!
