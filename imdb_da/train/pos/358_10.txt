The color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps the people who are severely affected by the struggles of life. Each character had an element of the color purple in them. The film touches love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. if Celie has lived through hell and loses her sister, and Shug enters her life to show her love again, Albert is not a man directed his favor against Celie, Shug cursed by her father and finally confesses him, Sofia and her Stubbornness Good and Bad, and even Nettie, they had their emptiness and adversity through the movie, but were eventually overcome and that is a sign of a good movie. Good job for everyone they threw and the crew.
