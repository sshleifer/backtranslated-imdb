By saying that, I think this is not a well-made movie, but it is a very good version of the real event and the best portrayal so far.And if you are a WW2 buff then it is a treat for you because There are three out of four saboteurs playing roles in this movie. It's theater performs at best, but it's still as said before a semi-documentary. I personally am a deadly fan of our almost over-human heroes in World War II, and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did, it will not be forgotten by the next generations. Because children today do not read books, they see movies. <br /> <br /> So if you want an extraordinary action, hire Private Ryan, this is the truth about long-lasting pain, outrageous perseverance and the will to fight when everything seems to be lost.
