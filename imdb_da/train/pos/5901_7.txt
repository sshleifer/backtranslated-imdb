It's a rehash of many newer films, only this one has fewer stars, less complications and a more fuzzy feel to it. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (unknown) begins its process of being arranged. At no time are the two strangers married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who go through the movements similar to theirs. When they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and / or mature and love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, you've seen this movie. The plot connections are the same, which is not a single surprising element throughout the two and a half hours of the movie. Everything is predictable. I only enjoyed it because I had seen 'Darling' (also with the lead characters Deol & Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in it so I said "why not" when my sister suggested we also rented 'Just married' . <br /> <br /> See it: Because Kirron Kher is a fellow star and her usual treasure is in it. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've got enough of all this couple party nonsense! <br /> <br /> C +
