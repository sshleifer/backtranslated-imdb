"Shall we dance?" A glowing flick from Japan tells of an overtime accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees from the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio is teaching dance and most of all himself. Fun, exciting and completely charming, "SWD" is an award-winning movie worth watching at more mature viewers. (B)
