I really enjoyed this movie. The act of the adult actors was great, although I found the main child a bit stiff. But he did very well to be a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. Ie Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably won't like this as it's a bit slower pace. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say that the picture quality is top notch. Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were also cool. They deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing, as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.
