This movie is wonderful in every way that modern action adventure is not. Take some time. Relax, enjoy. Think. People who watch this movie as slow or plodding or boring must really take a week away and watch it several times until their brief attention spans the possibility of being involved in a case or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no one else reason because it does not rush to do the points you so much need to do in a short time. First, I was worried about Brosnan playing an American native. Given the history line though, I think it was coincidental to cast. Now back to my hermiting. -Jahfre
