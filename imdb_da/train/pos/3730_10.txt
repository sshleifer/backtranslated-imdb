If you want to watch a movie and have a good time watching it, the Tigerland movie is for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The movie's perfect scenes look so real; It's almost like a documentary about something that happened in reality, but with drama. Boy, I'm telling you ... REAL drama, they actually "fought" in one of the scenes (make the DVD listen to the comment is not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape a terrible fate. Having seen saving private Ryan, I have an understanding of what a "fake fate" is and know exactly how the men in the movie feel. I see this movie as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Save Private Ryan." What do men do when they are in a "hard-pressed" situation in real life? Some men become insane, some men cry, some men through fists, others do drugs, some randomly sleep with hookers attempt to eradicate the importance of love from their lives, some try to drink the pain away, some jump off buildings or bridges , some feel guilty and others feel so much pain it makes them so sick they collapse - physically. This movie has all the desperate feelings rolled into a ball. But don't make me wrong, it's not depressing movie, its realistic, it's a very very humorous movie, the cheeky and funny Bozz (Collin's character) shines it all, and in addition there are about five female actresses in the movie; I will let you figure out what they are in there for! With dialogue, war / action sequences, picture perfect scenes with appropriate music; This movie has it all as I said: from top to bottom. I do not why Tigerland is heavily under-credited. The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it is written in great boldness "The Best Movie of the Year", and it clearly falls nothing short of that. Keep the rare gems coming to Hollywood 10/10.
