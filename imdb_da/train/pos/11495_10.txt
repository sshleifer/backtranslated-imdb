We saw this at one of the local art cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, TX. It was a total surprise in relation to the rewrite in the theater's newsletter, but we were both blown away by the artwork. It was beautifully finished and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (German name for the Château) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of sexual relations between a group of twenty men and women isolated from the daily limitations. It is fantastic at several levels than I can remember. We came home after the movie and talked and talked at 4 in the morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer then movies in (probably the original) German version. I searched and searched for a video tape version, but never came up with anything. Would absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of this. It explores relationships at a basic level and is also a good tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the author / instructor, please convince him to release again, preferably on DVD these days. I can't even imagine getting tired of seeing the sincere achievements of the actors who are now all in their four series. Please bring it back.
