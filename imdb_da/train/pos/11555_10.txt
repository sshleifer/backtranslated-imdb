A simple comment ... What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can see over and over again. It is certainly one of the top ten comedies. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau formulate a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his game. <br /> <br /> It is true that the life situation is made perfect. If you have digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to give what is on. It usually gives this movie ***% stars, but in reality it deserves **** stars. If you really see this movie, you can tell that it will be just as fun and fresh a hundred years from now.
