This movie is well done on so many levels that I am in awe that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) due to this writing). This movie has amazing special effects, a real epic story, complex great character interaction and mind-boggling fighting - they must be seen as believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I got (some lines were not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just don't understand when I read and hear from various sources: "It has a confusing plot ....", "I couldn't follow the story ...." or "Characters came from nowhere ...". From the very first time I saw this movie I understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there and I absolutely loved it! I've seen it about 8 times already, and every time it's pure pleasure. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many other Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who feel the same. Not one of them failed to follow the story, and each person declared their love for this movie. Oh man, why can't we have things like this coming out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a lovely marriage with special effects, character development and history. <br /> <br /> This doesn't come from an Asian movie lover, either. I own an extensive library of Asian movies, and I have to say that this movie is one of my greatest DVDs. When you see it, you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feelings of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantasy world and you will not leave! I have seen both the 1983 version and 2001 (both made by Tsui Hark), and 2001 is much better in comparison to IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I have a further complaint about this movie: I didn't want to end it. I ask you Mr. Hark - can we please have a successor?
