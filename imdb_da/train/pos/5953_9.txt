I understand that Paramount would film this with the Rodgers and Hart score, but could not solve the copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen who wrote between them the most songs for Bing Crosby contributed to a very nice score. <Br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin and said that this movie "fits Crosby as a glove" and I couldn't have said it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949, Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood. For once Paramount was used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming never lovelier on the screen. This was a woman for whom technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn origins look like, but it's a good cartoon. The trio in Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a beautiful good time busy doing nothing. Bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe on the Moon. The third song he once sings for himself by himself and with Rhonda Fleming. The song was nominated for the best song, but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Also nice that Bing managed to record the score to Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like the Road Pictures, but Bing was a comic talent on himself and this movie shows better than anyone else. This is Crosby at the top of his game.
