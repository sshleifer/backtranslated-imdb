I loved this movie! I'm a real Tom Hanks fan, and I've always been impressed with all his work. From his most dramatic roles such as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saves Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles as One's Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, Lady Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an up and coming star, showing great promise in Hollywood co-stars like Hank's son, delivering nothing short of good performance. He is certainly someone to take care of his career, I think he will do good things. Paul Newman always delivers a brilliant performance on the screen. He is really a legend. We can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the movie, but still contributed to doing it well. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is performing in the Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Female, I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and does a great job. Liam Aiken is another found treasure in film. He does such a great job with such a small role, and as his roles in Lemony Snickets and Sweet November, and I dream of Africa, he gives a good performance.
