This is NOT as bad a movie as some reviewers, and as the summary on the IMDB page for this movie, it says is. Why? Firstly, the fact that the filmmakers in 1984 were bold enough to confront, as one of the record elements, the issue of domestic violence - so, reviewers complaining about the plot are missing one of the key points! Secondly, the musical climax would not work if the reviewers who say that only the music is good, once again missed one of the points - Especially why it is so good ... because all the music in this movie has a plotel element background that makes music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For first-time film producers and directors, it's just not that bad! There are far worse movies out there by accomplished filmmakers !! And lastly, the reviewers who say the music is "good" has also missed the point - check out the range of stylistic musical treatments, the variety, the musicality, and the performance of the Prince scene - truly one of a kind, musical, where no one else went during the 1980s and with a style seen in other artists' work (clothing and movement: what costume elements came first, Michael Jackson's or Prince's? See also if you can spot the splayed fingers sweep in front of the eyes, which Prince does in this movie, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction". Like the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all.
