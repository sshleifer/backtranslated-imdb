This is a very exciting and romantic film. I've seen it several times and never get bored with it. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. In fact, I prefer this movie to Braveheart as Braveheart contains so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scene and the last fence scene. These are really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is lovely ... it really fits the movie. The setting is fantastic.
