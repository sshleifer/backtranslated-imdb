This movie is such a moving, great work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 and didn't get it really "get it" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course and I own it now) just blown away. Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from the beginning to the end. I've also read the book, but there's just something about the movie that really brings it to life. casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it's just amazing. you laugh, you cry, you raise ... it brings out all feelings imaginable. It's one of his finest pieces of work and shouldn't be missed!
