A woman left alone after her husband's death finds herself attracted to her son's friend and handy husband. In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins to sleep with the practical man in an attempt to revive. The twisted part? The practical man is also her daughter on and without love. <br /> <br /> As if it wasn't strange enough, the mother manages to fall for this man, and when the daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her crushed life on her poor mother. Though you may be thinking badly about this woman, it is the truth that controls movies to portray her in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, has this character dimension and depicts great emotions. <br /> <br /> A truly brilliant performance and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
