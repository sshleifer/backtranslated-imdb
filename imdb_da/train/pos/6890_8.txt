This was one of the highlights of ST: TNG's semi-forgettable second season before they grew up or grew into their own in the third season and beyond. This was not just a showcase for up-and-comers like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but was also the continuation of data searching for his 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. I am still disappointed that there is no credit for the actor whose character Okona should have a try (after Teri Hatcher's character) before being disturbed by Lt Worf. I remember seeing this episode "first round" on my girlfriend's comic book back in the day, and we all thought she would have been a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady is ...
