This is a great game! Okay maybe it didn't have any of the features it was supposed to have, but Digital Anvil has still come up with a good game. There is some resemblance to Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo broken ships, go on missions), but this game has a strong scripted mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! You basically fly a spaceship around a system and work your way up! The game has some pretty good graphics, although it was made in 2003. It should run well on even a modest PC. The story contains some good voices from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (she appears in all computer games). Hold on to the story, it gets better and better as it continues. There is even a racing section where you and an opponent have to drive your spaceships around a course (that means you go through the rings). This section took me a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit hard here and there, but generally you can beat this game. The game has an active scene against the web. Pick up some mods to expand the game. I haven't played any of the games yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a successor to this was canceled, a shame!
