Well, the movie isn't exactly "fun". Okay, I admit there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely not something that is ridiculously incredible. For example: Immediately before a steaming sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars, sh the handcuff to the bedspread, and he can't remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her: "Okay, don't go anywhere." Look, humorous, but not fun. <br /> <br /> The reason and trades are pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is warm and sexy, and there is a really steaming scene with her that you can't help rewind and watch again. <br /> <br /> There are also some very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> Total 5 stars. I would only give it three if not to Erika Eleniak.
