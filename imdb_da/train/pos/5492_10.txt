I have been impressed with Chavez's attitude to globalization once, but it was not until I saw the film at the Amsterdam Film Festival's international film festival that I realized what he really achieved. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy of Venezuela's elite, the oil companies and the oil of corrupt Western governments, to remove democratically elected President Chavez and return Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This movie is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of the world! I recommend the people of Venezuela to take matters into their own hands and save their country from eg. Halliburton and the Bush regime.
