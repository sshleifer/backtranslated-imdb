Frailty - 8/10 - It's non-sensual title and "Bill Paxton Directs" heading aside, this is a pretty good old-fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller. Eventually it may end up being the inbred Southern Gothic cousin of Kubrick's "The Shining" --- but hey, it's a pretty amazing entertaining show. It also has a doozy of a plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that people from now on will catch late in the evening on the base cable and scare the beesus out of themselves to see it. For poor director Bill Paxton had to rent a star ... oh yes .... still a devil of a good rental.
