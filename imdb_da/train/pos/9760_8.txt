I have very good memories of this movie, which I saw it with my two younger sisters, when it was first shown theatrically in 1977, and I was eight years old. Apparently, it was considered an error - and is now virtually forgotten (the pan and scan video cassette - which never made the picture right, or it is ambitious Panavision compositions, is now out of print). The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and certainly uneven. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite, while others are somewhat juvenile and incomprehensible. The sad discarded blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue song are really heartwarming. Joe Raposo songs are mostly simply beautiful. Absolutely a worthy curiosity that is likely to fall into total ambiguity.
