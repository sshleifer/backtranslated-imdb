Many judge it as a fan service film, because a lot of superstar starring in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are very famous singer in Japan). But don't judge it before you see, that's what I say. Gackt and employees are very serious when they made this movie and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a soothing story inside. Several scenes can be so fun, and some others are so sad. They did so well until I couldn't stop seeing it all over again. <br /> <br /> The story has written pretty well, but I admit their action is a little disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde, because his ability to act is under the other, and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with another language except his native language (Japan). But it's understandable, because it's their first time to shop in the movie. I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their lives. When Toshi was killed when Sho asked Kei to do Yi-Che to be a vampire like him because he didn't want to let her die when Sho's Brother died, Kei Shoot died son and the best and beautiful scene is when Sho disappear ~ even I told you that Hyde's skill is still weird, but I give him two stupid ones on that scene !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast as they do not tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and be Sho's enemy because they are a good friend in the past and also son is Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love this movie ~ (very much ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
