Go far back to page ten in this review section and work your way back up. Continue; I am waiting. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, then you've probably seen the same trend that I have. You can nitpick all day long about the paralyzed jokes, dated timing and obviously derived plot points and shtick in 'Bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those "hate me now, love me later" flicks. <br /> <Bill and Ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to the 80s children who followed the trend and looked ahead of fashion. It worked fine for the original, but apparently bombed in 1991, when no self-sufficient slacker would be caught dead wearing anything other than flannel or admit he liked something in the 80s. As Ted would say, "Dude, this is a deep hole. Do you want to play 20 questions?" They say that nostalgia is in its 20-year cycle, and it certainly seems to be here. Here in 2010, the users who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth began to look back to appreciate some of the pivotal films that (like it or not) made us who we are. If you are one of those looking at 'Bogus' as if it were an outdated ("Fa gs!") Ripoff, then you are missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair, wearing flannel and you look like you just crawled out of the bed. <br /> <br /> In self-referencing, its own origin (Star Trek episode "and time to travel with a phone box), B & T makes no attempt to hide the love of its creators for tribute. Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I'm not saying 'Bogus' is 'True Love', but I think it should be appreciated for what it is: a fun snapshot of our society at a time before child psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking ads, terror paranoia and spread of media fear mongering. <br /> <br /> So for all you B & T hats out there ... turn off your cd for screaming trees, take that hair out of your face, go to the beach and light up. Narcissistic depression and intellectual energy are SO corporate.
