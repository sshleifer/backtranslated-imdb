"Who loves the sun" works its way through some prickly subject with enough joke and grace to keep the story not only engaging, but often hilarious. It's been a while since I've found such a thoroughly touching, thoroughly enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, draws the eye with beautiful scenery and quiet landscapes. The peaceful art contrasts wonderfully with the excitement between the very human, very flawed and yet very sympathetic characters. Because of the excellent cast, all five of the big players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun." It's a really fun movie that takes a fateful look at the evil we can inflict on each other and the incredibly difficult, yet equally rewarding, forgiveness process.
