Cutting for the Hunt: This is one of the most amazing, most intense movies I've seen for a long time. The first film this year left me completely offset. I could hardly feel out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes and trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie and just failing. Highlighting every aspect of it - the documentary format, the unclear depiction of the events, the power of character - seems to just trivialize everything. Some may find it ridiculous that any killer could be characterized as normal. But then not all murderers rage lunatics frothy at the mouth. Many are quite regular, modest people. They are just differently connected. <br /> <br /> And that's perhaps the most chilling way of thinking for everyone.
