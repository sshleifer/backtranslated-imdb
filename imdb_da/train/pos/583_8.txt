In a small town in Montana, two brothers are growing up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is reverend Maclean, and they grow up with their lessons related to religion and the lessons of fly fishing. In this movie fly fishing represents life a little. The story is good and keeps you alert, though there are some moments you need a little action. The movie probably has these moments because it's not about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things do happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years, he returns and becomes involved in a nice girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has become a reporter and is known as a "fisherman's reporter". He is famous and thinks he has a good life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well tuned, it has a good score and all the players are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography. The mountains, the forest and the river all look very beautiful. If the movie was only made for these things, it was good enough to see. Fortunately, there is more.
