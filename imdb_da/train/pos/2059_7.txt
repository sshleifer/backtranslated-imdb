What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and scarecrow is a clear and original. He really brought me back to the monsters in the 80s. Of course, the budget is low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lens, but it doesn't matter because it never takes itself seriously. From the trailer's rubbish bin redneck to the high flying martial arts moving scarecrow, this is really a b-movie gem. Take some refreshments, snacks and a few friends and save back and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much I went out and bought all 3 Scarecrow movies. Sure, they are not for everyone, but for each their own. Sometimes you just have to put the thought hat down and smile.
