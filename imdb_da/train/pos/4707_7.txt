"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit and miss comedy that has it laughing and "huh?". But I suggest giving it a try. I think it is very overlooked. Not too many people give this movie a chance. It works. Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very fun in his role. And he does well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He works right up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife. And of course, like a lot of mob movies, someone will have him dead. 90% of the jokes get a laugh. As I said, I said a chance. Just take your favortie gangster movie and mix a comedy in. You got "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
