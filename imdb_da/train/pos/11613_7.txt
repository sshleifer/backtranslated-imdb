Distortion is a movie that kind of surprised me. A kind of multi-stored drama that focuses on a man who writes a game about his life experiences that happens to him right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is cheating him so that he hires a private eye to snoop on him. His wife has no idea this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play have also got a number of whoopdedoodles up on the sleeves by fooling around with each other and with us we must say unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. It all culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable (but not really) happening. <br /> <br /> The director of the play really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that reminds you, this is a funny movie indeed, one that I didn't mind to see and would recommend people check out.
