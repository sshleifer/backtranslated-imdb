I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I remembered forever the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I realized the time how much a people can hardly be presented and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship with friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, the grown-up between people who share everyday life, who see each other face, who knows each other names but belongs to different worlds, can only do appear. So, at the most critical moments, a worrying question arises: "Who do we first have to be loyal to?" What people, family, motherland, the person you know close to you? You have no time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with the victims of themselves. Somewhere a problem remains unresolved, the feeling grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, for this death, this unique vanishing life I lived there , I shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was lived by the spectator I was. That day I solve Gunga-Din forever. As I left later, my beautiful childhood, which I left from then, was so many worlds I lived in. I left everything too good, and these lines are a short visit today, I didn't expect to do this morning when I arrived up.
