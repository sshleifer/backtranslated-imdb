I found this movie to be charming. I thought the characters were developed when I looked, I found myself caring about these people. This is a period that I think took place during depression. A single mother, known as the city's alien (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the paper for "a man". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-con that happens in the city looking for work. He sees the advertisement and he goes out to see her. She hires him. I really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because I found it easy to put in their shoes. Everything went so much. He needs the work so he won't disturb her. And she needs her help but doesn't want him to get the upper hand. They dance that they really need each other. Things start warming up until ...... the big blowup. I won't spoil it by telling you what's happening. But the point of decision is absolutely wonderful. I found the story to be very credible for the time it takes. I think this is one of the better "relationships" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation won't "get it," but if you're over 40, I think you like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time," you'll also like him in this one too.
