Not really a big box office draw, but I was pleasently surprised <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I did some things for Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> co-wrote and directed this movie about a regular, average guy <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would have been <br /> <br /> incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game <br /> <br /> when he was 15. But thanks to mystical and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry gets his wish, but soon realizes that his new life is not exactly what he hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have given <br /> <br /> it mixed, and I have to say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> pulled out well. Yes, it is a small standard, but packs enough <br /> <br /> fun moments, drama and great plays to do it really well. James Belushi (I think) was worthy of Oscar's role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It is <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen, I <br /> <br /> strongly recommend you to check
