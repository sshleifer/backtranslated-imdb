Love is overwhelming ... In all, it is manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely fantastic ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story of love in all its forms, a story of the undecipherable ways of young hearts , about life and lost innocence, all of which are directed by Tudor Giurgiu's talented eye. With a magnificent soundtrack with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises in every way to leave the taste of misunderstanding love ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or is Romanian filmography slow but surely forward and respectful? This is a brilliant movie ... Two thumbs up to everyone involved.
