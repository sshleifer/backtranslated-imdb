Okay. This has been a favorite since I was 14. Allowed, I don't see it several times a year anymore, but ... This is not an older generation movie that wants a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's pretty dated, almost pass, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to be charmed by a 90's breakfast at Tiffany's, attended the 90's raves, or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't bother.
