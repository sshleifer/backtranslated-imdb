If the creators of this movie had made any attempt to introduce reality to the plot, it would have been just a waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, they have created a comic marvel by throwing all the achievements of reality into the winds. Who could pass a movie where a foreign pilot uses the entire movie as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers T-shirt. Do not reject this movie as a bin.
