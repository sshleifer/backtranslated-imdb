For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz buff. There is an exhibition that runs until the end of June in Paris' brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, which is called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which one should not miss. With special entertainment, nine excerpts of jazz film, including PHANTOM LADY's famous drum sequence. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their movie appearances and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr. was DUBBED in the movie. It was some progress when he was killed in most of his other performances (mainly in the Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa probably called Cook in PL. I could recognize his style when he had already graduated from the empty tom, which was used (and abused) at the beginning of his career - in the 1937 Hollywood HOTEL's SING, SING, SING sequence - and eventually got everything possible from what we call in French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence from PL, at least as shown in the museum, is not censored. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
