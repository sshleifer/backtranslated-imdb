It is refreshing to watch a movie that you think will end happily like almost any other American movie, and so surprised when it doesn't. I like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it is better to portray things in a more realistic way and I thought Brokedown Palace did very well. The ending with a friend basically sacrificing himself for the other and thus releasing his previous bad behavior, which made them get into the situation in the first place, moved a lot. I'd rather have done without the last line, which turned out she didn't actually do the act she confessed, for it would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime. Whether she did it or not, it wasn't that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself borders on the clich√©, but the actors kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
