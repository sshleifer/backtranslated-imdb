The film took a new angle on Gandhi's life, which is nice to see, and it shows how man he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was disturbed by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big grip is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too lukewarm, and he seemed to be deliberately portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and used only to show the time frame and general setting of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall great movie if you remember it's not a complete picture.
