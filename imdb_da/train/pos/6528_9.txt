I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was completely into it. I love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. It's great set design. The scenes really look like they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so beautiful. I rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * Pre-spoilers * <br /> <br /> Documentary tells of amazing blues men, with black and white old-fashioned scenes by the black man playing guitar and song. It's really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands, and that is perhaps one thing I might not like in this documentary. It is the abundant use of connections to modern rock bands that play these Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really understand their broken way of playing such amazing blues songs. This is the same kind of unmatched musical taste I found when I saw Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary film was such a standing ovation at this first screening in the small cinema that the next day, this documentary was shown to all and normal tourists on the Croisette beach at the outdoor cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy the thousands of people sitting in the sand at night.
