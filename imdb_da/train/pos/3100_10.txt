At the end of the first hour, my jaw was nested comfortably between my feet. The film never, and I never mean, lets up in action. It can be mild action, but it is action. Once again, each member of the casting fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, chase scenes were possible, and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne. All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie is getting better and that is no exception. The action, the action, the plot. How they do it, I will never know. I welcome the man who wrote the screen to each of these films. Because if he hadn't done a good job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about. <br /> <br /> So don't watch it in theaters, experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not December 11, Bourne comes home to you!
