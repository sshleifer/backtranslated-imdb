Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility that I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed she wanted to handle the situation, but she was under her husband's dominance. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duval's character, Joe, strongly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with the death of an accident by a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy", meaning he was so confused and overwhelmed by what he did, he was emotionally paralyzed. So to the end, when Jason Pressons character, Arnold, left everything to a stranger, I was so crushed for him that I actually thought of some of the terrible things I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest and Gail Young's roles did NOT add much to the movie. I was thinking of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, female brother Andy, like a dunk that did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Young's, appeared as a crazy lady who crumbled Arnold out of frustration with her own problems without shame and blamed him for her problems. I couldn't really be sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she failed. Both did not deal effectively with their problems. They really did nothing for the movie and were absolutely ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as grandfather was touching that he was the only person who showed Arnold any attention. I felt that his role should have been elaborated. The players did just what they felt was adequate and adequate. But I really liked the end so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. Hillerman's was a family again. I would actually be part of this family. They were so realistic.
