The man in the moon is a warm and moving commercial drama centered around an agricultural family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops an infatuation with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling to her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy changes this family's dynamics for forever. The 1950s have been lovingly developed here, and the manuscript gives you characters you will care about almost immediately. Witherspoon is already starting to show the Oscar-winning talent she wanted to develop in this early role, and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield gives a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister who is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that discovers strong feelings and gives deeper meaning to the term "family ties".
