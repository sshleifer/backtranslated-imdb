"The mother" tells of a recent widow in the midst of a 60-year-old mother of two adult children (Reid), who in her husband's death discovers from a sleepwalking life as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover . The film lives on the quiet passive mother, her unpleasant relationship with her adult son and daughter, the silent need she tries to reassure herself in bed with her young lover and the resulting transitions. A somewhat antiseptic drama with appalling psychodramatic undercurrents, "The Mother" does an excellent job of handling unpleasant problems realistically while avoiding free sensationism. Will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women who can better empathize with the central character, her needs and problems. (B +)
