Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but that is a very different story, and while Angela is lovely, she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews. That said, Lansbury is the perfect cast and delivers a magical performance. There is something nice about her character and she gets wonderful support from David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a tune, but he is certainly not very chopped as a singer. It doesn't matter that he was such a gifted actor you almost didn't notice. There are some amazing cameos from much-loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel, who gives a winning performance and the much-loved Tessie OShea, who does very little, but it's great to see the old gal again. It's also great to see Sam Jaffe and King of English TV Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The result has a couple of beautiful songs, especially The Briny Sea and The Age of Not Believing. The great number Portabello Road is stretched to the border, but it has lots of theatricality. The effects look a bit clich√© today, but the scene with the German attackers being attacked by the wildest army in movies is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies, but you struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the domestic army's marching song. The housekeeper was very important to the UK and this is a warm tribute. The animation is lovely, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. A warm happy movie and its weird it's not done on stage.
