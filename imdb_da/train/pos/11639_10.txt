I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was very scary in this movie. He played his character very well. The scariest "bad guy" I've seen for a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, slipped and cheered at the same time, as if we were cue. The tension is kept through the film. The amazing part is that the ending was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the film's justice. The film is much better than the listed trailer. Don't wait for this movie to come out on video. Go see it. Although I didn't have to pay to watch this movie, I'd like to give 10.75 to watch it. Enjoy!
