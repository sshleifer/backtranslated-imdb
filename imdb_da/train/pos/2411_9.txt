This film finds me one of the most successful attempts to come up with reasonable answers to some of the insidious questions that have slashed in the recent scholarship of Christ's suffering and suffering in the New Testament. (What motivated Judas if money was not the issue? What could Sanhedrin meet on a holiday? Why was Pilate's waffle?) It is a film for the serious, thinking Christian: fans of "Christ's passion" will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory plays and arch characterization. For myself, I find the portrait painted here - about the will of ordinary people to so plainly sacrifice common decency when their own self-interest is at stake - far more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The uninterested, "just doing my job" look at the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ's wrist, is as chilling as a moment in film.) The film does not claim "authenticity" but the settings and costuming feel always more "right" than many more highly recognized bets. It's a slow movie, but if you accept its self-imposed limits (after all, it's "death" - not life - "of Christ"), ultimately a very rewarding one.
