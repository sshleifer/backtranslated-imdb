This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, who played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker for his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay between these major roles has been enhanced by a fantastic backing of well-known character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feel-gooder"! Hearty recommendations.
