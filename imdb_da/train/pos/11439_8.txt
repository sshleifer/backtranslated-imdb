OK - as far as the 2 versions of this movie are concerned. There were 2 people involved in making - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really had no form to say it in the movie - just helped with money) - The "Adult" version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to the Ladd movie that went under, they did not announce this movie and threw all their advertising cash for "The Right Stuff" and hoped it would pull them through; And it didn't. So this movie has never had a chance. When "Twice" made it cable (HBO) - they showed the wheels with Bill's version, and John threatened to sue if it was shown more (did you notice how the "adult" version was not for too long?). Showtime has the 'clean' version. The version on the video tape and laser disc is the version approved by John (which has more power than Bill). It's a shame, really, because the "adult" version is actually better and makes it more sensible. But it is very doubtful that it will ever be released in the version on DVD (or any other format that is not bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information that I used to be president of Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (still has many things from the movie - used to own a letter version of the "adult" version, but it was stolen - only has a partial HBO copy of it now). 8 stars for "adult" version - 5 for "clean" version. Any other questions, just ask.
