I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I suppose she is the kind of actress who has better not acted before the camera, but just be herself. She did, and she looked naturally in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so she looked more like a sober editor. In the second half she sat back in her daily track, and I just couldn't tell her to be an editor in any way. Therefore, her performance is not enduring in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is appealing and inspiring. Young's character is full and reasonable. Still, the film tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big mistake is that it didn't show a turning point for the hero and heroine's love story. I am completely confused when they kiss at the end of history, because it is pretty unclear to the two people.
