The British horror movie was in terminal decline in the early seventies, but out of the range came three films that were among the best our island produced. Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House, who killed blood, made the future seem rosy, although many people knew at this time there was not one. The THTDB has the kind of molding that could easily form a wish list, if it had not been assembled in the gloomy hinterland in 2008, you might find yourself expecting to wake up. Vokverk is most overlooked by the four stories and is, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are interconnected so firmly that you cannot tell where the performance ends and pain begins. One can only guess how this role hit such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and the girl. RIP Peter.
