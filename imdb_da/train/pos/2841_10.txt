As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you with very high expectations. I happily went out with all my expectations met. It was fun, sweet, fast and entertaining. The movie starts with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. It was fun, and then the movie goes into some of the best sketches I've ever seen anywhere. There were four fantastic out of all the good ones. The four I will start talking about. One has Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop in a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next has Orlando Bloom as a music producer doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another contains Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character is disabled. The best one has Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I would like to point out that Nataile Portman makes an impressive direct debut director and writes a shit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirtatious man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is absolutely as good if not better than 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The sketches are paced and the film shows how the movie actually should be. However, the film does not have as many well-known directors as Paris Je'Taime, so it was great to live up to its expertise. If you want to laugh, see some amazing dramatic effects, watch a great amount of great shows, and just be entertained, then definitely see New York, I love you.
