Okay, it was a pretty sensitive little number, but I can't help but think I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA movie I watched poetry called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE". Also had stains of "Welcome to Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in its execution. It is not to say that they are not tasteful references ... just that they feel very modern and very modern ... which makes me feel that this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and history) than the work of an original and authentic author to come. <br /> <br /> The camera is just ... perfect for my taste. For coral filter (or charcoal) for my taste ... too built-in framed 12mm. Therefore, the whole impression gave me a little distant - beware of art that preaches itself too easily! The French (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy what the jury did ... but the Cannes short film committee is notoriously conservative in terms of its job selection, although I wonder what has been in the last few years.
