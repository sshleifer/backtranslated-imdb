If you love cult 70's Sci-fi, I have to do it or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" than you will love this one. It is a stream of consciousness 70's sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century foam and the earth a million years from now. This movie is pure 70s. Set on Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon" and you're ready to go!
