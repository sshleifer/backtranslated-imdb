This ensemble piece about adults returning to their youth-formal summer camp was a very quiet actor and engaged in cinemas in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but then again some of the better films ARE make publications that do not get a lot of hype or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin well here) are the group of actors who train these roles as people, who have grown old with good, bad and funny memories of summers that have passed. This movie covers gambitic feelings, mostly pleasurable, and the movie will never look at the viewer to feel what the characters feel and prefer to let the viewer get into the memories alone. Since I am a filmmaker who is bristled in bluntly, brazen manipulation in movies, it is something I appreciate from author / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good cheap rental, a good rental and even a beautiful sitting in a theater girl. You can run across this on TV and I would definitely suggest a look-see.
