SERIES THREE-BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before starting" Hot on the heels of the second series, showing the show back with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to Prince Regent, a vain and silly foil for Blackadder's venom, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still like the second piece of comic puzzle. The format resembles the previous show, after all they had found the winning formula why change things. We see that Blackadder is trying to get rich out of the happy regent's back in many more brilliant ways, trying to turn Bladrick into an M.P.or attempting to awaken an appropriate break to the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate of the series historically the regent's ruler took control of the throne under his fathers because of madness and some of the characters that resembled much of the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all go through the events and everyone manages to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a star cast
