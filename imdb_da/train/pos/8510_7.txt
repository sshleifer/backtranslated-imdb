This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler movie and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from film and was to die the following year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine continues without him perfectly, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the screens often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't just Whistler himself hanging it all on the screen, Dix did as well. <br /> <br /> Young couples who step out for a fortnight get the urge to marry slope rain, but are faced when the potential bride first disappears, then it is already being married before she appears to be angry. Is the potential groom off, even when the private cock he is employed to find her suddenly swallows him and the lamb, or is love blind? Who is turning who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate movie is ok, if a bit of a glimpse, lovely Lenore Auber's finest moments came the next movie in Abbott & Costello. Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on the Boston Blackie loan. Also, the only excursion where Whistler himself must have been wet from towing in the rain, unless he was sprayed with sea foam in Voice. <br /> <br /> Much happened in this last hour, worth looking at and again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series began in 1942, continued until 1955, when nearly 700 half-hour shows were set up, almost all of which are available on mp3 and based on what I have heard so far, where almost everyone is also worth listening to.
