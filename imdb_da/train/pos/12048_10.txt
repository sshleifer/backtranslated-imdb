How much could the general Hollywood instructor learn from this movie? Everyone ... when it comes to actually scary people. These movies really show that it is possible to really scare and scare a viewer, and that monstrous monsters and long knives will never be the best way to achieve this. Anyone who loves a real psychological thriller must see this movie ... it's the best of that kind.
