"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I might have thought I'd give the sequel a chance and I did. The Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and had a good laugh and fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem I sometimes feel is that there is no need for explanations because they can make plot holes and just a sense of having your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie to Lion King fans or just one night with the family. It's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. So hopefully I get the same with the third installment for the Lion King series. Sit back and just think of Hakuna Matata! That means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
