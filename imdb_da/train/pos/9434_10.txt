I remember watching this movie on TV some years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and over rated. I decided to revisit it last night to see if I had missed something the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing movies all the time, and it has clearly had a big impact on movies today and will probably last forever. I can't believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds are performing in their careers and supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you a sense of disgust and fear long after you've seen it, it's really terrible. Oh, and I mention that the theme song is also good? Well it is, and this movie must be seen by movie fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this movie for the experience. Just don't expect a picnic.
