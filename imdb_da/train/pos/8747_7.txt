* Possible Spoilers * Although it's done before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return to Paradise', Brokedown Palace still strikes a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls traveling through Thailand and being arrested for drug trafficking. Was it Clare Danes' Alice? Was it Kate Beckinsales Darlene? Was it the beautiful stranger they met on their journey? None of that really matters, because this is a story of friendship and trust and the boundaries they can stretch. Throw Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and better lawyer than he is), and we have a nice little story that keeps the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for some reason - it's not an original concept, it doesn't show sensationalized violence that causes the wannabe avant-garde crowd to talk about it "cruel realism" or "badly hit truths" - it's just a good story with some fine ideas. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy features and cruel way of talking. I was totally sorry about the character. <br /> <br /> While being decent, Kate Beckinsale is nothing spectacular. She works well, but it is not exactly a memorable achievement. <br /> <br /> However, Jacqueline Kim has a good shape and creates a sympathetic and defined character where there is really not much work to do. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake - this is Clare Danes' movie. I have long been a fan of her work and that is no change. She catches in every scene she looks, and if it wasn't for her, the movie would probably get into boring fare. I particularly welcome her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
