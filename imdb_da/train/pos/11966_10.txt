This is an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares for each other and helps each other through their crisis sets a good example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do and a number of bad choices, but they never turn their backs on the family they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the sweetest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family it is better. DJ, the oldest daughter, grows up whether her father wants it to happen or not. One thing they all share is they miss their mother. Danny (father), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much, and that is evident in every episode.
