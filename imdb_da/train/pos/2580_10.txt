I say the domino principle is a huge underappreciated movie. Anyone who has taken the time to examine our contemporary story of conspiracy; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact many others can only conclude that the author of the domino really knew what he was talking about. Roy Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sir Gordon or Arthur Bremer maybe even John Hinkley or Timothy Mcveigh. To mention a couple. The association scenarios involve spies, large corporations, and political murders are not really a fiction, but a vicious part of our terrible existence history. Help us, but the domino principle is more factual than imagination. If it causes a slight loss of sleep, it may not take my word for it, examine for yourself.
