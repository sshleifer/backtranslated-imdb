I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He was and is the greatest of all times. A few days ago, a friend gave me a gift. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just couldn't believe it! So I took my time and watched the movie again. After many years, it kicked me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but of the good old times I remembered back when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a child. You can really see the parody Michael went through his life. Thanks Michael Jackson for bringing me back to the great times, for your great music and dancing. It's a shame that people have forgotten you .. I didn't because you gave me good moments with your music. All the best for you where ever you are out there ..
