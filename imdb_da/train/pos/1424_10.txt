Rather annoying that reviewers compare this with Planet Earth ... Of course * Planet Earth is better - it has much more of the same. The Earth is like an expanded trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it's not like comparing it to similar. As a document length with document length (or as a feature length somewhat), it largely surpasses everything you want to see throughout your life (unless you choose to cross the ground in long-distance helicopters and wait for months in the most extreme environment to get a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on the ground, which - let's face it - is unlikely). <br /> <br /> On the story: yes everyone in the UK - very much including me - separates David Attenborough and there is little excuse for him not to tell here, but it hardly deserves to hit a star or down . He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he is modest and gracious enough to realize that everything that gets more viewers in is a good thing. Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by his awe, majesty, and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love it (ie all) will / should continue to see a purchase Planet Earth. Saw three bowls for his cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on DVD instead of the Planet Earth box. But as works of art they are not in competition here people. The soil is big enough for both.
