"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library; Disney reminded it in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as the team (Disney used to own this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team; also good use of the words, huh ?????). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a couple of orphans who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, only if the angels won the vimp. So he called God one night about this. The boy who prayed could see the help coming (and only that boy); For example, when the first angel had come down, a player hit a ball so hard, not only did the bats collapse, it also made the ball !!!!! For much of the 1994 post-All Star season, the angels were at the top of AL West (of which my homework Rangers are one and it is still). But they lost a game because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (there was no Central Division in Baseball then when Chicago was in the West) and no angels were there to help. Thus, a new rule was created: no angels can help in championship games. But wait! In the final championship game, the angels won !!!!! It was truly a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the last few years and asked for help with school and things; look at me now! My work was good !!!!! So for one, this shows that if you believe God can send down his angels to help you with any problems you may have in life. And secondly, it's a family baseball movie that is always exciting. This is also an old Disney movie; I've seen this just recently on the New Disney Channel (Blech !!!!!). "Angels in the Outfield" will change your life forever once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
