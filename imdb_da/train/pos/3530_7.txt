I can surely admit (as an IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never break into my movie noir top twenty. It can't even sneak into the top fifty. But rather than discrediting the movie for not being as good as so many other classics in the film noir genre, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and durable images in it to make it a worthy display. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to overcome the terrible, slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie does not get cooking until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) sets out to prove everything but only the guilt of innocence, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary of the day and amateur detective at night. As a novice sleuth, she does it well for herself while working on the streets of New York at night. Gradually, she begins to put pieces of a mystery puzzle together. To be honest, the movie belongs to Raines, and it is only because of her presence that the movie works well. Somehow, she is able to breathe in a film about a condemned man who is not interesting at least. I'm not sure if this shattered dynamics of a characterless leading man becomes the actor's or instructor's fault, but it is clear that something will be terribly wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is As a beginner detective, things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'Kansas' pays a sennat visit to a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of some information to help her condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the city a new kind of red while visiting the jazz clubs "all night". Trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet, it can destroy the scene all of it. You know the scene when the last cymbal crash finishes ringing. If you're lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you'll probably revive this scene over and over again. Almost Raines is, this scene makes this movie remarkable. It is primarily because of this scene that I judge 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of a 6. <br /> <br /> Mostly, this movie comes out as weak and bland with a few amazing scenes and a magnificent scene. It is the "drum / sex scene" that separates this movie from others of the same ilk. <br /> <br /> And, as the film says, "you never go wrong with Vanilla", I would also add that "vanilla" is the safe fall back choice when you can't decide to have a taster treat. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
