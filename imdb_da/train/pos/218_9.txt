Surviving roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns, playing a couple of old vaudeville cartoons, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seem to have a different outlook on life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin find less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What made him bad was that some 15 years earlier, his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can't understand it and take Burns's decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits the brainworm, reunite the guys and do it on a national television special. What happens here is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story and about old age. Matthau is on the screen for most of the movie, but it is Burns who got kudos in the form of an Oscar at the age of 79 years. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a bit of personality to this movie as well. As we all know, he was the right man of the wonderful comedy team of Burns & Allen, whom the Monty Python squad lent much to. In 1958 due to health reasons, Gracie Allen withdrew, and George continued to go up to 100 years. Or at least pretty close as an active performer. The Sunshine Boys are based on the Smith & Dale team, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I highly recommend watching Two Tickets to Broadway for a look at a couple of guys entertaining the US public at the end the last century. The doctor outlines that Matthau and Burns are direct from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like The Sunshine Boys.
