And this is me. And not just me, as I can see here on IMDb or when you leave the theater. Why did people love it? It's obvious: Everyone knows zombies now (at least the Horror fans of the heart and the others through "The Dawn of the Dead" reinvention or Resident Evil movies, etc.) Or at least they thought they knew it all about zombies ... it's until this movie came together. And you can see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, even though it contains some violent scenes, but is rather a comedy. A satire to be precise. And it never runs out of steam! That's why I rated it so high. Pacing wise it is incredible, the play is amazing and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... on the contrary: It's a gem and if you're only interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you don't like them, see it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
