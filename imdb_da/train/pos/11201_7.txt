Surprisingly good early efforts by Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original screenshots written by Hitchcock himself, shows this film's remarkable story structure. It starts with a bursting boxing battle where carnival champion "One Round" Jack loses a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter. The movie then lowers to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the movie is a dramatic build up of the rematch between the two men, this time for the grave crown. Even in this early movie, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and proposition. A bracelet bought for the girl by the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major critic of this movie is that the art of filming a boxing match had not been perfected in 1927. As a result, the final battle becomes a bit anti-climatic. The story, however, is what carries this film through.
