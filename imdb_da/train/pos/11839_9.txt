This movie was very entertaining. The sound track (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams also making all songs in French. The result is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is made from a blend of traditional animation combined with computer-generated images. The result is really amazing. I watch this movie with my kids at least once a week, and we never need it. The story is convincing and well told. <br /> <br /> I don't understand anyone who would rate this movie less than a 7. Definitely a keeper in my household.
