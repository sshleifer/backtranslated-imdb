This video rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does he have class, he does some of the funniest observations about the history and culture I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and most intelligent cartoon I've seen for a long time. Tell all the other stand-ups to get out of the scene and let this "executive" rule!
