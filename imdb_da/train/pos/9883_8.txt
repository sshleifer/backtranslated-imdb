It ran for 8 seasons, but it was not until the beginning of 1959, and it was late, autumn 1965, shorter than the 2-7 season. CBS boss William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after seeing the first edition of season 8 in September 1965 because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had gone after season 7. The latest episode was sent in November 1965. The lone 1966 CBS broadcast, January 4, 1966, was a recycling. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered why Rawhide doesn't change to color film for the last season? Most of the major western 1960s had turned into color in 1965. In the fall, CBS issued the color of the fall for many of their sitcoms, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last Western (and last prime time series to change color) on September 17, 1966 for the Snap Decision episode.
