One of the things about the movie that warms my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a big part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my dry fly fishing, have tied my own flies and accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend a day on a river or another seeking to tempt the eternally disturbing trout to rise and fly offered them. <br /> <br /> As we had occasions like this, any difference between us disappeared and any of the world's printers melted away to be replaced by the glory absorbed in the activity and surroundings of the place we were in This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the movie when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. Because there is something ritualistic about fly fishing, as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You can't just start casting your fishing line and hoping for the best. You need to get yourself the place you are in, you need to scan the surface of the water considering how it flows, and where the best point can be to place your fly and depending on your skill level, you can even get yours Fly to shore long enough for a fish to record it and strike. The "bird of flight" was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie couldn't be chosen more appropriately, because the river actually ran through the lives of the father and two sons. However, this film is spread more widely than the family and community in Montana, at the Blackfoot River, where the movie is being played. It has the ability to pull you in to regret you, to catch you, as the family history, community and period unfold. The story told is not just a family story, but a story of life. What can be classified as a 'River of Life'
