Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so eagerly, I was prepared to be disappointed with Joseph Strick's and Fred Haines' manuscript in light of the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film proved to be very well done and a fine translation of the book's tone, naturalism and life. It definitely helps to read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine that the latter seems to be heterogeneous, with very uneven episodes seemingly stuck randomly, without a prior reading of the text to help understand the plot. It is great to see how "dirty" the movie is when it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors eventually did not finish to see the regular audience in Ireland as late as 2000 (it was shown to limit the audience in a private cinema club, the Irish movie theater, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not just naturalistic and raunchy, it gives many game "perverse" episodes. Remember that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was released in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was made in 1967. It is amazing and encouraging to see the cream of Irish plays from the 1960s, respected players all, who are bold to pronounce and introduce Joyce's hugely transgressive text with such a gusto. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
