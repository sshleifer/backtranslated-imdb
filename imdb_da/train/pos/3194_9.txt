There has never been anything like it that is safe. This episodic, apparently superfluous trilogy is only really sensible as a whole, and as such, it's not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, Utah's cross-dressing sensation. It is very self-conscious about a film about how the filmmaker responds to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an expanded and spectacular disturbance of guilt and repentance. He tries to sue for his sins - yes, Gary tried suicide after the original doctor was sent - through correction, comment, and convention, to regain such Hollywood narrative as the best friend and the incredible happy end (two different with one narrative adjustment in the Glover version) and make them their own personal applications. So even though thematically it remains a film about gender and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies - but at an almost unprecedented level of complexity. There is just as much going on; Harris is in the right place three times in a row in the narrative and narrative of this story, and he does not miss the opportunity to do anything about it. Infinitely moves, and as profound as the camp ever gets.
