Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie in the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has what Harry was told to have a holiday after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable "Make My Day" Capture comes from!) But the city he took a vacation was worse , a woman became vigilante after a rape attack in a fun and starts getting the dots one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer, which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in Terminator. Worth to see if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or similar action criminal thrillers.
