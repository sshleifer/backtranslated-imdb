I am currently filming A.S level movies and "this is not a love song" is a movie we watched, and in my opinion, it is a very simple story movie but a complex back story. If you scratch the surface, you'll find a thriller-chase movie of two men running through the countryside from the farmers after committing a murder: - "sounds quite exciting". <br /> <br /> But you have to dig deeper to uncover the true sense of the true genre. As suggested, it is a love story between two gay lovers, full of confidence, fraud and fraud. We are not told of this "love" directly through the film, but the events that happen through, for example, the way Heaton is acting against Spike, almost frighten this untouched love affair in our faces. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a good example of why British movies should not be dismissed as "waste" just because they are made on a low budget. A good movie with a complicated storyline, but it is definitely an acquired taste and may not be suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
