He-he-hey !! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun lovin ', independent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Together with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish supplier. It's an upcoming age story for the new adults looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers who may feel that their only skills are able to maintain while hammered and necked to throw good parties. On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie fantastic. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all her movies. There are subtle manners that perfected its character. If you want good laugh and a fun time, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
