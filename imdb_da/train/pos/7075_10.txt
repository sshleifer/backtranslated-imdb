Time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underhanded minds. They are fun to consider in a 'what if?' kind of way. Filmmakers and writers have repeatedly dealt with a large selection of films and TVs, including 'Star Trek: First Contact', 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and Stargate SG1 tribute , 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinline's "All You Zombies" was written decades ago and yet it will still spin people who read the short story for the first time. In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent movie, '12 Monkeys', it is difficult to determine what may be continuity problems with plural elements intended to make us rethink our notion of the film. Repeated views will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> For the first time, some watching the movie will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the continuing interruption of experience" visited on him by time travel. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other time-traveling stories, '12 Monkeys' unclear about future history can be changed by manipulating past events. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that time cannot be changed, but a phone call from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he returned to 1996 in his own personal timeline. <Br /> <br /> Even this could be interpreted as an event that would happen in a single timeline universe to ensure that the timeline is not changed ... Cole must die within the eyes of his younger even for fate to be realized. If so, the time is like a liquid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces working on it. It scares the mind to dwell on this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that then control the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we board the plane at the end of the movie, that means the future can change by manipulating past events ... or doing so? The film has probably led to lots of drunk fights in pillars occupied by physicists and mathematicians
