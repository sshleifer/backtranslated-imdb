Although I'm not the biggest fan of wirework-based martial arts movies, when a movie goes straight after fantasy rather than fighting, I get a lot more fun out of it, and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plotting and crazy flight antics. Ching Siu Tung has created here an enchanting treat with good performance and very ethereal beauty. The big, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a treasure trove that holds the night in a haunted temple and gets involved in an impressive fox and a crazy taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma is gratifying the wall as the Taoist monk showing some sword and even getting a musical number. Perhaps best of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, really a pleasure to see with every move and gesture seductively seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all touched together in a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Heavy, steering and handling choreography gives some nice wirework tensions and fills the movie with fog, shadows and scary enchanting foam colors, giving each forest scene a wonderfully breathtaking atmosphere. Also noteworthy are the elaborate hair styling and the beautiful flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I am not mistaken, Joey Wang sometimes has sports hair as a fox-bearer, a wonderful touch. Though the movie has relatively little action and some maybe scary cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful entertainment image with swells and plotting, even the odd nice arch, a nearly constant supply of visual treats and ample dreamy atmosphere. An essential treasure, highly recommended.
