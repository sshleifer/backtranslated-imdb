*** SPOILERS *** When undercover Brooklyn North It. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, was going to meet his drug supplier, Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg part of Brooklyn in a buying and bus operation, where Tito is the one who is busted that things went haywire with both. Santos and Tito end up being shot and killed by each other. During the deadly lap, an innocent criminal also killed six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, in the crossfire. <br /> <br /> With the New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer the last thing that the city's flamboyant mayor Pappas, Al Pacino wanted, was a possible rebellion over the young James Bone's tragic death By one possible, it was later established that it was a bullet from Tito's weapon that killed young James, a member of the New York City Police Department. What was far more shocking, even Bone's death is that his murderer Tito Zapatti was given a trial by the reputable NY State judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the back seat of his car! It soon became clear that the person who got Judge Stern's job for a payout of $ 50,000 was not the second political politician in Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved with Mayor Pappas in a country deal involving the New York Subway System that would bring him and his estate agents friends tens of thousands of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect the mayor's papers in the bone's killing by connecting him with Judge Stern, which allowed Tito to be free, who is a common friend to both him and his Gomba or Landman, Frank Anselmo! <br /> <br /> To keep all this from blowing up late. Santons is framed by working undercover without authority from his superiors, in Bone shooting. In fact, the framed Santos goes so far and hides some $ 40,000 in cash in his upstate summer home, making it payable by Tito's Uncle Mafia chief Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal with drugs with him. Get a piece of the action. Who can explain to him, as well as Tito, is being shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos! As it turns out, Mayor Pappas' deputy in the city hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up brass up for his boss by being too honest to find who was responsible for covering Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the street. The facts revealed by Kevin lead directly to Frank Anselmo, a great political supporter of mayor Pappas, who, as it turned out, was associated with hip to Tito's mafia chief, Uncle Paul! <br /> <br /> Slightly overflowing "City Hall" shows how great urban corruption can filter up and down to everyone in the city's government without them, just like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappa's greatest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo, who put people in jobs, like Judge Stern, who was dismissed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to get it started, not just by Tito, beyond that. Santos and James Bone were killed, but why he was allowed to be out in the street to bring down the very popular New York City mayor. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much larger things, as governor or even president, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out, his top substitute Kevin Calhoun was in not seeing the other way responsible for his death. As well as the mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person he helped put on the bench as a judge, Judge Stern. Who has decided to let Tito Zapatti turn off this disaster, resulting in at least half a dozen murders and a suicide!
