I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. Liam Neeson plays the same spirit to the role he brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a really good job as his wife Maria. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person who is very likely to crawl your skin. <br /> <br /> All in all, this comes out as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood released two films almost backwards by taking a swipe in England. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
