White fire has so much to do for it. With Larry Bird look-like Robert Ginty leading the charge glowing away with his amazing hair and super macho mustache, the movie goes over other low budget actions. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With Ginty beating everyone up, the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond-intruding goes into play. Then add in Fred Williamson, some frontal shrubs, chainsaw attacks and some amazing incest themes .... this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders. If you're looking for some amazing B-Action, this is where it is. Now, if I can just get my hands on that soundtrack.
