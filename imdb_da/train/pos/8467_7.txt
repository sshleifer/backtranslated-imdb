I liked this movie because it pretty much did more with less. It could have been more interesting if they had kept it limited to the study even more (although some of the plate elements would have been more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy who played the DJ did a good job showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories. I also found his dialogue with the caller quite fun. <br /> <br /> While parts of the movie may come a mile away, other parts you won't expect to turn out like they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrating more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done when everything was revealed. <br /> <br /> While it was a shorter movie, it felt almost the right time to tell the story. Something more and it would have started to pull.
