A long-awaited film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of rest Rajini has acted in this film. The hype for this movie was toooooo high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this movie he also gives some spiritual messages. But it also contains typical Rajini actions, style, songs, etc. It is a good entertaining movie and also provides good messages. <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the manuscript. It's a must see movie. Do not miss it!
