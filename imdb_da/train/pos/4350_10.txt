This movie is one of those that has a resounding knowledge of it. It's grounded, grounded and a movie that makes you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and appropriate; And the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. This certainly deserves recognition for both the movie and the actors! Finally, a work of art that differs from the obvious love story and the frequent special influences seen today. Never have I gone from a movie with such deep warmth and emotional feeling in my heart; because it felt like someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece rug. To see this movie is to find a real treasure and joy in it.
