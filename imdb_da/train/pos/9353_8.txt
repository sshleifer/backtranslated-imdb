REIGN OVER MIG (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. Occasionally, at times, mediocre dramedy affects a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love"), winning again with his old college roommate and friend (Cheadle continues to do impressive work with every role to date), a well-functioning dentist who seems to have it all ?? family, wealth, happiness ?? but really sees an ally in freedom with the personal sacrifice of his troubled friend. Written and directed by Binder (as co-stars as Sandler's former best friend and actor) with equal sharing of humor and true heartache, the film works best when the two stars divide the screen until the last action falls into an almost movie-week troll to clear a solution to the current conditions.
