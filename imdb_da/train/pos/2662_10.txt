* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start this, let me say that I have had both benefits of watching this movie on the big screen and having seen the "authorized version" of this movie, as Stephen King himself made in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both benefits made me appreciate this version of "The Shining", the more. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I have read Mr. King's book "The Shining" on many occasions over the years and while I love the book and is a big fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's story of this story is far more convincing ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to transfer the psychic terror directly to movies. In the direction of the film AND the actual script of the manuscript itself he acquired the title "Magus" in addition to the question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The film industry lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other excellent credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. Torrences (Jack, Wendy's wife and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been employed as a caretaker. It's his job to monitor the upkeep of the hotel over the many months of hard snow until spring, when Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many wealthy and rugged tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snowy summer vacation. The hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It was next to the atmosphere by having a dark, yet "welcoming" atmosphere, though. The furniture and furniture were all the time (late 70s - early 80s), and the cinematography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you overlook the approximation, but also in your mind right where deserted and isolated hotel is from the rest of the world. The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism rolled into this cozy, introductory scene. There was no need to stretch the history of the past beyond two hours of the film; Of course Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> End date. Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel (this time with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious, while depicting a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The original tour through Overlook is quite breathtaking, though the "staff" move things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fireplaces, the high cathedral ceilings and the expensive furniture, sleeper and crown moldings in the architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "awning" is well designed and beautifully built. The maze was a magnificent touch reminiscent of the maze, where Minotaur in Crete was the Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands on the scaled model of the maze and stares into the middle when Wendy and Danny come in, it's a magical moment; one who tells you right away there are heavy energies in that house; There is something seriously wrong, already in progress. "I wouldn't go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out." (Hotel Manager) <br/> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open to his accomplishments. His smile was natural and his performance was wonderful. You could actually think you were there at the hotel, taking the kitchen tour with Wendy and "Doc." His explanation of "the shining" to Danny was very well delivered, like his conversation with the baby about Tony and the hotel. It was trustworthy and sincere. The intersection and panning of the hotel itself, with the mountains threatening backwards, the cold air whirling, the fog coming up from the hot roof of the snow-covered hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the film. It also marks the "half-to-hell" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall's depiction of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So ​​what if she also played Olive Oyl?! It just shows her marvelous diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took it back as soon as the movie started. She's brilliant. In this Enemy's view, this is her best performance to date! (Although I loved her in Steve Martin's "Roxanne", 1987). the pearly bits of information that you, the viewer must possess: Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental" but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the hotel, As you all get in the 3 open sequences, the movie never stops scaring you. <br/> <br /> The two slaughtered daughters of former caretaker Delbert Grady (the girls have been several times to Danny, first at Tony's The apartment, before the family ever left home, was icons that Danny had nne identify and which he was afraid at the same time. They scared (and haunted) themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way. Kubrick's Tony was written as an accompanying spirit as a spirit director, whom he acquired as a result of his arm almost being turned off by his own father's body. He was ... "the little boy living in my mouth." He would manifest at the end of Danny's finger and physically speaking through Danny to speak to Danny. Not as in the book, I realize where Tony was meant by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy and tried to save his father. Kubrick got out of that little twist and somehow frightened it when Tony "took ... Danny ... over." The idea of ​​Danny's older ones, who are projecting back to their younger self, is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The "Woman in the Shower" scene, made by Lia Beldan (about whom I can't find other credits to have done sooner or later), like the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who also Seems to suffer from missing credits for works sooner or later), was seductively unpleasant and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Abhorrent and scary. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees his destructive flesh under his hands; The appearance of pure terror on his face was so complete and genuine. Jack starts his trek quickly from the "jonesing" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd Bartender (who only alcoholics will be mental patients and drug addicts) urgently needs the atmosphere that Lloyd enjoys; for alcohol ... "hair of the dog that brought me." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, free to Jack. "Orders from the house." (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice play on words. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds Jack's "manuscript" is no more than page after page of the same line written over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. when he asks from the shadows: "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with baseball bat in her hand ... is so exciting. That's the point where she discovers how horrified the whole situation is ... how confused Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. Combined with Dana's visions from the hotel lobby, which fills with blood, this is imposed on the stage between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational end to this scene, this may make the strongest scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do I say? What mother wouldn't be completely freaked out of the awakening to find their young, restless son standing over them with a big knife, talking in the freaky little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over again? Although it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and have) remember (ed). Talking about memorable scenes ... Nicholson's last attack on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the craziest scenes in film history. His ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere Johnny!" was a glimpse of shine and is one of the most memorable scenes in the horror story. It also goes down in horror movie history. <br /> <br /> The end ..? Kubrick's end was perfection. I felt it ended beautifully. No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie. Just epitomized perfection. That's all I want to say about the subject of the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what was taken out? See what Kubrick put in. Rent it, see it, buy it. It is a classic in the horror genre and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me is me * ... Take this movie and put it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Authorized" version done by King and hold it in the kiddie section. This is where it belongs. .: This movie ranks a 9.98 from Fiend :.
