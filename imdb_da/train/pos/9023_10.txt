A very gritty, gutsy depiction of part of World War 2 history that most of us in the US had / have no idea ever happened. I would love to have this on video. It was only shown on t.v. once I know, back in 89 or 90. I asked about this movie and most video stores don't even know about it. Great actresses around, Want me to see it again. Top notch series.
