My Super Ex Girlfriend showed me to be a pleasant surprise to me, I really expected a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what? It was! But this movie had so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that everyone could get a kick out of. I know this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was a great addition with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun, and that was what made the movie right well. <Br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, it's my best friend's real name) is not your typical average librarians when Matt, your average man, asks her he is in for more than he expected, he is asked G-Girl out on a date, the superhero of the world! But when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is, and decides that it might be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny doesn't want it when he's fallen to another girl, Hannah, and she wants to make his life a living hell, I mean, let's see, he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break with. <br /> <br /> The effect was corny, but you are seriously moving past them quickly, the story and the cast made the story really work, and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step up from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I could get a laugh out of what anyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
