(Some spoilers) I haven't read the James M. Cain short story ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this movie was based, so I can't compare this movie version to it, but I've seen and love 1946's American version (also called 'Postman'). Even better, this gem of Italy, which I have read, was "mutilated" in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime. Well, no matter ?? What is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realistic movement in film making. One can definitely see why ?? Despite what hard editing took place, a pervasive sense of societal and cultural as well as personal repression stays heavily over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life. Consider Gino, the young driver, not well-educated, unemployed, and resorting to spelling away, stealing, and closing people to pass by, his one pair of shoes being so crazy to be virtually useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna he sees a way out, but he should have kept going when Giovanna is suppressed by her beloved marriage with an older man with little money, her job (working on her trattoria man, slaves behind the bar and in the kitchen) her sex. Previously, she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, who played Juan de Landa) anyway knowing that he would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> On the pretext of helping Bregana straighten his car and send him into the village to buy a necessary part (which he actually packaged) Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to solve the broken water pump 锟 斤拷 Water symbolizes life, or lack thereof, and stands alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a heated, passionate and yet fleeting love affair. <br /> <br /> Soon, Gino feels the cattle of the relationship and feels the need to move forward when Giovanna suggests they sell her husband. Gino does not leave the city on a train ride that he cannot afford, kindly paid for by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a passenger by train. To Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), travels and finds work in a carnival together. Finally, Gino still has employment. To his dismay (he is not yet over his love for Giovanna), a month has elapsed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival, and Bregana persuades Gino to go home again to live and work with them again when he is convenient to have around. <br /> <br /> For weak will to resist, knowing this will reunite him and Giovanna, Gino enters and goes back to stay with the couple. After a while he gives Gina's demand to get rid of his husband. When the evil deed is finished, Giovanna becomes more cold blood than ever, which apparently has very little conscience, while guilt and shame eat in Gino to hurt a man who never did him any harm. As much as he will leave her ?? He does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked the way Spagnolo character came back in Gino's life to act as a judge of his dishonor ?? It was very good and interesting and added another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the '46 US version with Lana Turner and John Garfield is being lost a bit in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the police and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime alone on the lovers. This gives the final result even greater strength and makes a strong statement to strengthen the helplessness associated with the society in which the signs are to live. <br /> <br /> A lesser vagueness: The amount of time (almost none) running before beloved love is taken by the lovers, how quickly they kill the man (there is no botched first attempt as in the American version); Ginos very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer / hooker ?? they also praise their love quickly, and she is willing to risk a lot for a man she just met! ?? everything quite unrealistic, isn't it? I found this time frame problem quite distracting ?? It made me think I must have missed something somewhere. Otherwise worth the viewer time. The action and direction were both uniformly good throughout. Recommended.
