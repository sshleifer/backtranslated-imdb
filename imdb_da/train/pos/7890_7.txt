Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last movie to make up Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as a unit or a co-star). The year of the killings has taken a toll on the city of Springwood. It has come to the point that the small town has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. Only the madman lives in the city, and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But it doesn't stop Freddy from seeking his last revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back to more. But this time he finds a little more about his old life. Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's winding mind? to find out you need to see Freddy's Dead. The ending was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to end the franchise. Freddy learns about himself and his perverted life, and he is going to go into a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger are in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A whole lot better than the last one, but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If you enjoy the series then you will not miss this one. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
