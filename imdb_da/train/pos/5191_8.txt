Scott's right. The best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie. The sword fighting with more warriors is not the best, although it is quite good. But the battle in the middle is the best even in relation to Japanese samurai movies. Chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a guy must fight a group of enemies, Japanese films such as the Lone Wolf and Cub series are distinguished. Although duels in Japanese cinema only lasts seconds or a moment, these intense intensities made them better. But this is an example where Chinese swordplay surpasses Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five minute battle with the most amazing choreography ever. The other games in this movie are also good, but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 to one scene. If you haven't seen it, you need to. John Woo is the man.
