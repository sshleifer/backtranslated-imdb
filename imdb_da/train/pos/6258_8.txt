They might have skipped some of the start - I'm not sure why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was because they started in the Mediterranean, they could have started closer to modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> A camera and crew come to the Bakhtyari tribe, which is the beginning of a fantastic 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this amazing trek across what appears to be a very fast moving Karun river. They use floats that are kept floating by breathing goatskin - you can see where the head and legs were removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I guess an increase of 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> Just seeing it was incredible, but there was much more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of this documentary was some of the mid-titles with poor humor attempts. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the quiet era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe does not only face but conquer. This is just an incredible document by a little-known group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
