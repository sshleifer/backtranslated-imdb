As a long time Red Sox fan, I just had to watch the movie. It was good! Although there may never be enough live recordings from the Miracle 2004 Red Sox season, some of my favorite Red Sox players had fantastic photos. While the movie is definitely a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies all the time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben meets with his friends on draft day to decide who will make room for certain games is fun! One must see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date or other important ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more if you are the Red Sox fan !!!
