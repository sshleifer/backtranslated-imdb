I've always said that the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated movies, but out of the group this is the poorest and it's pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> "Phantasmask" would be the best, then "World's finest", then "Sub Zero", and then "Return of the Joker", and finally this series last. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated movie, there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham, and Batman intends to find out if she is a friend or enemy as she sits on a quest for revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce gets involved in three young women, he begins to examine them and discovers who is the new batgirl. The tone of this film is unusual light, as most of the films are gloomy and gloomy, which was rather disappointing. Bruce seems oddly out of character most of the time, the bad guys are reused from the last movies, and while the action scenes are exciting, they're really nothing new. It also lacks the dramatic impact of the other films, especially "Sub-Zero", which was heavy in drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie feels quite recycled and the supporting characters are charming, but no one is actually worth rooting for. <br /> <br /> However, I really enjoyed it here, I had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but it wasn't as exciting as I hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half out of ****)
