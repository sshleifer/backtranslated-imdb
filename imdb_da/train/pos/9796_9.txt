In 1993, Warner Brothers ordered the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, which was responsible for the hit show producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but encountered theatrical status. It would be known as Batman: Phantasmask. Ten years after Phantasm, we have three more feature films released by the boys at WB, Sub-Zero, Joker Return, and now Batwoman Mystery with the family. <br /> <br /> The reason is basic and in many ways similar to Phantasmask: A new female vigilant modeling even after Batman has started targeting operations run by Gotham mobboss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must try to dig up the mystery of the Batwoman before crossing the line. <br /> <br /> The animation is the slimmer, futuristic style used for Batman: The Animated Series' Fifth and Sixth Seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , it's pretty nicely done, and just as slim as the Return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it is less compared to the overload of it in Sub-Zero. The music was okay. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although the points in the score, when the old animated Batman theme comes up, will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans rodent-shaped hearts. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; including Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl; her cameo hints on the romantic relationship between her and Bruce mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Alfred). <br /> <br /> Villains were also good - especially when Rupert Thorne, the old mob from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Overall, while MOTB does not meet the standard set by Phantasmask ten years ago, the MOTB torch carries quite nicely to the animated Batman movies. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you'll love the five minute short Chase Me.
