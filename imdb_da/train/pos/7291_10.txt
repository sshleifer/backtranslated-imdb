When you typically see a short film, you are always afraid that the person who creates the movie is trying to throw too much into it. This is not the case with this one. A great story of a young girl who has had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right. Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of past justice and helps convey the complexity of <br /> <br /> Both the young girl and the father give amazing performances in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely the show star in this story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I absolutely recommend this movie for its complexity, performance, and all over history.
