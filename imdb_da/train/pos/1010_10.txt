I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I look at an episode, I repeat that line and remind myself of how good a show is. I'm a big sci-fi fan and this show has reasons to be the most important science (fiction?) Show in movie / television history. There are so many theories in this show about the universe, I could start a religion. I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 now) and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. Back when I first saw the Stargate movie, I could instantly like it and consider it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks and hearing a TV show would spin from what I was really excited about, but didn't get the time until the fifth season was nearly past. Although I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin would make a movie trilogy, but the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> However, Id says it turned out fine. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing and I hope it never dies. Atlantis here we come!
