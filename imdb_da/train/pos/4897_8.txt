This movie draws you from the get-go because it grabs our attention by recognizing, yes, that story opens with a cliché ?? a funeral. <br /> <br /> In hands other than Judi I would not have given it an 8, since this material has been done over and over again: The great reunion of once famous, choose a thank you, team, army plan, theater group, singers, bands. <br /> <br /> But this movie never encounters cheap sentimentalization, and when you think it's going to turn off in another direction. An example is the flowers sent by an admirer to Judi. <br /> <br /> The band members are an interesting group and also run across the clichés. One is in prison, one has found religion, one is an alkie, and one is immersed in dementia. But the joie de vivre rediscovered by Judi, ignited by her grandson's interest, carries us together and causes us to overlook the sometimes simplistic character of the plot. <br /> <br /> Cast is one who is talented, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes, a final performance by Joan Sims, Brava Joan, a sweet as a flirtatious Ian Holm button with a ball and Olympia Dukakis as a money-grabbing divorce in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey, the closed stage is the standard Hollywoodland fare, the star judicial children are converted into fun loving followers, the old lovers reunited, the young people slammed into the old-time music. Life should be so simple. But I wanted to see it again and intend with my own grandson. Because in the right hands, sometimes you just love these hugging old clichés. 8 out of 10
