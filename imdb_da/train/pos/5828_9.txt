Microphones are a classic Stooge card. The boys are inappropriate repairers working at a radio station, and during some horses in a broadcast box, Curly's perfect imitation of a "Voices of Spring" recording is wrong for the right thing leading to a radio contract and a zany music festival . The trio's mock reproduction of the quintet from "Lucia de L'Amamore" is especially entertaining. It is undoubtedly important to look at Stooge fans. Although the evidence of Curly's failing health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and that's probably the last glimpse of the old Curly. Some fans think "A Bird in the Hand" is the last big Curly short, but his rough voice and slow motion are just too hard to see.
