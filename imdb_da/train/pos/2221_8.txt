One night I stumbled upon this on the satellite station Bravo. Initially out of curiosity I decided to see it. To be honest, I was not disappointed. The protagonist is beautiful, and her body is good. You would believe her talents would be wasted as a fine, but apparently not after watching the whole movie! My only real gripe is the play that supports the melody, especially the actor playing Melnik. Christ is bad! The prison guard Hank is also making sure. All he ever does is get drunk and make sick attempts to pass on his co-supplied Wanda, but fortunately for us the viewer and for Hank he comes down and wipes with Wanda at the end. The music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions. This movie looks good alone for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
