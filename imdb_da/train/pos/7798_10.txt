I can't begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice it to say, whenever I am depressed at how unfair or in vain things work, it is the movie I am going to put in the right frame. The background music enables you to facilitate existence and how simplicity gives the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is only an example of a sign in this movie that does not try hard and is happy as a result. Persifina, The laundry's employee of Ruby's (Ashley Judd) is another = -this eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day. I see this movie, and I dream of better days to come or a good conversation with friends, and I'm aware of being alone - Ruby is quite often - is not the same as being lonely. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a thought-provoking style in a movie.
