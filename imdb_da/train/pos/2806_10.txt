Okay, first of all I hate to comment on this thing, but I felt I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it, and I felt that people who might want to see it should have a different meaning. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bend It Like Beckham is not supposed to be the most in-depth movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it should be artistic. It must make you feel good and you have to have fun watching it and the two things are done well. <br /> <br /> Second, however, the actor is still "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" still good. The film doesn't have to act like that, so honestly don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you wouldn't or shouldn't even look at this movie honestly. Finally, it has a really cute story. I think it is well thought out and it is entertaining to see. It is also very true for life mostly for that culture, so if you want to sit and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel comfortable when you are done. If you're looking for something with deep lines of thinking and big dramatic scenes, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
