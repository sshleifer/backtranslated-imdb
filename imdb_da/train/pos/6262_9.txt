This was incredible, which means that it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would do this amazing migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers Cooper and Schoedsack did not conduct any of the scenes and shots. But what a shot they are! The camera, under the most extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release gives this memorable documentary an extra wealth. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and "Kon Tiki" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hard and brave people can be, whether it was primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
