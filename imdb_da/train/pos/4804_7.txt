I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now, the first time I saw the other half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. an exciting entertaining movie, thank goodness no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a real insight into dreaming Victoria's difficult life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie at all, nothing really bad language or anything of a sexual nature that would insult to family viewing. Can ask the kids to investigate a little about Queen Victoria herself and perhaps lesser-known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
