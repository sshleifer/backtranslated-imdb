Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still light the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two amazing stars makes this combined reunion / start-up movie work. See it and look forward to hitting 60! Mary educates the youth-oriented society with wild and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. A TV series follow-up would extend the new characters and allow us occasional to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
