no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berlyn, dean stockwell, marilu her deserves a rating below 5 here. This is a poor man's version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run unless the prisoner is transported here it is very easy on the eye Ms.Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another gruff, maverick military type well and William Mcnamara plays his newcomer to be discharged foil well. The plot on the front of it is absurd because I lost count of the times Eleniak should have and could have avoided, but it is an entertaining emotional movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors who keep the film rolling. This is not really a family movie, as there is something heavy and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but it is much better than some of the other guffs that came out this time around.
