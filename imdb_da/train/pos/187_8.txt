Marion Davie's stars in this remarkable comedy "Show People" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, arriving in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). The jealousy they arrive in is a hoot - like Davie's monstrous southern costume. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets the co-star William Haines, who immediately fights with her. Well, Davies then gets a job on a more prestigious study ("High Art Studios") and lands a job in heavy periods. A beautiful but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her ropes about how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies surrenders his slapstick friend and father to the good life, but of course teaches that it's not who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful all the way as she - outrageously - drives old-fashioned feelings demanded by a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the film director King Vidor. This is an audio movie with a few "sound effects" as sound images just came into their own. A treasure of a movie.
