Although I am an exploitable youth when I first experience the Gundam Wing series, I have once again confirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but also the plot, the gundam design, the cartoon signature and the character depth are masterfully executed. While it initially looks like a boy's band of sorts, the character's attractive appeal can be partially credited to only great art, with individual personalities that create clear and inviting distinctions among the characters. Therefore, it is extremely easy to be attracted to a particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. Although I can be preoccupied with a sentimental attachment to this show for my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we achieve peace?), While there are action-packed struggles in great robot tips, which are at least excellent.
