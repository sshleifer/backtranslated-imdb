I have lost count of how many times I have seen this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue behind - but I am drawn to it over and over again. Seen in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the qualified bachelor "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". Kralik secretly becomes Klar's penpals, and in the workplace Klara confronts Kralik with the contents of his (Kralik's) letters. It is clear that Kralik is obsessed with Klara - but is not able to make his feelings known while in competition with the "pen". Confused? Now you don't have it - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know that this is the end we all want. Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan, who plays his usual role, this time as the shop owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidential. Joseph Schildkraut as the fierce arrogant "Vadas" - so well played that you can't help but hate him right from the start. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to endeavor us all with his over-confident upstart of a junior store "Pepi Katona". Recently re-made as "You've Got Mail" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - though I suspect the younger audience would disagree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area during Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a good glass of wine, make a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy.
