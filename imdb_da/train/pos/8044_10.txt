First of all, it's simply the funniest movie I've ever seen. It contains perfectly timed slapstick, sexual humor and wise thought uprising. But it goes deeper than that. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we don't see it often) that gave me hope there is love out there that two people who love each other can work through their adversity; And that such a comedian takes life (something I think we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written, and I hope we will see more movies from everyone involved in the future.
