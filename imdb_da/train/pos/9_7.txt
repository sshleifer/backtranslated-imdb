Working class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as incredible as they come, but there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both amazing). She is a widow who can't go on, he's illiterate and a inventor - you can guess the rest. Customizing Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!) Is so laid-back that it's beautiful and the movie's editing is a mess, but it's still enjoyable; a pink-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious problems (even the illiterate angle is just a plot tool for the subsequent love story) and no real fireworks, although the signs are intentionally a bit colorless and the wires are toned down to an interesting degree. The final is pure fluff - and cynics will have difficulty swallowing - even though these two characters deserve a happy end, and the picture would not be satisfactory any other way. *** from ****
