Nicolas Roeg's projects are at least variable, but are never less than interesting. "Insignificance" is apparently, above all, a custom scene game: it is verbal and pretty much the "space round". BUT it pays to watch this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not obviously presented, and it takes a while to adapt to the four main characters' compilation and roles: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is destroyed by guilt over Hiroshima, but simply fancies a sexual relationship with Munro; Munro is ill to be seen as a bimbo and requires intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch hunting powers, but is an impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is unsure of his celebrity, self-obsessed and exposed to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Each character has a troubled, abused / abusive past and a dubious future. Gradually, we see that occupation itself is the central theme. America's obsession with its post-war cultural icons and mores; protagonists obsessions for something no one can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. Compared to the theory of relativity, a proposed unit field theory and indeed the actual cosmos, all aspirations and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. But these aspects of the physical universe (that's all quantum, trust me!) Affect us when used for the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe mention of the principle of the neutron bomb (without denoting it as such) is not an anachronism in itself, but can only be understood by a modern audience. In fact, all the references in the script are only available to a knowledgeable viewer: an au fait with 50's occurrences / personality cultures and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This movie and its manuscript are either very, very smart or extremely opaque and pretentious. In the end, however, it is probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> Live long and thriving :) <br /> <br />
