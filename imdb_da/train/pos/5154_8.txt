As an amateur historian of World War II / Nazi Germany, I couldn't wait to get out on DVD. I missed it when it was first in 2003. I will not repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on the historical inaccuracies. Better work could have been done to portray the "charming" Hitler. I also had a slight problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their action but for their appearance. Peter Stormare doesn't look much like Rohm, why didn't they make Babson when Hess had a wig? And my biggest complaint. So much has always been made by Hitler's striking blue eyes, why didn't they make Carlyle wearing blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked good. Again, as long as people look at this, it understands that this must be entertainment 1. History 2. I don't think much harm will happen.
