adding all aspects of the movie --- the dance, the song, the action --- the only thing that stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her. Never have I ever seen anyone portraying Rose with such liveliness! Vanessa's song talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so incredible, though, as some people say, the choreography was poor --- her dance values ​​were better than ever! I would recommend this version over '63 just because I find out that while prolonged plays by Vanessa are amazing ----- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also very impressive (with except Chynna Philips ... what the hell did they think when they threw her?) All in all, I want to say that this version is wonderful and I recommend everyone see this version!
