Looking for Quo Vadis on my local video store, I found this 1985 version that looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very much a Ken Russell kind of movie-quirky, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." Nero was not presented as much as evil incarnate, but as a crazy, unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career. He probably wondered why on earth he was able to "lead" an empire - it wasn't that fun, and fun is what he longed for. Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for everything it was worth. Yes, Nero pursued the Christians with revenge; one of many who did. At one point one of his minions mumbles: "No one will ever understand that we are simply protecting ourselves." He got it right.
