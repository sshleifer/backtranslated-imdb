The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other offers developed from comics or comics. (Remember, the two are not just the same medium) In fact, it is ironic that this is the only adaptation (from the time of this writing) of Eisner's smart alec, clever cracking, heavy-in-cheek superhero. <br /> <br /> The story is that Republic Pictures were interested in making a movie version and were negotiating with the copyright owner in the mid-40s, but they could never close the deal. The screen on the left was the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best of the Republic. Perhaps it was just as good for the studio to have a penchant for tinkering with material adapted to the comics, pulpmags, radio and comics. As for this 1987 made for television films, it is quite obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. While an old, long-time cartoon reader, like myself, may be a bit harsh in criticizing an adaptation, a viewer who is not familiar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations without explaining the notions of what this screen version should look like. <br /> <br /> As you watch the story unfold, with the characters interacting in the midst of a crime wave, the little lady (my wife, Mrs Ryan) contented herself with a statement. "It can't be done if it's serious or not!" It describes quite well both the Spirit and his creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. <br /> <br /> The movie is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on display. The casting of Denny Colt / Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really well done. Although it was in a modern setting, it was still in the tradition of "the good old days" as far as the costume goes, you know when men and women still had! It brings this one final (and winding) point up, and that is that the director and the production have made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a Will Eisner look in terms of facial expressions and body language. We say Kudos to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that no series followed! Oh, well in today's movie scene, comic adaptations seem to be a hot thing. Perhaps some major hourly producers and directors could make a really first class SPIRIT production for the Big Screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 06/04/2008. At present, everyone who goes to the movies at Shopping Center Multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new movie of THE SPIRIT (subtitle, MY CITY SCREAMS); which is to be published Christmas Day, 2008. Now we should see just what we have talked about. Just keep your fingers crossed! CONTINUED ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw the new movie, Writer Director Frank Miller's THE SPIRIT release a few days ago. Well, we got our wish; But is it a good thing or another case of "Beware of what you are asking because you can get it?" Please read our appreciation elsewhere in IMDb.com. THANX!
