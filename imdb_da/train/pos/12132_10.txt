Entertaining despite Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. You have to be sad about this man; However, I find myself enjoying Bette Davis' Mildred. Miss Davis gives her her finest performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she brings this little boring movie to life. ** Be sure not to miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him.
