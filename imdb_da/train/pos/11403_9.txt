Gene Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musicals while he was with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative forces working with Arthur Freed's musical unit. Hard to believe when you see an American in Paris, players never left the back of the MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of an American in Paris is due to the creative editing led by Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed mixed with some background for the creation of shots. The idea of ​​the movie comes from Kelly, who just wanted to make a movie with a long ballet sequence with George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris. It was good to Arthur Freed, who approached Ira Gershwin, who said fine to him as long as they used other Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got that kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin usually got. Not a note of non-Gershwin music heard in an American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not real musical figures. Another guy who was a fair hand writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story, which is a thin one. Everything about a former GI played by Gene Kelly, who never left France after World War II, settled into an apartment on the left bank and continued to become a starving artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and sounds it ever as a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another alien American, played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter, if he wants to reciprocate in other conditions. But Kelly falls to a store girl played by Leslie Caron in her movie debut. Caron also interested the musical comedy star Georges Guetary here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to George Gershwin's music. An American in Paris is the first movie I've ever seen as a flying movie on the first flight I've ever taken. I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport when Gene Kelly does I have Rhythm. My favorite song in the movie, however, is Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant, who plays the piano. At one point, Kelly dances on top of the baby's grand piano. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote in which he said in the Americans in Paris that the ballet sequence should be done with the background of the French Impressionists, whom he felt the public would take rather than a realistic setting on the street or back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly had made long ballet sequences in words and music, the pirate and in the city. But this one topped them all. In a surprise disturbance at the Oscar, an American in Paris was chosen best picture for 1951 and knocked out the highly favored street car named Desire. I think the imagination trumped realism that year. Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things. <br /> <br /> Still, an American in Paris is one of the best film musicians ever made, and as the studios no longer have all the creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
