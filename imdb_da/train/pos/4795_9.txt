When I hear a movie being spied on because it doesn't have sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b. the detector goes out. Usually, a movie is like a sentimental hogwash, which pans for people who don't want to surprise them, but to confirm how superior they are to us, craving folk. So when David Lynch's HIGH HISTORY started to get these kind of reviews, I was worried, especially as I was not a fan of his second "uplifting" story, The Elephant Man. For all the amazing images and the good play in that movie, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us. <br /> <br /> I don't have to worry. The legal history is an honest movie rather than a saccharin one. Most of it is because Lynch and authors John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part. There are a few homilies of justice that I could have done outside, and the shoots of cereals harvested are repeated a little too much, but it's just choking. There is no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to move our feelings and no downsizing to us and its signs. Instead, they depend on the story of building their own power, and so it does, so at the final stage we are really moving. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth adds realism to that. He is really a person who resembles that he has lived a lot, but still perseverance, and with the exception of these homilies, the desire to come back with his brother is not too sentimental, because you can sense here is one who also has lived long and looked too much to be driven by anger for too long. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make peace, not just with his brother but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does fine, outdated work as Straight's daughter. And even though I'm a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin countryside is beautifully shot, making me at least visit one day.
