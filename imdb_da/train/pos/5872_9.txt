Who votes in these reviews? "Jacknife" is a beautifully acted, brilliantly observed piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the incomparable Robert De Niro (please do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man-see "Taxi Driver" to confirm this point). Is it a 'secular' movie because it doesn't have sex / meaningless action / nudity in it. This movie is about the complexity of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him, and his emotional outburst toward the end is heartbreaking. The part where he orders a young man in a bar to take his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and film exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire. While we are on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films ever, from one of the greatest instructors, starring the greatest movie actor ever, with the most eerie movie psychotic gangster ever, only guarantees just above average? COME ON!!!!!
