So I consider myself quite big in the anime scene, with very few shows, I just don't want to see. <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend this show to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series to date, it; s got almost everything I could ask for. A side story of an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted to, a very overt comedy and a very well composed voice-acting cast (both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly fun aspect of what it would be, just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, a "love it or hate it", very few people I have seen in this series will end up with a taste for it. <br /> <br /> Original for the core, with everything you can ask for in the afternoon, bet the house on this series. I'm ready to make sure you enjoy it.
