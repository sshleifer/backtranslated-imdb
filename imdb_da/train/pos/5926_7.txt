Sleepwalkers are creatures that drain the life force completely out of people to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He goes for similar Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it's a big horror movie. Fast, lots of blood and fun and a good, twisted sense of humor. There are plenty of joke references for horror buffs (Castle Rock mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought he could act on "Return to the Blue Lagoon") as Kirge and Amick. But I find this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen King and it is wildly vague. Sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why are they called? Why should the son give birth to the mother? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? What are their powers after all (at one point Krause disappears a car and changes color and style!)? Why do they need to feed the people's vitality? Why should they only be virgins? Why does your son have sex with her mother? None of these are explained and tells the story confusingly. It's really bad because these issues are aside this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, gory and lots of fun. If only the script was better. Also a fairly explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige was edited (you can tell) to get an R-rating. I can only give this a 7.
