This is a gem of a movie, not just for people who like fun and weird rooms, but who love the history and traditions of Sci-Fi and Classic Hollywood movies. Every foreigner of the Martian crew is the performance of a classic Sci-Fi character or a member of Hollywood royalty and it is sheer pleasure to see them jumping off each other and the residents of Big Bean.
