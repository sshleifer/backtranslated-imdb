A simple movie at first, a simple movie in the end. It has the infinite and pretending cliche, but most television films have it any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / driver. The marriage between her and the woman he works for, I think is a little queer, but I believe in the time it is set in that it is credible, not less. <br /> <br /> Now, I saw the edited TV version, even though the movie was made and showed on 'TV', I find it a bit queer as well. But I feel that if I saw the whole piece, I would probably give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still .... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
