Jim Henson's Muppets was my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Okay, Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the movie is 25 this year, and I hope today's children will learn to appreciate Muppet's Gang's audacity. The problem with the show is Kermit is missing and the gang needs to find him in New York City. It is worth looking at for children and even sentimental adults like myself.
