Let's set one thing straight: this movie does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's a silly flick, with three great female leaders (can't remember any other comedy with similar features), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler of SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, charming as ever. The story is basic: the three gals were "losers" in college, and are still after departments it. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind guy), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in the office" ... I caught it a couple minutes later ... I'm a little slow, okay!) and Dracht has a gay fiance (Seth Meyers from SNL, fun). They have to prevent the senator's "uncool" daughter (the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the television series "Joan of Arcadia") to bother her during the spring. So of course they have to go and look over her and some hilarity follows. All in all, a light, simple comedy, quite short and very enjoyable
