I have not yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book as this was adapted from, but I am familiar with some of his other works and was interested in seeing how it would be translated into the screen. All in all, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It's about the story of an American citizen in Germany, who is recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to admit to high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans via his weekly radio program. But when the war ends, he is condemned as a war criminal, but escapes to New York, where various odd plot terms await. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem, it tends to be a little too sentimental to times. But most of the film is schmaltz kept to a minimum and the very weird plot is accomplished with skill and aplomb. And there are some amazing moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very high-ranking Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended.
