This is a really fun (and sexy) movie - it's not just stupid but has great plays. It's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you want to be connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I often found myself laughing loudly with everyone else, and also moved by some of the movie's more serious parts. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I don't want to give anything away, but there are some powerful scenes too, really fun ones - plus the dialogue is amazing. Wood Harris' character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - go - you won't be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
