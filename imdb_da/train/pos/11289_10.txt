There is something weird about that a movie made in 1934 may be the head and shoulders of every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980 piece Greystoke. When the viewer passes the first three scenes, which are boring, Tarzan and his companion take a shot that offers non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and goes off with the movie. Whey rolls are also solid. Highly recommended.
