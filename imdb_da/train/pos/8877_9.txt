This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken. John Singleton certainly went beyond compiling this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances of the whole cast, but Epps and Rapaport became the best and most convincing for every young star's career. <br /> <br /> But as a student, many of the problems that Singleton touched were taken to the extreme. In a way, while they are problems facing many university campuses, they are not presented as big or out in the open, as this movie would make one believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something of this kind could actually occur. But apart from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the movie was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. One of the things from this image I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power." Brilliant, just brilliant.
