I swear, when I first saw this movie, I cried my eyes! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love really is, despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience how to lose a love like that at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such a great chemistry together and the music is amazing! When Streisand sings With another look at you / Look closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also love fashion in the 70's (except Streisand's aphrod. In addition, she is a beauty.). A star born is my first favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart cutter at the end.
