Excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore backed by Liza Minnelli and gracious John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man of a multi-millionaire family who was close to $ 750 million, provided he marries a lady (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met the fine and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he didn't work, he just had to drink hard and have fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just minutes before their wedding. The end was happy with Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew his life would change in the future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for all. Rich people are usually not satisfied with their life forms.
