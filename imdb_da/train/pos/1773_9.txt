Barriers seem to be one of the series that have been lost in the mist of time. After that is the transmission in the early 80s and a repetition, it has since been lowered without trace. This is a screaming shame. I initially saw this when it was transferred in the southern television region on Sunday afternoon and was classic tea-time viewing. Although I can't remember much about the program, there are a few things in my mind. Most notable were the unforgettable titles. The sad whistle music that accompanies the pilot flight over an Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and that scene has left me a loving love for "fintail" Mercedes models when they used a Merc 200). Although not clear at first, the solution to the series' mystery in these titles. The plot of a young music student attempting to solve what really happened when he discovered he was adopted had lots of phrases, but barriers were a surprising "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame that he didn't do much more. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama, too late for a DVD release, and I hope I get the chance to recall me in the future. <br /> <br /> A good memory from my childhood
