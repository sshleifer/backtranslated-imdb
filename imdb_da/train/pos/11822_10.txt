Dick Tracy is one of my all-time favorite movies. I must admit those who have not seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a cartoon ... what do you expect? Creative, this movie is amazing! The sets, make-up, music, costumes and the impressive play make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and not bad language - it is something rare these days. Directed, produced and stars Warren Beatty as ace crime giant goes up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best lines I've heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the movie is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a cartoon. This movie is really a piece of artwork that is unfortunately overlooked by the public. To sum it up, this movie brings the child into us all. It's a movie that leaves you smiling at the end.
