After failing a Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a true Martian invasion, a group of moronic martians show up on Earth looking to convince their plans to go wrong as they find really get out of their element and in fact all alone. This is really often quite good and fun, with some decent lines (just check out the memorable quotes) to start. It will most likely appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the time test for me when I saw it again recently, it turned out much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever put on film. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost any classic Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotype that is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier, and boiling scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to die! Earth foam!"
