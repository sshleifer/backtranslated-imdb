It's the kind of movie that the US doesn't do. That's why people rent foreign films. It is a great story of how a person, even if he is retarded, can cause a person to find reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally challenged suffer during their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). As a classic in foreign films, this movie has a bittersweet ending, but it only makes a better movie.
