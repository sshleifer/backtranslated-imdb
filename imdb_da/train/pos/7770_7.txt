"Written in the wind" is a Douglas Sir's melodrama. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., who greeted him as a master leader - I think it is because of the sophisticated filmography - "Written in the wind" offers delicious color images and beautiful decors. But I ask myself: Is it enough to carry a movie? The act of "Written on the Wind" ranges from weak to fair (except Robert Stack - he is convincing as the weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually a strong on-screen presence, is miscast in this movie. Dorothy Malone as the seducer, the carefree "femme fatale" is ok, but she lacks the strength of the role. Rock Hudson is effective but vapid. <br /> <br /> The reason has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A stiff patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a princess princess, former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought up with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read the history list on the back of the DVD, I thought I was in for a treat . My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written in the wind" takes seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before the play is generally not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an effective job. I think maybe with the Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would have been fully explored - they would end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. What is left for us is Douglas' beautiful filmography. Sirk. For me it is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Adventure".
