"Crush" examines female friendship, mostly avoiding the saccharin quality, which destroys so many films with the same theme (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The depicted events were very unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very real to me. Not a movie for the speed-vehicle-and-explosion crowd, but adult women are sure to react with both laughter and tears.
