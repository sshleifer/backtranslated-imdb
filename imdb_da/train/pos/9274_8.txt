Another great movie from a country that, due to decades of repression from fundamentalist regimes, has no trouble creating passionate subject. Panahi takes a different approach to this time with a mix of ironic comedy and a loving, non-professional cast. While still crossing his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need for a heavy story. It is a positive starting point for a country, especially its people, that the Iranian people desperately need. The biggest shame is that it will not be released domestically. The Icelandic, paranoid Iranian government claims that this fine film producer is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to scare them. Having grown up in the middle of the revolution and looking at academics, artists and educators 'disappearing' over the past 25 years, he shows great bravery by continuing to put his work out there. Realism achieved by shooting at the current World Cup really qualifies you for the event. The fact he shot it at 35mm is great, as most would only try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His demand for using only non-professional actors also really works in this movie. Fine performances throughout. Having seen many films showing the problems that Iran has and also the news media reporting on facts, we tend to demonize both the people and the government. This movie does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of the Sharia law, perhaps a change for the better is not too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist film producer, but I think he is just fighting for the most repressed demographic in Iran. Young, independent women.
