This was a gem. Great plays from the leaders Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporters. The film raises an issue that is not only relevant to Irish and Irish history, but to many communities around the world and many marriages within these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family. The title "Love Shared" could not capture it better. Although it was a true story and in Ireland in the 50th, see how life throughout the village erodes and "pogroms" begin to remind Russian history. Intolerance and prejudices are still too powerful in the world, and unfortunately it is deeply hidden in human nature. Like in the movie, Liam Cunningham's character says "The Hate had always been under the surface". It was interesting to see the moral choices people made in this story. Also the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite meaningful. The story, however, gives hope that love for two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the entire transformation during the history of becoming a man he would always be. Again, acting is a top class. The story is fast. Irish landscape is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
