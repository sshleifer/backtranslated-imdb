I gave this movie a 10 because it had to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god enging! The thing is, I don't want to tell anyone anything about the play or the story because it will destroy the movie. But I would recommend that you go directly to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it! (Don't forget popcorn!)
