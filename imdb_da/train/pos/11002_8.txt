Director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller that, although demanding a suspension of faith and lots of concentration, manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a stay At home man with an indulgent wife, decides to add a little spice to his everyday existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high tech firm Digi Corp. His job is to travel to conferences across the country (under the assumed identity of Jack Thursby) and secretly send the speakers back to his bosses via a nifty little electronic pen gizmo. In reality, however, the speakers are only a cover for much more frightening activities. Morgan joins his co-conference participants brainwashed. Drunk water they drink puts them in a temporary coma where they are told to forget their past and permanently adopt their new identities. When fully convinced that they are another, they are asked to apply for jobs from competing companies where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion. <br /> <br /> But the Digi Corps plans are scuppered by the interference of shady, operative-for-hire Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), which opens Morgan's eyes to what really happens. She gives Morgan an antidote to the mind that changes drugs so that he can resist brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not fully believe that he is Jack Thursby, he will be "eliminated". Morgan plays together and applies for a job with rival company Sunways. <br /> <br /> But when he arrives at his new workplace, he gets a polygraph test and is immediately shaken as a spy. Fortunately, Sunway executives see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp, and Morgan becomes a double agent. From here things are gradually becoming more complicated; The plot turns and poor old Morgan doesn't end up trusting anyone. In an exciting finale, everyone eventually gets ready (but only if you have followed the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Director Natali handles security actions and certainly has a good ability to produce a stylish movie for a relatively low budget. He manages to get some good performances from his talented cast; Jeremy Northam is especially amazing ?? His portrayal of the originally somewhat nervous Morgan is played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and I look forward to his upcoming projects, the High Rise and the Necropolis.
