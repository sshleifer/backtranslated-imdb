A great movie this and a shame that it will get some attention outside of the art circles and students who stay up to two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. The reason is simple, but works very efficiently, the veil between child-like imagination and hard-hit nightmares is very wild. The budget looks pretty low, but for the creditors involved it doesn't show too often. Nor has it been so much dated. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to lose this from the telly as it was a couple of years ago and it has resisted half a dozen views. It's one of those movies that won't appeal to everyone; But as usual, with a more thoughtful approach to the cinema, they will get a lot from this. Charlotte Buerke puts a good performance as Anna, it spoiled abruptly, and it is a shame she seems to have gone away from the actor. The cross is also very good, which carries the character of his character very well within the framework of the image. There are some really (and I don't say so easily) disturbing moments in this movie, both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions. Look at the lights out! <br /> <br /> Recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br />
