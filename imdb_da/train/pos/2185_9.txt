Bad Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who has lost his mouse. He has faked it for a while, bought his lyrics and his music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) happen to meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they have done. Complications occur, but everything is finally fixed. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing amazingly. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and at the same time doubled as a regular at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I do not understand, the movies did not go to her, so she went back to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> In one of the few times he played comedy, Basil Rathbone does very well. His ego is constantly deflated by sidekick Oscar Levant, and again I am surprised that they didn't make several movies together. <br /> <br /> As in most of Crosby's Paramount vehicles, there are no large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer whether the title lesson is made as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop. Good work for everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
