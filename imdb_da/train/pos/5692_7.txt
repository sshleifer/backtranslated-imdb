This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra-hungry porn stars, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also largely based on his life. Maybe someday someone will make a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead. The problem is that the story is not much told. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more terms than Wonderland, and the director never gets the criminal case with any gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is almost as hung as Holmes is (and no denture this time, unlike in Boogie Nights), and he looks much better than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce a single sympathetic individual among the cast. The racist, immature lowlifes he is associated with, or his wife, and the police do not get much in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian, who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> Having said all that, anyone who is interested in the hardest part of the porn business in the 1980s or sand crime should not miss it.
