I'm not a fan of newer movies, but it was a great pleasure to watch. Adults and children could see it together - how unusual! My aunt also had a good time. It had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. Hero Paulie, an intelligent parrot, separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always taking into account his decision to find his friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
