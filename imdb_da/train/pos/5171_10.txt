If I could go back even as an adult and relive my summer's days spent at the camp ... I would be so quick. The camps I went to were not even this great. They were in Texas, where the mosquitoes actually transported people, but we had horses and fishing. The film cinematography was amazing, the characters fun and credible especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and sub-antics were invaluable. So who ever thought this movie was paralyzed ... I'm deeply sympathetic because they can't suspend their unbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult, or they never went as children. The whole point was that these people had the opportunity to regress and become young again and then they did at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was fun, intelligent, beautiful script, brilliant cast and the artwork takes me back so I will see it again and again just for nature itself. Sorta who dances with wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies but the desert becomes a character as much as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and see it again and again and again ... never get old. ; 0)
