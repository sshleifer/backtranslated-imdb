This movie was amazing. It had an original concept (a vampire movie meets Yakuza mob film). It is a humorous and yet very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness and commenting on the community. On that part of Gackt Camui, Shoy's role was superbly delivered, and HYDE was surprisingly good at his first movie as the tortured but humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and wept at the happy character Toshi who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the fun Cigarette scene, the fighting situations and most of all, the heartbreaking ending.
