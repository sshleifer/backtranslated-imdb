How can anyone argue that Urban Cowboy is and still is the best document of Texas life for the time period. Consider the following: men beat their wives, get crowded at night, marry to run a fight, commit adultery, and compete for mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that portrays real life so vividly. They don't make them anymore. It seems that current movies are always about people with lots of money, living in big homes, running expensive cars and not working. This movie has a party scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake! At least I see it at least once a week. You do not say. I have dissected this movie from end to end. send me an email to learn more about my reason to call it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are split - he amicably bunches and waves, she flips him the bird - he turns half of the peace sign waving the horn to add beats then tears off. <br /> <br /> Buds mother calls him approx. 18 hours after he enters the city on a Sunday to see if he has a job yet - all he has achieved is full and laid (x2) with the help of his uncle and aunt covering him. <br /> <br /> "You all live as pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Couldn't we figure it out without showing the dirty wash? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked the crap out of her husband. Steve asks - Hi Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, you didn't beat my husband up the second night, let's get this lesson gone, not to mention the fact that she is seeking comfort in him later during a Bid and Sissy's many battles, which incidentally take place in public - in Gilleys! <br /> <br /> The wedding recipe picture takes session (oh humanity!) Can they at least arrange or move chairs out of the way. "My legs are the sweatin 'momma" In conclusion, you do not set scenes like this in a movie to try to show insight into human psychology. It is a documentary of real life. <br /> <br /> I just wished there was a director's cut ....
