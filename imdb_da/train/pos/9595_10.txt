At the start of this film, one of the commentators says he was told he has two strikes against him: he is black and male. But in addition, he has a third strike: he is gay. "You have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he says. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay black and Latin American men who are tranvestites or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> Miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could very easily become a freak show and give people in it their humanity. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that it is tragic. Many of the people are seriously denied; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this movie of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, you will realize that "Paris Burning" is not about men wearing women's clothing. It is a group of people who are routinely marginalized and abandoned by society as a whole and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives. I have seen this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things: it is a comment on materialism in our culture, on gender roles, on rich and poor people, on the media and on what it celebrates and fame and adulation . "Paris Burner" is one of the most humane and one of the coolest movies I've ever seen.
