This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious; I didn't want to see it twice, but: I'm Peter Cushing completist, and so I looked at it. The best asset in this movie is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it does NOT pull the feet forever, as each of the four (plus one) segments lasts for less than 30 minutes, with the last under 10. Good creepy vibes. In the first segment, the writer who suffers from "author block" moves to a secluded old house seeking inspiration. He finds himself too much of it when he begins to visualize one of his fictional madmen. Plot contrivance resembles PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of point of view twist: The switch becomes psychologically ill ... or (as the end shows) his wife's wife wants her to play with the man's phobias to drive him angry and secure his property ... You will survive the scheming bimbo to survive enjoy the fruit of his brilliant plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long lost friends join together in the same secluded old house, but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum with the wax statue of their long-lost youth's love, who once separated them. From the gothic museum holder, they teach the portrayed woman that it is a deceased driving killer ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> fourth shows a feature film actor - who thinks he's the best of all - immersed in the depths of low budget C movies. Seeking a costume to give more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the right deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> It is fair, with the 2 introductory segments contributing most of it. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing, or Lee ... but worth seeing.
