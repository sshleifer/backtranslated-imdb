The tweedy professor types thought they had all figured it out. Today's people who are in Polynesia come from migrating Asians, moving effortlessly from the Far East, the island to the island, east of Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands in the South Pacific over thousands of years. But the established thinking just wasn't good with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If that explanation was true, how come some people born and bred on these islands, have traditions, art and physical features reminiscent of those from Asia, but South America? How can the vegetation in Ecuador, Peru and Chile look as much as you would find on the island several thousand miles away? Is it just a case that the islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that this is where their ancestors came from, led by Tiki, their corresponding Adam? Meanwhile, how are the Norwegians talking about Scandinavian predecessors, who were hunted from the South American continent they had colonized, and along with some of the native people they were friends with, they set themselves over the sea - on the way west? It's too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crew members and the local know-how for traditional rafting, an expedition begins. It is just as much a journey to human imagination as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the very basic tools and seamanship. The Oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it is related to a fairy tale spirit who orders the space program itself, which was launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk it all for testing a theory they believe is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's a great side-turner and the perfect setting for the movie with the news.
