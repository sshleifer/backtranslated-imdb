Pierce Brosnan's latest but no longer James Bond is an assassin. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow businessman. Now that the story opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. So one night they have drinks in a bar and they start talking. So suddenly you find that the two people are pulled together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the play is top notch, and humor is fun. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be so much fun, but he is real and I must say that this movie is a must see.
