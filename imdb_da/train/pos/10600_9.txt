This is a very fun Ealing comedy about a community in central London which, through an unusual set of circumstances, discovers that they are not English but is an annex to the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> The feature features comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY) as well as a host of other classic cartoon actors. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on a news at the time when the Canadian government "officially" gave a hotel room to a visiting European royalty member. The idea actually reminded me of the Hutt River province in Western Australia, where a landowner "fired" from the Australian government because of a wool quota conflict. (It was never recognized by the Western Australian or Australian government). <br /> <br /> This is a good script that plays with many political and economic issues, rather than the TV show "yes minister"; as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well.
