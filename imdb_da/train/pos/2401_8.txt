Guy Kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very under-rated actor, is great at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not matter to voters. A campaign based on no comment, "I take it for advice" and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe no" is the almost perfect way to win a choice. Succinctly, stupid the candidate, the greater the chance that he or she will win. On the contrary, the public can identify with such a person. With regard to the film, it creates a lot of comedies.
