Gray Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange and funny and sad and sick and really no words can describe. The Gray Gardens movement is beyond bizarre. I found out about this movie, which read my uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the bathroom reader's institute and it was worth renting and bumping to the top of my movie watching the queue. This film is about the most nourishing most eccentric people who may have ever been filmed. One should see it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I certainly have with curtains. When I grow old, I almost want to be like Big Edie, my thumb's nose at normality and society.
