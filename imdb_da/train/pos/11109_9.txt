The Soprano stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the underworld environment, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a shallow, low ground, and a complete average deconstruction of postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each figure represents a facet of American industry. Tony Sopran exemplifies the besieged work rigid, torn between family duty and a need to keep his "business" on a smooth keel. The convergence between these two things is crucial for history to move forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect on the loyal - but self-serving subordinates present in any business that is trusted out of necessity rather than profit. With Ralph's character, Joe Pantoliano sets a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who flourishes by violence, outweighed tragically by his amazing earning power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquities old guard who retains power through established relationships and the need for breeders to mitigate the blame. Although it is abrasive and occasionally disturbing, the Soprano has earned its place as the ultimate television drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good companion to Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugly characters interesting.
