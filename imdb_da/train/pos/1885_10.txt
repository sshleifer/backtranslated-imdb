This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was happy to watch it on DVD, which is a relief from seeing the old, grainy VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I hadn't seen it this year and saw it today to find myself amazed at how good the movie is on time. It's one of the rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (really fun line after really fun line) is paired with great direction and great performances all. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for Best Supporting Actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" doesn't win a best actor Oscar, it's proof that no comedian actor can ever win the title. (Another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon's craft film beautifully adheres to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story. Simply IMHO movie is a rare gem. It's only sad that Steve Gordon died a year after "Arthur" was released. <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD is available from 1/2007, it is. Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a few extras that are good, but it's just not enough. An example is a comment from the director on how he liked how certain deleted ones would take, and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he should make hard choices for a final editing. The DVD, which is the perfect format to include such material, should surely have offered it as well. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one of the books.
