CREEP is a right up serious horror movie set in real time that won't have more than just showing people being attacked in an empty metro platform with a mutant for 85 minutes. And it just does. Nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith extracts the drama as far as he can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked. He also leaves the origin of the titular Creep conscious guard (illegal experiments taking place in the 60's underground are suggested) and the little bit of mystery works mostly. Unfortunately, he undermines himself towards the end by holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations will occur (they are also suggested). Yeah, you heard me right - I wanted a cleavage ending! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potent is good as the terrorized female leader and the rest of the casting is fine.
