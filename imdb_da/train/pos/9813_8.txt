This episode introduced Holodeck to the TNG world. Jarada must be contacted and a precise greeting must be handed in, or it would greatly offend them. A tired Picard decides to take a trip into Holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins. The settings are amazing and almost movie-like. Unfortunately, Jarada sent the probe shortly afterwards to damage the holodeck and all its safety devices stop working. Picard and now guests must overcome the gangsters from the United States and return to Jarada rendezvous. Picard welcomes Jarada correctly and a new day begins between humanity and Jarada. This gem of a first season episode put holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be there
