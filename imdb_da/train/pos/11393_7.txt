Uggh! I was really not so impressed with this movie, though I have to admit it is technically well-crafted. It gets 7 for very high production values, but for entertainment values ​​it is rather poor. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the movie is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. It's because unlike some musicals that have a fair number of songs along with a strong story and acting (like MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all song and dance. In fact, this movie has the longest song and dance number in the story, and if you're not in it, the movie will quickly drill you. Give me more history! As a result, with overcrowded production numbers and a weak history, this movie is a stable diet of meringue - it just doesn't meet in the long run. <br /> <br /> Thinking ... this is the movie that hit "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the best picture! And to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more amazing to me is that "Ace in the Hole" lost to Best Writing, Screenplay for this movie - although "An American in Paris" had almost no story to talk about and was mostly driven by dancing and singing .
