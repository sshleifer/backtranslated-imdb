I was treated to a view of Cracker Bag last night before a preview of Disney's Holes. I don't know who decided to show it, but I'm so glad they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80s seen through a child's eye. "The conversation" between Eddie and her brother was fun and, as with the rest of the movie, so true to life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood (it was the same age that the director probably helps a little) and the sound increased the feeling. I just hope I'll see Cracker Bag again someday.
