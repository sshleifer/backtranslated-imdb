This is not a good movie, but I still like it. The cat Clovis is gold in a jar as well as the cat's premise itself - unlike the evil sleepers. I think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it's very hard, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. It has the corny lines, the sudden end and a comedic element carried by the bumbling policemen. <br /> <br /> Has anyone found the incestuous element a little disturbing? In the end, this movie is random and randomly acrimonial, which is quite effective, I look like the Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, change of main characters. I think the abruptness also works, it's not a movie you want them to prolong. It only works if it is short. I'm still not sure if the director lacked depth or whether he did it These things for purpose we know, Stephen King has the ability, but I haven't even read his books, only seen some of his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like hard corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it. but don't expect too much. It's really that bad, it's good.
