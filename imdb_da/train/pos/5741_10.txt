One of my favorite movies, I watched in Seattle. Tom Hulce was fantastic, with words able to convey his feelings / thoughts. In fact, I've sent Mike Ferrell some donation money to help the movie be distributed. It is well. System says I need more lines but won't give away plot stuff. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and director, a writer, I believe, and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour after words. Not really a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be stupid, I don't know. (in fact I know, it's our fault, see what we see) Well you get what you pay for guys. Get this and see it with someone special. It's a gem.
