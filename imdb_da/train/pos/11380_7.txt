Although the word megalmania is widely used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too stiff, one must admit that the guy knows how to put a show. In American in Paris he choreographs some outstanding figures, some of which break the plot, but it is nevertheless fantastic to look at. (Check out Gene Kelly's "Get out of bed routine" to begin with) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly stars as a GI based out of Paris, he stayed there to paint, soon he is a rich woman gigolo, but he really loves someone else! Hoary's story for sure, but the musical tracks are hiding the show here! I really loved Georges Guary's voice work on this. His 'Steps to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene on 'Wonderful' are amazing. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. All in all, a pretty good but not dynamic movie.
