One of the things that interests me most about this movie is the way in which the characters and their related stories evolve on the fly. I suppose the authors wanted us to get interested in the characters by not forcing their characters to feed. The principle of using art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and / or analogy for what families / siblings go through in life. The complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even a man added great excitement toward making this movie emotionally interesting. Although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to (ie, the Jewish / Twins / Family industry), the themes are quite universal, as each family has a variety of sheep. It made it very engaging.
