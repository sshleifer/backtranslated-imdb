When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it wouldn't be a mindbender movie. Instead, I thought of it as an unbeliever of reality, where someone will have a serious blow. And you know what it worked for. Kurt Russel did what I myself was a remarkable role in showing the emotional soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if you're out with the boys and want to see a good action movie.
