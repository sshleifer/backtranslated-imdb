This movie has several things that go for it. It's a "feel good" story. The characters and actors are sympathetic, realistic and contemporary fine performances. The most important thing is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw a baseball. Robert Redford so good both to throw and swing a bat in "The Natural" and so did Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In the Major League, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen saw what they knew they did, but many of the others didn't, and the picture was stupid - and not so funny. <br /> <br /> So many former baseball movies, even where the stories could be interesting, provided such a lack of baseball capability by the leaders, they were ridiculous in that regard. In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command" Jimmy Stewart saw as credible as a professional baseball player as your overweight, non-athletic, older uncle in the softball game of family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (eg Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while "picking up" for a game on Sunday picnic (though coed and even though your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes at Quaid High School held him where he participated in his test with the Devil Rays and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League are all right. Participants are trustworthy and skilled. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except to some extent his "over-the-top" scenes and his compulsive accent in his depiction of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is determined on goals here, and this movie is a "9", as good or better as any other of this genre, except "The Natural".
