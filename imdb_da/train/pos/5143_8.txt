With the quick interconnection of scenes of insane people in an asylum, and mounting / overlaying images and vague, interwoven narratives, this is a very difficult movie to follow. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) takes jobs as a gatekeeper or guardian of an asylum, so he can be close to his imprisoned wife, and perhaps to save her. But she is clearly sour, huddled on the floor, with a free expression much of the time and fear, misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. The filmmaker sometimes changes to her point of view, and we see vague pictures of her beside a pond that drowns a baby or cuddles on a drowned child. She's bothered by something. When the point of view changes to her or other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things, showing us what angry people are seeing and how they react. And the place swarms with crazy people, laughs, hides and in one case dances frantically night and day. At one point the man tries to take his wife outside, but the night outside the door fears her, and she runs back to her cell. Eventually, the man slips into a nightmare, where he is interrupted in another attempt to steal her away, and he kills the doctor and many shivers, and constantly suffers from madness and applause. When he wakes up, he is relieved and poked the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japan's life, streets, buildings of the 1920s.
