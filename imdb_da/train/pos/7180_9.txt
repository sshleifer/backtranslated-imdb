Twisted, bizarre, enchanting and fun! I couldn't stop laughing watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on the family camcorder that grows up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a budding movie maker and his motivations and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but we do not see all the movies that have to be manipulated in some way? <br /> <br /> From the beginning I was amused by the fact that the boys in the movies seemed to be shirtless when possible. Later, Darren commented on his budding homosexuality and you can see it from hints (big hints!) Of flamboyance at an early age. Maybe it was just the hot southern California weather, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment, it is good to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his protruding talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put the camera on me" glances back to the 80s untouched by commercialism. You will remember the hair, the music and the fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the trip back to the memory court was welcome. His solo-lip synchronizing dance number is invaluable, enhanced by Frankie Goes To Hollywood t-shirt. <br /> <br /> The film deals with dark themes on time. Child abuse, Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree, and how Stein deals with these issues is interesting to say mild and fun to see. <br /> <br /> See as soon as possible!
