This should be one of the best if not the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. Had enough to satisfy a fan, and yet it was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and had me connected from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Added blood and gore in there, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the movie and even had a tear jerk ending for many people I should think. <br /> <br /> It's a must watch for anyone. Seen many reviews, slating the movie, but to be fair, most movies that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best. this proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
