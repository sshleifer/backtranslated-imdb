"Bourne Ultimatum" begins with ruthless mid-chase and in vibrant fashion explodes from there, as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, amazing) tracks down masterminds behind CIA black-ops, making him the perfect killer in a last attempt to learn its true identity. A devastating ice cold David Strathairn as "man behind the curtain" is added to the recurring cast of regulars, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). As the other post I see that Paul Greengrass's shaken handheld camera would go static at least for the few minutes downtime. That said, it is a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic sense of the intimate hand-to-hand combat scenes and work just as well in hunting scenes that are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional large car pole. -up. Part of the Bourne series fun is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communication that seem to defy physics and current abilities. The Bourne movies seem to exist in some form of gritty hyper-reality full of technology-based magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be right in the right place at the right time, but I will be cursed if it is not to see them coming there. <br /> <br /> With the absence of the emotional and involving Franka Potente, the authors try to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so devoid of an actress, it never leads to anything. Nevertheless, this can be forgiven, because unlike "Identity" and "Superiority" this reveals "Ultimatum" everything, and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion in the series, and if they have a good sense and Damon gets their wish, it will be the perfect end to it.
