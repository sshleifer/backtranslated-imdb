I recently caught up with this little gem of a movie on cable. It surprised me even though I should have expected it from the team involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell instructed this movie with a safe hand and it shows. One is always wondering about the secret lives of the murderers. One does not have to go too far to realize that they are probably one's own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends; they are no different than us, at least on the surface. In this story, Grandpa is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at the right price. He has no screws in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to the grandchild! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he has done before and suddenly realizes the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. When he goes to Dr. Parks, he tries to find absolution even though he doesn't find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who to kill next. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, fascinates us. Not only is he a great actor, but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, whose grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in Sarah's lead. She shows an ability and reach that is incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering wife, and she doesn't get much to do. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is grandma from hell. David Dorfman, is a joy in the movie. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
