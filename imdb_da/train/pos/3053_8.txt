William H. Macy is in her most sympathetic and convincing here as a hit man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his indulgent parents. Treads much of the same area as TV's "The Sopranos" with regard to the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here he also visits a shrink) but is still worth seeing thanks to a tense direction from Brommel (I'm looking forward to what this guy is leading next ), an excellent script, and around good performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is at his creepy best as the dominant father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly dramatic trip as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (which I usually find abominable) is convincing as the troubled young woman catching Macy's eye. All of this is drawn by a moving score and a sharp pace that leads to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching recess. This movie deserved a much broader release as I suppose it would have been associated with the audience.
