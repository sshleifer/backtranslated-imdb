Suraj Barjatya is best in marriage films. And here he is; back to his basics at Vivaah. As the story goes, this is a story from engagement to marriage. A movie you can see with your whole family around you. A movie you would hate to see alone. The story is simple but the music is good, cinema is excellent, direction is best, everything about the film has its own class. There are many scenes that make you cry and are sure that if you watch the movie with your girlfriend, you will both hold each other's hand to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi has given us hit films earlier as Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, it was not well accepted by the public. A real Shahid & Amrita movie.
