At the start of the film we see May and Toots preparing their trip to London for a visit to their adult children. You can see Toots is not in the best health, but he goes together. When he dies suddenly, May's world begins to break. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a play by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure expresses its new status in life and her awakening in a world that she doesn't even knows that it existed so far. <br/> <br /> Mays life as a suburban king was probably boring. Of course, her sexual life was almost nothing. We are told that she has had a short extra marital affair, so nothing at all. When she loses her husband, she can't go home again, so instead she stays behind thinking her grandson in her daughter's home. It is in this setting that May begins to smear after young and hunky Darren, her daughter occasionally loves. <br /> <br /> In May, Darren is a passion she has never known. May respond by transforming in front of our eyes. May, which at the beginning of the film is dowdy, suddenly begins to dress and become an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling heads over heels with this young man who holds her seated with a passion she has never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a few cases similar to this story, it made me no surprise to see corn reaction. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends frustratingly in May, who understands how great her sex is with Darren. The young man we count on is only in this affair to satisfy himself and for an opportunity to extort money from May. Finally, her daughter Helen discovers what mother has done behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings the mother has made. <br /> <br /> The movie is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of corn. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will respond to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also crucial to the story as she is the one to confront the mother about what has happened behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as Bruce's older man in Helen's class and is quite efficient. <br /> <br /> The movie is rewarding for those who see it with open mind. <br /> <br />
