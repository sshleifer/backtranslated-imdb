I wouldn't say this is a bad movie; In fact, it is quite typical of the type of film released by the "poverty line" studios at that time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in her role as the slightly demented medical scientist who is a respected member of society. In this film, Bela and his minions have the unpleasant habit of stealing young brides and after their death, Bela's wife injects with a serum taken from their bodies to keep her young. Lugosi is more than up to the task of making this an enjoyable movie, but the film suffers from the ultra-wood performance of co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. The coffin (nice name for a guy in a crap) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen him in many movie and TV shows, and he's always the same; stiff, wood and completely convincing. Miss Walters is a little better, but she also lacks the acting talent to make her role credible. However, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi action out yet another dastardly scheme to be filled only at the end! Despite the poor who work by some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is an enjoyable movie for everyone to see.
