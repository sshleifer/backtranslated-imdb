This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The reason was treacherous. <br /> <br /> The action sequences confronted. However, provided you can brighten up enough to laugh, it was a very exciting move that combined Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. The wicked were more stupid than bad. The good guys were not too good. The black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a baby added a good touch. Sympathy could have been a little difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I disagree on acting. It was very good overall. I really wanted to beat Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And that's not a sign of a really good movie that wants to beat Judge Reinhold?
