This is a very unusual movie because the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally halfway in. Nevertheless, I was engaged to Phantom Lady's hook. Curtis, though competent as the fake accused Scott Henderson, looks a little hard to be sympathetic to (maybe he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the police at least in someone degree of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone like Jack Marlowe, I found his portrayal of the character to be impressive complex. He's no stock villain. Excellent character actor Elisa Cook Jr. is again in top form as the 'little man with great ambitions.' His drumming in musical songs added a welcome touch of eroticism. However, this film is borne by the highly skilled and comely Ella Raines as the devotee would be the lover of Henderson, Carol Richmond. She has absolute talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I've seen, and I'm clearly inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the support molding is also more than competent. All in all, a very satisfying film noir mystery which, when viewed today, conveys the dark and complex city world all the way. Recommended, 8/10.
