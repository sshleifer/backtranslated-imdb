This other movie is just as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no excitement. We know what to do and what needs to happen before it even appears on the screen. Then the joy comes only from the way the different tricks happen and their succession. We know that there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will get a crash just to talk about the car. And that's what happens. Now the details and information are for you to discover in the movie. That he may be stunned by a stupid woman is obvious and must come, but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows that he is being dragged into a trap. How does he get out of it? You have to find out for yourself. And don't worry, he'll get the main trafficker, but how's another story. A speedboat does not fit our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he gets hurt. They didn't know which bulletproof jackets were these days. It is true recently that it was discovered that some GIs did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This insistence on chasing the traffic jams and this blindness that does not see that is the ban that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that can ever stand in the way of this moral crusade against the forces of evil. Why don't these goods legalize them so they can be properly observed and monitored? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, it is fun to use them to make them. It is the forbidden or the limited that is attractive.
