A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with Cedric (the beautiful Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. On the one hand, I was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys. On the other, I was annoyed - the film is constantly flashing from the past to the present without rhyme or reason. It is very confusing and meaningless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> Also, there are plenty of plot holes - Mathieu at one point doing something that joins him in the hospital. What is it - we are never told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he lives with him. Why? We are not told. Then he chops inexplicably with another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. Clearly Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu living in the same city so ... But it's a tribute to the movie that you really care about the characters so much. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, beautiful and has a good body - but he can't act. His idea of ​​acting is sitting with a blank look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is large. He is very handsome, has a very nice body and is a hell of an actor. He also has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a pretty explicit sex scene in the movie, which is amazing - most movies are shy of showing male love scenes. This does not, and it helps to see how the characters are caring and feeling for each other. <br /> <br /> So a frustrating movie, but worth seeing - especially for Rideau's naked scenes - that is, if you like pretty nude young men! <br /> <br />
