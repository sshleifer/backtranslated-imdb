Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love history? Maybe hell, you know how the formula works now, beautiful woman is introduced to a picture to fall in love with her. I think this movie follows some typical stories, but it doesn't say anything about the content. There are amazing scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, though short. Some things weren't sensible, for example, the need to get into random matches, but it's entertaining to see, the fighting was actually well done. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a comedy above all, but it has a very good sense of it. Humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach this, but you will keep a smile. There is a bit of steaming action, so not one for the kids.
