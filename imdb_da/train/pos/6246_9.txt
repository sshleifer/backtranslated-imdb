It is not an excellent idea to see Dog Stage if you are not 100% sure of your mental stability because it will be hard tested with this movie, no matter how sensible you are. I have to say Dog Stage is an art movie rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to enter their lovely side. Kind of like Tarkovsky movie, but different in a way. I can't even say I had fun watching it. But it's an excellent and very interesting experience for those who are only bothered by the clich√© that Hollywood offers. Dog gestures stick a finger right into your brain and scratch your mind all the time. You can't just sit back and see what you use to shout or look wide open throughout the movie. A movie that looks like this in style is the Nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better and much less violent. For example, this is not for children or those who are mentally tender or poorly tempered. Most viewers will probably give either a 10 or a 1 to this movie. I give it a 9 because I've seen the phenomenon of several stories-in-one movies in another movie and it was better. But this is an excellent piece alone. Worth to see, but get ready to see something disturbing.
