After watching the movie last night, I was back with a sense of hopelessness towards organizations trying to tackle the problem the movie portrays. The prostitution scale seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be defeated without major state changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, continue with the review. <br /> <br /> Although it is a gloomy movie with an unpleasant central relationship. This is a very compelling movie, and I would even go as far as saying it was fun. The movie was well edited for the operating time, and Thuy Nguy's performance was excellent. I also felt Ron Livingston played a very difficult role well. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick feels he should help Holly, but perhaps the reason is a simple one that he explains to Chris Penn's character. I don't want to explain this - see the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking movie with obviously good intentions. I hope it will be enough to reach a decent large audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
