"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (named "Esther" after a famous American movie star) and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all maybe 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are dedicated friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or anything American it seems. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship between teens is exciting, and ultimately a victim is willing to try to help one of the group who has fallen into unexpected difficulties. In the aftermath of changing communist politics, they go their own ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. The subtitles of one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues that had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversation rate required it, but I couldn't always read the text and absorb the scene, which made me not always understand what character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story of acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslavian forthcoming movie is effectively conveyed to teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal ties to each other. There is a big flashforward and it was exciting so I guess the end of who these characters were relative to the 1953 cast and what had actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other movies by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
