Although this was, of course, a low budget production, the performances and songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a fantastic dancer and singer, and he also demonstrates his acrobatic abilities - watch out for cartwheel!) Also with Jason Connery. A great children's story and very sympathetic characters.
