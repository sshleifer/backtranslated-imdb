This film is a moving story of an adventure taken by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a still incurable disease that took his brother's life at the age of nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the United States. He and a couple of close friends travel all over the country to Los Angeles for the purpose of getting his wheelchair adapted to MTV's, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The band head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget. Darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time, ride in a hot air balloon, swim in the sea and visit the sights he has always wanted to see as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers obviously have an emotional connection to the material. They don't make money from selling the $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes to investigate the disease and $ 3 goes towards making multiple copies. The film has won over 25 awards at festivals, and I agree with the quote from Variety, "Certain to stir hearts".
