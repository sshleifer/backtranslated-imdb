I know there are some purists out there who poo poo something that is not exactly like the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own profit. I like the new Iron Chef because it corresponds to the Japanese version, but at the same time caters to American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with flair. Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best cooks on the planet at that time, but Bobby Flay is the only American iron cook to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when making food, making comments and being flashy while creating. I've seen the series and find all the players work well together. However, the judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions that the lawyer became madie, but most judges are doubtful about being able to do what is served. I enjoy watching the chef's hustle and bustle and the challengers are surprising. The food at the end always looks fantastic, and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe it's just all you can ask to really eat what is served. The only thing I really wanted to change in the series is to ask people on the show to provide a little information. Sometimes the mood becomes a little too excited and it is not always fun to see when you expect more pleasure. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was so over-top as the original, but I can say that it was a rather expensive proposal. I wish he had been with this version and been hosted - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown who wanted me laughing for an hour. As long as you don't expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series on your own benefits, you can find it an enjoyable hour.
