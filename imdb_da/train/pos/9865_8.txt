I watched the movie with two adult children. Although it wasn't as wise as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In a movie theater surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know that the kids all liked it. Parents are also provided. The character's death and apparent death led to the appropriate gasp and comments. Hopefully people are aware that this movie is made for kids. As such, it was successful even though I liked it too. Personally, I liked Scrat !!
