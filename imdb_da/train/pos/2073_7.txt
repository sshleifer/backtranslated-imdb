In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. Much revenue was generated by Sheriff's Department catching speeders. Those who tried to run from the Sheriff? Well, that gave the Sheriff a chance to push them out of the Clarksberg Curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the start of the movie, a couple of service men on leave are trying to get back to the base on time, pushed to their deaths if I remember correctly. Then a stranger drove into the city. Possibly the coolest hot roots in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord seals. In possibly the ultimate hot rod. A black flamed '34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hell fire. He is picked up to speed up the Sheriff on purpose. He checks out of the country. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice to kill his brother and to correct things, so "this will never happen again to anyone": restoring chase and definitely the competition hot-rooting style to death. He goes out to the curve and practice. The sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to master maneuvering on a particular stretch of road.
