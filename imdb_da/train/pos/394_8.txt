This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, Tsui Hark. It's one of a few movies that deserve to come face to face with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie started, there were astronomical scenes on each edge that were <br /> <br /> discarded with stunning style. If you're a science fiction or Chinese martial art "geek", you'll love the vast array of many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There is a good performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung, who plays "Sky King". He joins Louis Koo (Red), as I was very impressed by his flexible "wing" that mitigated incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were skilled in every way. Not only is the action fantastic, but it has a somewhat complex history. Many critics of this movie complain about the lack of history / theme or just "pushed into random pieces of waste" and even describe it as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer cannot trust to see Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons understanding this movie. Others who are famarialy with "Wu Xia" movies will have a better appoach. With due respect. There may be a weakness that could be expected. The battle that was delivered to the enemy on the very first battle scene could have been more significant and devastating. Despite all this, it has to be seen.
