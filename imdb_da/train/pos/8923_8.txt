Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi-flick. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and as they go looking for it, they run into an old man with some weird ... blob attached to the arm. They take him to the doctor's office and then go out to find out what happened. From there, the blood spreads and eats everyone in its path. The special effects are cheesy fun, like the story. There are many good hands like cop who play chess over the radio with a policeman in another district. It is not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8.10.
