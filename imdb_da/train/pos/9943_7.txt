The film never claims to be something spectacular as many movies do. The films recruit themselves as a fun and entertaining time. And that was exactly what it was. It's the Korean version of a man Bring It On. <br /> <br /> From the start, you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it will end, but the enjoyment is not in surprise terms or is it the way the movie is a carbon copy of another. Instead, the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the two remaining "thugs" came to be men in their own right. Therefore, the movie is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The camera's work, especially the dolly movements, was done very well. The writing, which was weak, was far too entertaining in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This movie won't win any Oscars, nor any DVD blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
