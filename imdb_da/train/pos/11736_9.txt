Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego Elvira, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" starts with our heroine with gravity, challenging the breasts who receive a message. It seems that a great aunt of her is dead and that she must be present to read the will. Excited to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to come in hopes of getting lots and lots of money. Unfortunately, the place to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to spell because of her car breakdown, she finds out that her big aunt left her 3 things: a house, a dog, and a cookbook. The residents of the city have mixed reactions: teenagers like her, women hate her, and the men desire her (though they try to remain moral pillars in society). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because he wants his cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a book of magic that will make him a more powerful warlock. The movie is actually quite fun, with Peterson aka Elvira using her "donations" and sexiness as a joke ("And don't forget, tomorrow we show the head with two things ... I mean the two head case"). Especially fun as Edie McClurg as chastity Pariah, the woman who works hardest to keep the city in the queue, but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Deserves a look (the movie, not her breasts, of course).
