I feel this is one of the best movies I've seen, I'm an older man and love most westerns. I love movies based at least on facts, if I'm not mistaken, it's such a movie. I also like revenge type movies, this also qualifies me so well in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with whipping and barn photography. I felt that the corral beating scene was a little overkill but didn't affect how I feel about the complete movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode. I also enjoyed it. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I will see it again. I also felt that the romance parts of this movie were well played. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play a villain type, but I always enjoy his acting.
