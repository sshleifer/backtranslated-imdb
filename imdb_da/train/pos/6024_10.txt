I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a big disappointment. Its script seemed forced and bow and for the fakey '60s. It's politics for advance and ridiculous. And let's see, I was still under a love table known as BLOWUP: and I still haven't shaken it completely. Now, "love" is twisted up with all kinds of nostalgia, it evokes and, okay. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time has been good for ZP and time has been a teacher for me. I visit this movie every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is its own "experience" and is only really connected to BLOWUP through its creator, the late, great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had the great fortune to see a totally pristine print, projected with its correct size (huge), restored by an Italian state's cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see It, and by the importance of keeping such a beauty in good shape. To this day, I remember gasping from the audience when Death Valley's first shot appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had deliberately delivered to awaken us to a new level of consciousness. And what follows from this point is a completely different kind of "place". What is amazing to me is how this movie comes into its own. I remember the second time seeing it --- early 80s --- I had begun to feel love towards the movie as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. While these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet), they were now engaging me - especially The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She took her time. . . Living. Everything, everything dies about her. <br /> <br /> In exciting theater, daylight reality began to quickly erase my new found "enjoyment". The inner shoulder padded, big haired 80s whispered "But it's a hippie fantasy --- let's go" <br /> <br /> Antonioni's vision power I had already realized, even worked within me the FIRST time around so I replied "The 80s with a" Uh-Huh "guarded my" love "secretly, possessively and jealously, but it is so good art living in you, and if you wish, it has its way and" loves " you back: secret, jealous and possessive. And you get "changed." <br /> <br /> Be thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show the ZP in the March series. a gigantic screen so it can really take you into the constructed environment, but hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, ZP is has been pulled back mysteriously and replaced by ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So it's still too "difficult", for "disturbing" and for "what" ? It may be that with all the good art it lives while everything dies about it. <br /> <br /> Peace.
