I recently watched this 1954 movie with Vincent Price for the first time at Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician / inventor driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor). Although Price is a killer, I have actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character driven by the greedy people around him who continue to exploit him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie doesn't 'I don't have the "horror factor" of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, "House of Wax"). Nevertheless, it has enough to keep viewers interested. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent Price fans.
