My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. Saw 10 out of 10 from our family. What about violence? Not really so violent, mostly by the slap stick variety. No one really dies, no one does, no blood, no torture, so it is certainly appropriate for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, textures wonderfully made, with real depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, rusty on metal, the reliefs on the tree and the stone add everything to everything. <br /> <br /> Unlike many modern CG films, character modeling is quirky, not sweet, again within an artistic whole. The faces may look less vulnerable than some other movies, but the characters are more puppet-like than human. I think this is a good thing, it makes sense how strange it sounds, it is easier to suspend your disbelief. Hair, fur, clothes, on equal foot, at least with like Pixar. Just note in the opening scene when Lian-Chu struggles with the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers and everyone has detailed clothing that made me pause the movie just to admire it. <br /> <br /> Setting. Far beyond cars, and even Wall ?? E. The space has been done many times, but Dragon Hunter's fantasy environment is only comparable to some scenes in Never Ending Story and the Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole and with many good ideas thrown effortlessly. Magnificent outlook as the scene in Monsters Inc. where they run all the doorways through its storage facility or Wall ?? Where we see the huge trash cans he made are abundant in this movie, everything is grand, yet never lived it's just the background all the way! Interlude where they go through the area with the amazing falls. The Great Wall, the islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? It is really where I think CG should go, do something that breathes and does it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not just epic, and fortunately without any vocals and purely original for the movie. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. Lends its inspiration to cartoons, especially a good use of stretch and clamp. Sometimes not so realistic, but the 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu's gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing into self-confidence, based on little Zoé's attention. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the Gwizdo Wily leader of Lian-Chu redeems himself while Zoé doesn't really change at all, but who wants the sweet kid to change anyway? At least I loved Lian-Chu more than any other innovative character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal struggle in the group is radiated by the external pressure, just as it should be in a proper fantasy story. <br /> <br /> The story is most reminiscent of the Never Ending Story, especially how the world slows down. Monsters are quite standard fare, except for flocking one. It lacks the emotional effect of Wall ?? E, which is the really strong point of that movie, but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying musical scene played in the former and has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> As I have mentioned, the whole film has a whole vision that seems to have been rigorously followed. <br /> <br /> It seems like the setting is ready for more adventures, and I for one would hope so. <br /> <br /> A side note, the French actor who makes Lian-Chu sounded like Jean Reno at First, but I'm glad it wasn't him, even though he's one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new, to me, voice. <br /> <br /> I give it a max rating, somewhat surprised by the mediocre and low ratings of some; I have tried to address some of the concerns raised by two of the lowest-rated reviews. Approaching this movie as an adventure, and as a European movie, not against Hollywood, but different.
