Oh, the sneaky Italians. It is not the first time that they based a movie on source material without permission or knowledge of, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course it is not something that is typically Italian, but has done quite a bit in the early days of the cinema, mostly because they often thought they could get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this film from American screens until 1976, but even though the film itself has become a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't as good as the American 1946 version, but it's a great movie anyway. This is of course not least because of the film, it is a great strong story, it is an exciting and gives the film some beautiful figures and realism. It follows the story quite closely and is therefore pretty much the same as other movie versions of its history, of course as a difference that it was put in an Italian environment. Let the Italians make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early drama always have a very realistic feeling about it and are therefore also quite involved. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power towards the end when the film began to feel a bit long and pull in parts. The movie could easily be completed 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I don't have much else to say about this movie. It is simply a highly made, based on something equally large and strong source material. Completely impressive director's debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to lead some many more amazing and memorable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
