I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that has never happened before - a secret service agent goes badly and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, "Pete Garrison," they think he is the mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a moral error agent with an affair with First Lady! When he does, he cannot give an acceptable polygraph exam and it causes him to lose number one when it is revealed that there is a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" has to go on the pocket but at the same time he still tries to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I don't always care for the people he plays, but he's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is as good (at least here) as the other SS boss who chases down Douglas until he's convinced he has told the truth. When he does the two work together in the final to discover and then stop if they can, plotted. The bad guys are also interesting by the way. Also, I never - and will never, unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> This is simply a smooth action flip that entertains start-to-finish. Are there gaps in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and one reason why you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfairly bashed here. It's just not intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this site. My advice: chill, just go together for the ride and enjoy all the actions and intrigue. Yes, it will be a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it will be high marks for entertainment ..... what is film about.
