A must for any punk rocker, it's the movie that made The Ramones a house name again in the early 1980s (as it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best of the American Punk Rock movies, with a cool classic status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" had just made them superstars and too hot a topic to be in a low budget movie. Good luck to the Ramones who were trying to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the regular market (which unfortunately never happened before after the ties went down). The band, Dee Dee in particular, has always looked a bit against the movie through the 80s, but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to enter Ramone's shows. This movie, like most classics, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones footage in their heyday. Don't expect more, you won't find it. It's fun, so enjoy it. Another Allan Arkush classic movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
