Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the glass of Hollywood in the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also tackled proto-feminist themes, which, when touched at all, were addressed in such a gingerly way that it was rarely clear what was being talked about. In an act of violence, she treats rape and its aftermath, and throughout the short film it is referred to as "criminal attack", once leaving no doubt what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary accountant at a large industrial plant; She lives with her parents but is engaged to a bulging guy (Robert Clarke) who has just got a raise and is now making $ 90 a week. When she leaves the plant after working late one night, she finds herself stalked. In the subsequent scene ?? the best in the movie ?? She tries to escape her pursuit in a forbidden maze of buildings and alleys, but fails. <br /> <br /> When she returns home, disheveled and in shock, the police can't get much of her; She claims she never saw her attacker (who manned a snack car outside the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing happened, she returns to her job, but falls apart and thinks that everyone is staring at her and judging her. She walks in a fugue state, runs away to Los Angeles on a bus, but stumbles into a rest stop. <br /> <br /> Waking up in a strange ranch house, she learns that she has been rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in a Californian farm town. She lies about her identity and takes a job package with oranges. The two fall wildly into love, but it is clear to Andrews that powers hold evil secrets. When at a corporate picnic she tackles a wrench and cracks in Jerry's skull that tried to steal a kiss, the truth about her past comes out. <br /> <br /> It was brave movie coming out in 1950 and it can explain and excuse some of its flaws. Lupino never resumes enlistment of the early assault scene, and the film wanders out into bucolic and sentimental, ending talky and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to give, but she didn't rely on the story to speak for herself. Her thrown, pleasant but bland and generic, was not much help either, not to return to melodramatic attitudes or homespun reinsurance. But Outrage was a breakthrough that broke a track for later discourse on what the rape crime really is and what it really means to its victims.
