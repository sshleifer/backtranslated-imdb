Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers Columbo has ever had to deal with. And the plot is brilliant all around. This is one of the best Columbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supportive roles. And Peter Falk delivers a little extra in his scenes with Gordon.
