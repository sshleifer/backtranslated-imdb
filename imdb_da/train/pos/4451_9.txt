The story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods stumbles through a murder of a young child and tries to convince the police that the murder has taken place. Although there is not much dialogue throughout the film, the visual narrative, as the camera's eyes told alone, made the film quite engaging. The setting of the gray forests gives a sense of loneliness that complements the silence of the characters themselves. We can also feel helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police murder, which is parallel to the silent child's inability to tell his own story. True horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This movie successfully addresses these elements using visual images rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror movies use when the story is weak. <br /> <br /> It is certain that history unfolds at a slow pace to build tensions for a few scary and startling moments. The ending is also unexpected and credible. Reminders of Japanese horror movies, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horror movies, such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", give this movie viewers the experience of real atmospheric screams. I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the scarecrow to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven't seen the movies I just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try too.
