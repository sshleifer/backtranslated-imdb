When I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in a rural area, I felt like I was a child again! Swim the pond (it is called a "tank" in central Texas) that runs through the land as a wild free spirit! The story was very credible, and I completely lost it and cried to the end. Through the pain we go through in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
