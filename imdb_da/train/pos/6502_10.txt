Although I was too young to remember the first show of the series (just a baby), I later repeated it on television in the late 80's, just as I became interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests that related stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and seen many TV series on World War II, with mixed opinions. The UK television stations are generally very good at producing these, as The World at War can easily attest, with many gems made by both BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles like "The Nazis - A Warning from History", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkerque. "Britain At War In Color", with its companion series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​is of a very high standard. The world at war is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to prune, apparently not in the series, and of course the Second World War took place over a large canvas that to produce a series of every detail it would take more time and money saw someone else, even if such a business was possible. What I feel I have to say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that The World At War cannot physically do it as a series, but it is safe to ask you to do further research - and make fun. It worked for me safely: I now have a very extensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone with just a passing interest. The series was so well made that they would find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and very informative.
