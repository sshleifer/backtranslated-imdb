Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle, a Winchester in a shooting competition. Henry Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals the gun. Lin takes his horse and goes for Dutch and his men and gun with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The gun comes in different hands on the way. Will it come back to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and brought this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play lead.He was always the right man to do something. The amazing Shelley Winters plays that part of Lola Manners, and she is amazing as always. Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie and they are played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull, and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point, the group is surrounded by Indians, as this is a western. It's great to see this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter are the winner. All the true western fans will love this movie.
