I thought it was one of the best followers I've seen for a while. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die, Stanley's killing of those annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a well-made movie that you were happy when you and then died. My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. Judd Nelson is sweet, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
