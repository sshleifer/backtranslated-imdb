I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why she would always cry in the last few minutes. Of course I found the whole movie fun, especially the characterization of the characters. It was only until I was much older and then again that I realized how much deeper this show is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as the restrained mediators. Keaton stops wondering with her real lifestyle, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply amazing in his role as comic relief. I think this movie is one of the most underrated 80's movies. We can all learn a lesson from the merger of the American and Japanese workers in this movie ... sometimes you can * have "the best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in the closed moments. I'd rather also have one of these cars.
