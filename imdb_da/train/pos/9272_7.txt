This was the first of Panahi's films I've seen, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely absorbed by the various characters he creates, and how they react and behave in relation to Aussie children and yet on other levels. Perhaps I think if more people could see movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism, which can often be driven by fear of the unknown. There are the obviously great political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I found the more subtle differences between the characters that this movie is flattering successfully on screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me so unique. I found it made the characters convincingly view.
