This is a very fun movie, easy to see, entertaining you almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable, and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical policeman's story as deadly weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of Argentine variety. Twist is that one of them is a psychologist who is played by Peretti and has to go with detective Diaz (played by Luque) on his duties while he also helps him (Diaz is uneasy because his wife cheated on him) . Some of the dialogues are hilarious all over the world: understandable and ridiculous everywhere. It's very good overall, it would deserve an 8, but I rated 7 because it gets a bit down the end. On a personal note, I must add that it is a "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, as the little good has recently come.
