Rawhide was a wonderful television western series. Focus on a band of trailers led by Gil Gil trailer. Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons - were really character studies of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike the Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes they appeared in. Rawhide was a true gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable sign never to be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's show, the show was a massive hit. Of course, he was strongly supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their mark in a piece of television history. Rawhide caught the taste of Western time that no other series has for me, yet managed to do so. Later seasons tend to divide the leaders and give them individual stories. For me it was part of the time that didn't work - the cattle drift and the regular people gave the best stories. But there were still some classic stories, and Rawhide remained top drawers affair. The black and white photograph added a gloomy, realistic feeling that other western series rarely managed to intercept. Rustlers, Indians, Commanders, beautiful damsels in distress, serial killers, they all proved to give our heroes problems. The end came quietly to the series, as last season was run less than halfway through. The reason - Eric Fleming was gone and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the grim realism was gone, Gil Favor ordered respect and radiance - he was never infallible and made him more interesting. We can't see his like again. See an episode when you can, they rarely disappoint.
