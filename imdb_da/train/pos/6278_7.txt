I saw this on a flight to the US and was a little skeptical at first when a few people had said there were so many signs in it that you didn't know any of them. But I didn't find it at all. The movie is fast, but it is due to the nature of the director and the star. Chase scenes are excellent and yes it can be predictable, but that's not true for most movies. The biggest villain is a bit of a disappointment, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but it still said a good movie.
