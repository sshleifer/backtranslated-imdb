Big voices, lots of adventure and smart dialogue make this a very good movie. The addition of "character" to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older guy, Shadow and the young hellraiser, Chance. The previous versions of this movie could not give the animals any real personality or motif that is perfectly done here. Sally Field is lovable in something, but really shines in this movie as the proud cat, Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and decision excellent. There is even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain landscapes. Absolutely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. Hats off to Disney.
