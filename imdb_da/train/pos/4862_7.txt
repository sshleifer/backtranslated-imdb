This musical is certainly mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but it somehow succeeds to be most fun. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, even though he contributed the script. The songs, although charming, have nothing to do with this particular movie, and are exceptionally ugly pressed into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen make their usual shtick quite competent, but it lacks the tone of the rest of the movie with about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are a few highlights. Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops smoking as a silent actor. And there are a few pieces of writing that could only be written by Wodehouse, although most of the film feels like the production of one of the Hollywood meetings that he later parodyed.
