A bus full of passengers is stuck in a snowstorm. The police have closed the bridge - saying it is uncertain and they are stuck in a small cafe until the road is cleared. But after a while, their boredom has been worried, as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and maybe just a stranger! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also pretty fun in a low-brow way. <br /> <br /> This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical phrases or social comments, this has no lasting message. But it is also very and tough, so who cares? Exactly what happens, just look for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this one star John Hoyt - a face most of you will recognize from countless old television shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane in the same era), but boy I loved to see him - when he perfected the grouchy persona and was sweet fun at the same time.
