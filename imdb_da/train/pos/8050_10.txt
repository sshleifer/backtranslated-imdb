The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo movie that has him imitating his character's hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is incredibly Lee as in his actions and battles. The way he slides into Bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar kung fu, is a joy to see and show how accomplished and adaptable he is in his art. Throw some slapstick humor so loved by this type of flick and this is a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some incredible combat scenes. <br /> <br /> A great beer and friends movie worth a while and a half.
