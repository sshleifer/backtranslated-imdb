The 14-year-old in me is incredibly happy that they can now make really great fantasy films, and that they are all rage, what with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia makes lots of cash at the box office. This year we will see (and have already seen) more, especially The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with a little more than a look. I saw no examples of it, just a few advertisements. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it, if not for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else was interesting at the weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible proverb, the stars must have been properly adjusted, for I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The baseline is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero goes out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within the basic disposition, history is alive and imaginative. It simply aims to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were many great movies this summer, but none of them were almost as fun as this one. There is a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost completely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it can certainly occupy the same kind of land that something like The Princess Bride has (although I don't like it as much as the previous movie). It is very fun to be here if you are a fan of the genre.
