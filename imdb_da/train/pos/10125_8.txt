This film is the first of Miike's triad society trilogy, and the trilogy starts with a good start. The films in the trilogy are only linked thematically, and these themes are actually evident in all his films, if you look closely enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his brother-in-law from being involved in a rather extreme gang outside fighting their way to the top of Tokyo's yakuza. The young brother is a lawyer, and the triad band is increasingly in need of one as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore quite heavy and hard. Miike has done worse, but as this is a serious movie, it is hit very hard. As usual, there are also many perverted sex, most gay in this. The film is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a good drive and real grin. If you've only seen Miike's colored movies (Ichi killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth checking out as it's a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style shown in these movies and his more serious side as it is seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will never forget (see it and find out which ones are for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
