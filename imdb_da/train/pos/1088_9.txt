Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are completely cast as middle class couples who want to build their dream house. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both blowing apart by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many good laughs (though the story is a little thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style. A clear highlight comes when a contractor goes through a decrease in all expenses, which must have sounded quite exaggerated to an audience from 1948. When he makes his exit, he assures the customer (Grant) that he might be able to achieve a $ 100 reduction , 00 from total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but definitely $ 25.00. Hysterically fun!
