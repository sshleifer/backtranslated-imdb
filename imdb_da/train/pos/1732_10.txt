"Sandra, Making of a Woman" is a standout among feature films, and for two reasons: (1) an excellent but effortless performance by Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents, both of which are quite undervalued, make "Sandra" a movie to be seen. Another important part of the movie's success is its realism - there is nothing false or "Hollywood" about this set-in-California movie. It really is a piece of life. The modest house where Sandra lives at the start of the movie, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart jumps at her front door, and Sandra sits on the sofa without make-up While Digart is trying to sell her some cosmetics, she looks like she just woke up (yet beautiful), picking up the harmless usirdo Sandra, who likes to love with her while wearing a bra, one bedroom apartment in that Sandra moves - all these elements in the movie seem real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into Sandra's small world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her the case for free love with eloquence and dignity, and she gets rid of a lot of classes. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have failed in less skilled hands and could have gone in any of the usual sex exploitation directions, but the Tanner / Crazy team makes sure that "Sandra" is not just a woman's work, but also an excellent movie.
