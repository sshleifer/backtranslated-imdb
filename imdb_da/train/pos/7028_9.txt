So this as before, by accident, I have seen it twice now. I thoroughly enjoyed it, no silly thought-provoking messages just good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a good movie. Recommended to those of us who just like to enjoy movies and not dissect them. Fun for the whole family here. I didn't realize that Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sweet. The songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really fun to listen to and tap your feet to Jason Alexander's complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman's is very good. Tyne Daley still sticks to my mind from Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still had it. Overall I just loved it and will look to buy it if it is available
