I watched this movie last night after waiting ages and ages to be released here in Canada (still only in limited edition). It was worth the wait and saw some. I am a very keen reader of Margaret Laurence and was thrilled to see that this novel was transformed into a movie. I actually ended up feeling the movie better than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character was a little less tough and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, who made the scenes at the end of Bram's life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was not more sympathetic to film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She was through Hagar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more good things in front of I am sure. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on again, collected a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on DVD, a must be for my collection!
