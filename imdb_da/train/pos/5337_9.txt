It may be the remake of 1987 Autumn Speech after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel employs rock music as the medium of this film to express his personal attitude to life, where love, desire and consequential frustration play essential decisive roles. Rock music is perhaps not the best vehicle to convey the deep mood, yet it is not too inappropriate to exploit it, as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than a regular one. The director focuses on portraying subtle love and ultimate vanity rather than just rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delicate and soothing delivered through the good performance. Mabel tries not to beautify rock musicians as artists at all, but instead tries to reproduce a true life on the screen, making great efforts for years of work on this project and collecting information in Beijing underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel has given the best performance in all his films so far. His innate discouragement and reticence perfectly match the blue mood of the movie.
