Delightful movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also supports some of the great actors of our time, not just from France, but from everywhere. My Favorite Segments: 14th Arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, arrives in Paris to learn French and also to get a feel for her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: There was probably no better way to start this movie than with this segment of romantic Paris. <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris that we are better aware of since the riots in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's child (she is a nanny) than alone. <br /> <br /> Latin Quartier: So fun to see Gérard Depardieu as "tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Don't tell me you didn't like these mimes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Such a great experience to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist making high-contact (one no) with a girl in the Metro. Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is amazing. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back! <br /> <br /> Viewed in Barcelona (another big city) at Verdi on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
