This is a very good, made for TV movie. It shows problems in suburbia around the 1970s, and the kind of neighbors you certainly don't want to have around. The worst and most disturbing part of the movie was when punk teens killed the family dog. The teenagers do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy !, the protagonist takes revenge on the punk teens in the end. The father / homeowner certainly does not easily take the whole aggravation of the punk teenagers easily and is quick to reciprocate after missing the help of the police. He stands up to them and protects his home and family. A very good actor .. I can add. <br /> <br /> I saw this on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I've never seen it again on TV and would like to. Definitely a good one! It's the kind of movie you can catch on a weekday night very late at night and can't stop watching or afternoon movies on a weekend. That's the kind they just don't show anymore. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing!
