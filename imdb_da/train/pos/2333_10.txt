I recently began to see this show and I have to say it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it along with everything else. Some other people said that this show should have more realistic reactions among the dead. If you want to accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you must accept that the others are completely crazy parts of the show. I couldn't help smiling for every episode I saw. I really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really do well to see. I absolutely love the story, I think it adds the extra bit odd to the whole show. You can't always compare old shows by an author to his new ones, you have to take everything as his own device. Definitely give it a try and just enjoy the ridiculous parts they are.
