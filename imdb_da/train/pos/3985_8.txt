Watched this as a late TV movie last night, purely by chance. The look of the film said something about the mother's stay with the daughter and goes on a romantic journey when I voted in, the carpenter was hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately visible. <br /> <br /> It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter's love interest is also her daughter's boyfriend, so there are brewing problems and not too many surprises. But I had been caught by Anne Reid's convincing performance and I was hooked. The direction gives her plenty of room to stare in mirrors and adjust scarves when she cares. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's body remain covered? Not here, and we are being treated to a delicious revival in the mother's sexuality. Even more spectacular are the drawings, she is made to SPOILER !, Once discovered, confirm her daughter's suspicion that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the cast, but it could be me. With its waves of pre-Raph locks, I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my heart. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did not bring the wrath of the movie's progress. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If goodbye to mother as she leaves in disgrace is so indifferent, then we might see some close-ups of the waving goodbye and see some of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently abandoned widow who leaves the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of sympathy curl. For a movie so full of emotion (and warned it is like opening champagne, you never get the lid back on) the end is a cold contradiction.
