It was a movie I had heard about my whole life that grew up but had never seen it before a few years ago. It's reputation really continued there. I knew about Michael Myers, had seen the mask, then advertising all the crummy sequels that followed. But I grew up over the decade when Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never believed much of the Halloween franchise. Boy how I was cheated by cheap knock offs. Halloween is a really scary movie. Now, according to today's standards, it is not so graphic and visceral, but this movie delivers on all the other levels that most horror movies fail to achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy and the fact that it is in a picturesque, midwestern city is a testament to his ability. The light effects are downright horrible, with "The Shape" apparently appearing and disappearing into the shadow of will. The simple but brutally effective music score only adds to the excitement. <br /> <br /> The performances of all players are well finished with specific nodes to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so sympathetic and vulnerable. It's more scary when she is stalked by Michael Myers because the instructor and viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and get away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis as a man on mission and it works well. He adds a sense of the difficulty the city finds itself in because he knows what evil is closing their streets. All in all, Halloween is not only a great scary movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. This should be the standard view for anyone who wants to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even more frightening time, try to see it alone with the lights off. Don't be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" lurking around in the shadows!
