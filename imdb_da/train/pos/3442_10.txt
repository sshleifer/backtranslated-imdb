This film leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. Nor can I understand why people would destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be suitable for you. <br /> <br /> This movie presents a high degree of realism. The actors and actors' performances are exemplary. Not false, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound.effects, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera work is excellent, the music is oh so good. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. It leaves your body numb like Constant Garderner. It has direct raw talent, certainly not a follower.
