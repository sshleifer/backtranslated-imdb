I liked this movie a lot. It really fascinated me how Deanna and Alicia became friends of such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul, and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that it was a little slow at first and it took a while to get out of things. Apart from that, it was good.
