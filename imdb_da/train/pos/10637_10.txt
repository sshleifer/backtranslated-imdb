Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensually shot and amazingly portrayed, Harem Suare is a bold movie that tackles interracial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the film. Cut off from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy within their ranks.
