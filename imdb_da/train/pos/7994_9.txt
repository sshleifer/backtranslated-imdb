I liked this movie a lot. it's dark, it's not a ball-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. Many characters backgrounds and motivations are a little vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. It's nice to see a movie where the instructor allows the viewer to make their own thoughts. <br /> <br /> Ultimately motivated by love or revenge or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is "right". "Will God forgive us for what we have done?" - It is not a question deadly men can answer - so he does what he thinks he should do what he is good at what he is trained to do. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor - honestly can't think of a bad movie he's done - and he has a great supporting cast. I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.
