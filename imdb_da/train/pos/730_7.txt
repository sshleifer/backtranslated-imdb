I liked this movie, I remember there was a very well written scene in this movie, where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is in her bed smoking pot, and then she begins to visualize that Ramones is in the living room with her sings the song "I want you around" ... very much cool stuff. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I admit that the end is the way over the top and far fetched ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun, it's a very funny movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll Forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that was initially starring in this .. But I don't know if this is true or not
