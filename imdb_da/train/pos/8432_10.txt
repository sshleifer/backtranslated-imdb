I didn't read anything about the movie until I saw it by chance last Saturday night. And when I saw it, I felt Lena and Boesman's misery in my bones. I was so imprisoned by the actor and the tone and the film that I only listened to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed, and I was sleepless under the film's influence. I would wake him up to say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait for the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb and was sorry to learn that Mr. Berry died before the release of the movie, and he probably never saw the last version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that his film was a true independent film, in his concept and in his spirit. The actors must be praised not only for their brilliant performance, but for accepting a lot without shine, without showing themselves, on the contrary, showing the true image of human depression. Sad but dissuasive.
