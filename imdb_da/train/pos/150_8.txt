The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children experiencing violence and isolation in their remote communities develop into troubled young adults who need some mental tools to deal with their hidden mental weakness. Whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting a macho image while engaging as a male prostitute, Villaronga successfully examines how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain during Franco. The three witness the disruptive double-death or their friends before they are teenagers, and subsequently bury the feelings they feel with their peers, until they meet again in a hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The cinematic style of the text is typically visually sumptuous as you would expect from the Spanish author and reminds extremely of fellow Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's work on sexual desire issues, both heterosexual and homosexual. One element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural undertone spliced ​​with claustrophobic, gritty realism against Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The chip gives an insight into worried young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of sexual character. I highly recommend watching this movie as it contains elements that remain with the audience for a significant period of time after viewing.
