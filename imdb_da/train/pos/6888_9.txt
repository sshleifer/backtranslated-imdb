I watch movies for living and choose which ones are good enough to distribute ... Pushing away those who don't make the clip. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this, I just take you to how I came to see "Louise's Gospel" ... Anyways ... So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually sit through them all. In fact, I do not see "everything" I usually look at on the TV occasionally while working on the scan for production value, performance and how well the story is presented. If something catches my eye, I take the time to see it. "Lou" took me in during the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and rolled my chair over to the TV so I could completely tune in. Needless to say, I was excited about the whole movie. The story is told well, the characters are either endearing or repulsive (depending on the character of the course on the actor and the intentions of the instructors for the character) and all very well played. Sometimes I occasionally caught amateur errors in the camera's work and editing, but the emotional nature of history makes these errors easy to dismiss. I heard other people's comments say that the movie sometimes brought tears to their eyes, the second time extreme elation ... I laughed for a minute and cried the next and was incredibly affected by this movie. Unfortunately, I was unable to acquire it, because I was - as I said - a week late and a dollar card. That's how it goes sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this, and I can't wait to see what kind of answer it gets. Good luck to you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are undoubtedly a talent to look for.
