Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egoism, who takes the feelings of others for granted and only thinks of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's boyfriend, who accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional roommate. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions and their implications make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain more of the plot because it is far more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you watch it, you will not be confused. The film is very complex but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
