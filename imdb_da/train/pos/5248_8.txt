Okay, like many other such movies, jumped out of a SNL crap. But Tim Meadows does a pretty great job of making a 3 minute one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comic movie character. He drops entertaining consistently-threatened one-liners with fair frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in it, even though his Lando days are far away and all things are shot pretty well. True, it's not great art, but if you went into Waynes world looking for Gone With the Wind, you did something wrong. Comfortable for what it is .......
