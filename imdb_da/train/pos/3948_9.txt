So finally I know it exists. Along with the other Uk contributors here, I saw this as having what has been the only British screening in the 70s. I remembered the title, but came nowhere when I mentioned it to people. It scared me (it's 2'r) but when you go to bed with a doomsday about your brain and listen around for impending terror, that's not what a truly classic horror movie is about ?? I can hardly remember the film's intricacies, but what I am reminiscent of is my appalling meat and increased senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if someone has any info on how to get a copy of this, please contact ...
