This really is one of the best movies about love I have ever seen. Easily followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which is technically not another movie at all, as it is about the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, it is only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the film leaders. Reading the other reviews, I am pleased to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based films as well. And that's what makes "before sunrise" as well. The dialogue is perfect. It's so right, so engaging and fun. It is hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "you will fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to call their best friends with the other pretending to be the best friend. It's perfect, bringing you back to the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, you should see " Before Sunrise "Before You See" Before Sunset. "If you, like me, first put you on" Sunset, "it's hard to deter the feeling of pity and grief for the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> < br /> Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books, wonderful plays, excellent script and beautiful places.
