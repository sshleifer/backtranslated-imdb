Beautifully filmed, well-acted, closely scripted suspense film. Had me on the edge of my seat. I liked the main actress a lot and thought the villain was very well done. Not much to chew in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn off your brain, watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot, you will have a good time. The reason is well worn, and regular movie guests will probably more or less know what to expect with about ten minutes in. But it didn't disturb me as I enjoyed seeing it unfold. In the old days they may not have focused so close to only two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I hoped they would have some other people have a few lines. But these people probably had the right to keep the film so closely focused. The reason got me by the neck pretty early and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. which I am not sure it makes much sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
