Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T was driving? I look like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The pickup is interesting as it looks like the first truck I drove and recently found someone else like it. I would like to restore the download I should look like in the movie. The music was great too, and the play was amazing. Where and what is the lady portraying John's aunt? Did John also have a stunt double for the stage on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W in this show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks,
