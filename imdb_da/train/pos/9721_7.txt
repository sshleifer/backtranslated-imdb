How to Lose Friends and Aliens People are a decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach. In fact, it's a story about Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) who breaks through journalistic and magazine writing business that is interpreted in a fun way. Simon Pegg made an ok look, a little worse than his usual. Movies aren't fun or fun all the way or something like that, but it has its moments, and those moments are really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching Americans with English cream comedy to all the people who just want to sit, relax and enjoy movies for what it is. If you are watching this movie with critical approach, you must pass unless you will be disappointed and start destroying it.
