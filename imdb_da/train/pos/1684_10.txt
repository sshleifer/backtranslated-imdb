Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% staggered like the one in this movie, then I think he might have gotten worse. Unfortunately, the video printer of this movie contains sex scene bets that were originally shot by the distributor to increase the image appeal appeal. Several times during the film, Milligy's ugly camera work and silent movie music suddenly stop, and suddenly great recordings for Millig's domestic actors over and begin to make it into psychedelic 60s guitar rock. Speeding through is pretty easy if you're trying to pay attention to Milligy's original movies, which unfortunately lack a lot of action cut into space for the extra sex scenes. What remains is, however, still convincing things. I don't think I've ever seen a more hateful mother in any movie before.
