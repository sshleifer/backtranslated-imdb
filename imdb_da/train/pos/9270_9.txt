I have to point out that before reading this review, it is by no means a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about it than hopefully you see that I am against politicians in general ... but If you want to be offended ... I can't help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). It's a shame because the movie is amazing. Wouldn't it be for "Grbavica", this movie would have won at the international film festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Just so (it was runner-up somewhere if you wanted to). Why? Because it is a film of oppression. It is not even that this is a complete women's problem. It's about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banning it, nothing has been solved and / or they can make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a good summary line: "Comedy of a Tragedy" that summarizes it quite well!
