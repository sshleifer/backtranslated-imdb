Also for me this Christmas song is one that I remember very lovingly. In 1989, I picked up the 2 CDs I found out of the soundtrack recording and gave one to my sister and kept the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas graduation now, and I'd love to see the show again instead of just remembering it while listening. It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of performances at the Muppet Show and they did more than one special together. The good report between Denver and his fuzzy companion clearly comes here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
