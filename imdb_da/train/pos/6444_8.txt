The line is, of course, from the Lord's Prayer: "Your will be done on earth as in heaven". Sweden, especially its northern part, is not my idea of ​​the sky -30 degrees C Winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me, but the good folk musicians who live there undoubtedly believe that they are in God's own country. <br /> <br /> The story here is a familiar one. The renowned international musician Daniel suffers from a health breakdown in the middle of his career, going back to the small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help with the church choir, he makes some unlikely talent for a classroom, and they participate in a competition in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (excuses) of the band's players of the "Brassed Off" models of "Calendar Girls" and the dancers of "The Full Monty". But of course, he causes lots of emotional upheaval, as some of the more discouraging villagers realize their worth and rebellion against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious priest, but nothing except death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat corny history, we learn and resemble many of the characters that come across as humans rather than caricatures despite the fact that many of them are recognizable "types". I wondered that the wife-beater was unpunished for so long? Sweden is a country in the world where such violence is pretty much discouraged (he was also a little young to be one of the waves in Denmark's youth), and the puritanic pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but wonderfully realized by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is simply amazing as Daniel, the fragile but driven musician, and there is also good music. I was raped in the two hours. The end is what you do about it, but it doesn't reject it to say that Daniel achieves what he set out to do.
