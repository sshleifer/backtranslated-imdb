Busy Phillips put a hell of a show, both comic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but busy stole the show. It was a good touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which was not so great. If the film does not receive a nomination of any kind for this film, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see the Home Room.
