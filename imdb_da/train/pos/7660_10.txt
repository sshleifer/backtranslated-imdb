This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I can be biased as the Apartheid era is an area I have always felt for. But I want to say it all goes up with Cry Freedom and weep the beloved country. Unfortunately, I have never even heard of this movie a few days ago. Inside is one of the most underrated movies all the time, probably because it was a small movie company, I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his bad role well. Don't look for humor in this movie, there is none. It is genuine, wild and gritty in the end, and to the sensitive, I would say bring a box of tissues. But movies as big as this make you odd, why is it that the biggest movies are often never heard of?
