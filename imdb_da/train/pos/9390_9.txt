This movie started me on a Nick Cage kick. It is a story full of twists and turns â€” a film of motifs and movements. Of course Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect couple to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web. Everything about this movie is good - filmography, history pace and most of all the end. Cage stands out for what he does best - it should not be a hero of action, but a general trapped in the snare of life.
