but I would like to say that I cannot accept more with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I was just thinking about it this morning and wanted to afford some dopey soda that had lost money on his debit card through fraud and wanted to say "Keep your money in your pocket" and realized that I spoke like James Mason. Although he did not say these words, I still think he would! I've never forgotten 'Are you with?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "Always have money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Not enough children have fathers with such unforgiving but well-appointed attitudes more. Or any father. <br /> <br /> It would be a good thing for us to recreate 'you', 'your' and 'yours' in our language to show what we usually do. It is only the same as 'tutoyer' in French or 'you' in German. <br /> <br /> Addendum: I just realized that many of my comments were about James Mason in the Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think that's because I blended Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand by the comments tho '. <br /> <br /> And spring and port wine are as much as Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you took a girlfriend to the pictures these days, you really had something to say and talk about afterwards, something that affects your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real and they are important to help young people grow up. <br /> <br /> It doesn't happen now, I think teenagers can just go to the pictures as we did.
