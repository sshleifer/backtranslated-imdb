I couldn't have been more excited; Just eight years old back in 1983 I had to watch a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. Until then, my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO broadcasts of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> And boy, delivered that day for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green leaf light bulb !! Wow! Since the magic day, I must have seen this movie hundreds of times. I can't even make a precise estimate at this time. Of course, with these multiple views, I've noticed that this movie - the real episode III - has its faults. <br /> <br /> Of course, for a Star Wars movie, these "bugs" are more like "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983 I had mine. And that was my Star Wars movie.
