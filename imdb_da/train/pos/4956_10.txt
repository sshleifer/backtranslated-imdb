This movie is truly genuine and random. It's really hard to find movies like that in herds of movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought his DVD on Tuesday this week, and I've seen it in 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent of Paz, it's just really sweet as she is. And her plays and Morgan are so fun and natural. <br /> <br /> My movie taste may be very different from others, but I have to say I really love this movie, the simple is the best! <br /> <I learned more about life from this movie (well or at least the life of the United States). Life is truly random. Sometimes you meet someone, they pass your life and become your friends randomly, and you do not spend so much time with them, maybe just for a while, but you enjoy it "while" with them and then you and them Never meet again, but the time you are together is truly unforgettable. Just keep these moments in your mind as grateful and fond memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie may be cheap in price, but its meanings are not cheap. I can rarely learn anything from movies, but that is an exception.
