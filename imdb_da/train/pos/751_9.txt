This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and largely ignored because of the general public's misconception about it as a teenage girl. It has amazing performances, especially a battle scene between Jodie and her mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodies friends are somewhat amateurish, but I think it's worth seeing.
