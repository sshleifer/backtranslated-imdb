I love this movie a lot, I saw it again and again. I can't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. Maybe you have seen better or what it is, I love it personally. It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I haven't seen it, and I don't think it's better than this. I don't know why you're all for something, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I've said enough, but I absolutely love this movie and to those who say it's not good Then I wonder why you looked at it and what movies you consider good. As for everyone else that I saw it, they also saw it, so I am surprised that this many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think it's how to spell her surname), she's very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
