I was 16 when I first watched the movie and it has always been a great favorite of mine. Of course you can't deny Kristofferson's appeal in the movie - how nice is that man ???????????? Sheesh. He's still. He's the bad boy every woman secretly wants. His action is flawless. He played a drunk / druggie only the way one who had really gone through it could - and he had - i76 finally he came on the cart so it was just right. The music is BIG, and although in recent years I thought Streisand was something not the right person for him in physical beauty, I think it is more a problem for male viewers than women. We gals just look at Kris - and of course the boys look at the woman's interest - my husband can't see the movie b / c by her - he doesn't like her appearance. But I made him sit through just the red Ferrari scene on the way to the end so he could see how good it was - the camera's work was so perfect and you were in the car with him with the music blowing - you should have seen it on my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the transfer quality was great - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas that are normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> Bringing some good memories from my mother and i love this movie together, i bought a copy for her for christmas .. would have loved to see it with her night. <br /> <br /> I have been trying to pass through the original with Judy Garland but I guess to see this first, I just can't get into the previous era. See the whole concert movie in the '76 version was as much as what I lived on time. <br /> <br /> I work my way through the commentary from Streisand, but she only seems to talk about herself and so far she has almost not mentioned Kris or details about scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds exactly right now. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
