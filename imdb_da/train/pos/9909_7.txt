A serious comedy. Ross Hunter-produced movie version of the French game "Les Joies de la famille" (later American as "A very rich woman") is plush, well thrown, occasionally fun ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, who seems to frighten his money, is being tracked by her two adult, greedy daughters, both of whom fear that Mama Rosie carelessly uses their heritage. The whole question of a vital - but age - woman sent to a home against her will, and later proving herself sane in a lawsuit, is sensitive material to a comedy (and to his credit, director David Lowell Rich does not overload picture with crass gags or obvious mood). Some of the humor is a bit wide and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity of this scenario and never hits a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's grandson, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elderly and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, the gravity of "Rosie!" -The theme is almost lost in the rush to a good end. The picture leaves you smiling - and at the same time wondering how many older ladies are who were never quite lucky. *** from ****
