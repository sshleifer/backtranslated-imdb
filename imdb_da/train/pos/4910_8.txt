This very good movie crackles with excitement. Stakes are of course high - will the police and Widmark, the public health physician, consider the criminals who do not know that they have plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out? But smaller platinum elements introduce tensions into all stages - between Widmark and the police officer between the evil ones played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying, plague-hit man whom Palance mistakenly believes is a hunt because he has smuggled in some valuable goods between Widmark and his wife and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a complete panic. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan, in extraordinarily well-choreographed long shots shot in New Orleans, ending with a stunning climax where Palance flies like a rat from his pursuers through the city's harbors and warehouses. The commentary is fantastic, probably the best I have heard covering filmography, framing and illumination of images, production design, casting of non-professional actors in small roles and irons and parallels in the plot, as an insightful seminar in the 1950s film techniques and films noir in general. See it once to enjoy the movie on your own and if you are interested in film making, another time with the commentary to learn.
