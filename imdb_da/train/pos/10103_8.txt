I've spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I could show it to my kids. The movie is fun, and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the company. They had to be so good at playing that demented. I like it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a century-shift firehouse, with a fitting of misfits, firefighters and the divorce band (when they don't fight fires). There are the usual run gags, plus Mayhem from Spike Jones and his orchestra. Also comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight-man Hugh O'Brien.
