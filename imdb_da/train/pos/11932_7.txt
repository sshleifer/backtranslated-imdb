I watched this movie on TV many years ago, and I watched this movie when I got this on tape. I thought this was reasonably well done. It wasn't the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The act was good, with Danny Glover leading the role. The baseline was not very credible, but the script was well written. This movie may also be of interest to avid baseball fans. It does not apply directly to an action-packed sports film. It applies directly to a great movie that you can watch with your family and learn some messages hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good, but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10.
