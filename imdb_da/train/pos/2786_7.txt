What surprised me most about this movie was the sheer audience, it attracted. Similar movies like Anita and Me have never caused as much hype as this movie has, although I think it's probably more than anything else because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the title. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant movie crossing a brilliant message - you can do something if you're determined to, and think about it, which is such a positive message to anyone who sees this movie. I think it's one of Keira Knightley's better movies, and I think she's a brilliant actress and was great for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately I can't tell Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I don't think he was so much a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant movie and a brilliant story
