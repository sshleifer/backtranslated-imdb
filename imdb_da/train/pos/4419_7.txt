I watched this movie and heard writer-director Juan Gerard speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> Its opening scene will bring in mind "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "Chicken Clucking" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; You will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore who often use a black man as a kind of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and film medium, which he has loved throughout his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard, and all the people in it are real, as they are depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover), but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and advocated producing and staring in it. Keitel keeps the screen strong as the mysterious and secretive grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> True, the film's first half suffers from rigid line arrangement, and some cover, but keep it up. The latter half is much better as the events of the revolution combine to the bittersweet and honest climax. It is Juan Gerard's first effort, but it is honest as he is, and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see it again and hope he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
