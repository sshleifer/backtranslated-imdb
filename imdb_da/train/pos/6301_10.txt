I participated in a filmmaker's symposium, and this film was shown after we had already seen a not-so-big movie and participated in a 40 minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience could really like it. Personally, I thought the movie was fun in all the right spots, and I loved the crooked draft of characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
