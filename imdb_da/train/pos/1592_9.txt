'What I think of you' is definitely a show I couldn't wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress, and I grew up seeing her show: 'The Amanda Show.' She is a very fun person and seems to be down to earth. "Holly" is such a similar person and has an "out-there" personality. I enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down, so she rattled herself at times. But that was what made the show so good. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the show when the "Vince" sign came together. Nick Zano is very HOT and fun, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially loved 'Lauren'; she is the best! She helped make the show extra fun, and you never know what to do or say next! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason I didn't give it 10 was because there are no more new episodes and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
