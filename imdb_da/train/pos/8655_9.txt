"California" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it can easily be described as one of the best psychological thrillers in the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface for it, but behind it are many disturbing and honest portrayals of homicide maniacs and the terrifying violence they inflict on others. One of the movie's strongest aspects is the performances that Brad Pitt is starting great as a trailer trash named Early. Pitt sparks his scary character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is just as good to play her naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "California" has a very simple plot for what goes steadily and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly it bursts into a terrible spree of murder, as Pitt releases his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and it's all mounted to a climate neighborhood that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that really should be monitored for it's intense look at how a human being can be monstrous and not just for his violence and doing.
