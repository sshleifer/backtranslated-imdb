Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies, I have no argument with it, even though there are a few others I thought as entertaining. One thing: It's the longest of the series I've seen in 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them, but it was longer than I've been accustomed to with the drawn action final, I thought it was all too long. <br /> <br /> It's still a good mix of action, excitement and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. The primitive special effects do not disturb me, as it was all they had back in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Amongst some, this movie is best known for one thing: skin! "Jane" never brought anything skimpy for this movie when the Hays Code was introduced at the time of the next Tarzan movie. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan had. The naked underwater scene, however, was not her - by a long shot. The woman under the water had no good figure at all, it was. <br /> <br /> There's lots of action in here. Up to the final, it was also no overdone. However, the end went for 15 minutes and was so intense that it was almost too much to see. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - you I want to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan makes her Tarzan shout about a dozen times. With her couple "lungs" it was no problem.
