Presentation of Lily Mars is a really comfortable little movie that highlights comedy skills actress Judy Garland along with her standard song moments. The plot consists of Lily Mar's marking by producer John Thornway for his great break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
