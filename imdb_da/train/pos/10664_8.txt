Does anyone else tear tears when they see this movie? I love it! One of my top 10 movies at all times. It makes me feel good. I see the final production number with all the cast members over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the Babe of the movie, IMHO! I've never seen the game, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the game was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The film process will rarely deliver a finished product that is true to the original work. I think it is only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen do not change more than they are. This is a very good movie, it is very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
