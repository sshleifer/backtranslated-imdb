As a child I loved computer animation, although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost non-existent. This movie, when I was in awe and saw the amazing images and almost hypnotic music, shaped the desire of me to create moving things in the computer. This is a help package, between music and video that really packs one-two beats. If you know any child who wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE. <br /> <br /> I still rate nearly 20 years later this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. The original I still find unmatched by most of today's McMovies, which Hollywood spits out. At the moment I want to see if I can do it on my own; if imitation is the sincere form of flattery, this movie deserves a TON of imitation =)
