This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you go away, you pretend to know, or you worry about what communism was about, and how true Russians or Britons are, if you accept and are not harmed by the conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and fun. Ben Chaplin succeeds in avoiding being completely out of the shadow of Nicole, and the rest of the throw also works well. The final is in motion, and logical - film logic, of course. Worth to see if you accept the rules of the game.
