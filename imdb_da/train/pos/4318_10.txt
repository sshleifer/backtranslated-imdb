A measure of the magnitude of a film is, if it came to t.v. right now you want to sit and watch it again? My answer to the Grand Canyon is so powerful a "yes" as it would be for almost any movie I've ever seen. There are just so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, so incredible performances. <br /> <br /> It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that was so fierce in the early nineties. But it also dramatically confirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. In a small way, the film was of its time. It partly portrays society as a balloon that is about to break out. Because the country was in a recession and so empty of leadership, it was true for that time. But the film is also timeless. I think it could honestly stand up to any movie ever made and it is the most overlooked movie all the time.
