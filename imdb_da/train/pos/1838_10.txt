WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup, not just for your soul. The meat has unfortunately lost its true taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnish that went into its creation. What is surprising and disappointing about the WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clich√©s of the Hindi cinema in his first venture, but which in turn turns in for all stereotypical movie formulas. While Vipul Shah had the conviction of showing something as impossible as blind men robbing a bank in the GENT, he just fails to evoke life throughout the package of WAQT, which is based on something as imaginable as a father-son relationship. Adopted from a gujarati game Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sensible story with a social message for backup. A mature look at the relationship between father and son, a father's unconditional love for his son and a son's responsibility to his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who has established his entire empire from scratch, leads a wealthy life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never needed to strive for anything, since he got everything tailored and crooked in life. Ishwar's pampering has only spoiled him. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to make his dreams come true. Meanwhile, he is married to his lady hat Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at her best, leading a carefree life. The endurance limit eventually collapses when Ishwar derives Aditya from his house. The sudden change in his loving father's attitude towards him and his now expected wife bites Aditya. He has no option left but to strive for his wife and his unborn child's livelihood. He begins to become an independent man, but the rift in the relationship between him and his father is growing. <br /> <br /> The story is simplified while the uncomplicated manuscript has a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and relate to the credible signs of both father and son. If you are not one of the two, at least you may have encountered people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add it to the director Vipul Shah's easy handling of the manuscript. With a family affair like this, every other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama to the movie, according to the movie films in Bollywood family drama, making the movie an obsession. But Shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Clearly the example of his unpretentious direction can be seen in the pre-interim scene, where the father expels his son from his house in a rather moody way. The purpose of the scene is achieved without merely a brown on the audience's brains. Dito for the stage in the second half, where the now separated father's son has a flipping conversation. This is what differentiates WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA, and actually places it high on the treatment level. <br /> <br /> But having achieved all the distinctions, can you wonder where the WAQT is still in? The problem lies in the fact that even though WAQT differs from the others in the league in terms of treatment, it gives into glitches in packaging. What about the director forcing in song-n-dance now and then in the first half. There is a Johar kinda shaadi song, a Chopra kinda Holi song, a father's son's disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream that is real song that evokes sufficient yawns in the viewer. Picture this ... the father has just extinguished his son from his house and his son dreams of a song in Moroccan mountains with his wife. Misplaced! Without reason! and the audience outside the seat. <br /> <br /> The movie only draws in the first half and the actual story begins only in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary items. The very talked about dog hunting sequence is not bad, but is also not redeeming. But Akshay Kumar's daring dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (accidental) histrionic fun. Add to the climax set at the finals of the Stargazing, where the son breaks out with emotions. It's so archetypal! The editing pattern could also have been reversed to hide the father's justification for the change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is fine but unnecessary in the case. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough, but not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has made some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up or the bright moments in the movie very effectively. While Rajpal Yadav has gone overboard with his comic histrionics in many films lately, this time he emphasizes his character and is completely detained. His deadpan expression is perfectly complimented by Boman's over-the-top histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in her mother's role. Not to be taken as a censor, but she is flawless in both playing and 'seeing' her character. Priyanka is beautiful and performs its part well. <br /> <br /> Of course, it deserves great acclaim, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father deliberately prepares him to alert him to his responsibilities. Though Bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a few scenes, his brilliance hits the whole movie. In summary, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional, but the final recipe is somehow not as much appetizing.
