Honestly, this is the best reality show ever to come up with. In order to win the money, you must actually be INTELLIGENT. Not only that you have to be brave, athletic, clever, etc. It requires actual skill. Not like some lama-ass shows that are these days. And yet they only have two seasons of it! Bull .. they need to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> Although they find it difficult to pull Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was amazing. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was a great show. You never knew who would go when. And it was so much fun trying to figure out the pier itself! It was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BRING BACK MOON !!!! BRING BACK MOEN !!!!
