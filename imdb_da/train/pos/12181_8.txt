"The Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of Hollywood's most troubled productions. Welles' original cut was removed by the producers and cut to ribbon. This made the already confused mystery story even harder to keep track of. They are calling for a good amount of their dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and the duplication is far too clear and badly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his on-screen and the real-life lady Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes on the screen. Fortunately, it is only considered fantastic Orson Welles direction is. He makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to be breathing off the screen. Also characters and scenes are so bizarre, they border on dreamlike and surreal. This sense of discretion raises scenes often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequences in the middle. I typically find courtroom dramas a bore, but Welles direction and quirky touches make them as fascinating as anything else. The end of the carnival is reminiscent of one of David Lynch's almost. <br /> <br /> The action here is also very good. Despite their failing conditions, Welles and Hayworth give both decent performances - however, their interactions are only slightly lacking. Everyone else is amazing and lovely to see for themselves, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai", of course, has its problems, but it is worth looking just to see one of the cinema's masters at its best. (8/10)
