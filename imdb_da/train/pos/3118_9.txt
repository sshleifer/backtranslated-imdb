When I hadn't seen the two previous in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I was a little reluctant to see The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> But it was a very exciting experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what happened because of not seeing the first two movies. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with the Bourne Ultimatum before it was reached! I don't think I've ever seen such an exquisitely made and gripping movie, especially an action movie. Since I'm usually away from action and thriller-type movies, it was such a great news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting movies it takes your attention from the first second to the last minute before the credits. Matt Damon was simply amazing as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his amazing performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now this amazing actor has another to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his films in the future. The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressive movie. Well done.
