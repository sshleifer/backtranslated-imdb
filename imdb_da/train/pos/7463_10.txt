It looks like this movie is polarizing us. You either love it or hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments that said you should just "feel" this. <br /> <br /> Also early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small dabs, so close to the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance you can see what the subject is. Cruises mention that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I think this is a tip for the movie gift. This film is such an impressionist painting. It's impressionist filmmaking! And it is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism, and there are scenes that jump around and no, you will not always be sure of what is going on. But in the end everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You have to concentrate on this movie, but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating too hard on it. After that it is when you have to think about it. If you try to find out when it unfolds, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... "go" with it ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the shows top notch and thought it was extremely unique, wildly creative and spell binding. <br /> <br /> But I don't want to criticize the intelligence of those of you who don't enjoy it. It appeals to a particular taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, and spiritual films, watch it. If you prefer something a little easier, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you do what I described, you will surely enjoy it.
