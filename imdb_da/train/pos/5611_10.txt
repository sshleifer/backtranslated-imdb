I watched this movie at a time when I was joking with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting life alone. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I totally believed in the bad character's psychological degradation inside a paris of eternal building sites, dust, bias, egoism, rudeness, malice and decay. I give credit to Polanski's artistry in his direction, his game and his inevitable script, but I fainted during the terrible final scene and was revived by cognac in the theater's leader. Fortunately for me, my life was not only as catastrophic as this (so far), but I have always had great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and then fully immerse himself in the (false) reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to humanity. This film is the sum of many, many instances of big-acting and big-cast. As some performances were made in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did their own copying in English and French, I heartily recommend that if you are bilingual, to switch the sound from French to English and vice versa during the relevant scenes while watching the grand transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy", which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still has not made it a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Of course, these are the three movies that will make a great boxset.
