I watched this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old at a drive-in theater with my family. I thought it was a lot of fun. . . even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this great movie a pleasure! I saw it again this morning at "Turner South". When I saw it, I was absolutely hugged by laughter! "The Parring Game" is a unique classic from a far away age. If you are too young to have experienced the enchanting period of history that produced this movie, I feel very sorry. There is no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a lovely piece of heaven to "old timers" like me. Having said that, all I can do is respectfully request younger people to refrain from commenting on movies like "The Parring Game". <br /> <br /> Movies like this were made for the generation ahead of the current group of your people. And as such, these movies speak a much different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words, ?? If you don't understand the issues the movie is dealing with, don't bother yourself by offering comments like ?? frankly speaking ?? Makes no sense.
