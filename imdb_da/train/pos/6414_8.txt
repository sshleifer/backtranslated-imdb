I was curious to know how critics responded to this arousing inspirational film so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was appalled to discover that the pompous peanut gallery, our nation's film critics, had given the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten". All I can say is if this movie doesn't move you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same website received a score of 74% from the viewers). Not that the critics are all that matters to me. After all, I cannot think of a more useless, overpaid profession. Some schmo are paid to go to the cinema (what a hard life) and do the same as everyone else on the planet does: forming a meaning. But these chumps have a way to get across which their meaning matters more than yours, and even worse, they love to hate. I give you that this movie is old-fashioned (well except for the f-bombs), syrupy and somewhat predictable ... you know right from the start that Cuba Gooding Jr., depicting the real navy navy hero Carl Brashear, will win ( finally) in every trip simply by the way he comes across: firm and wise; strong will and optimism. <br /> <br /> But his performance and those of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a complex character of several real people) are so strong, so inspiring that you will be on your feet cheering many of the movie's scenes, especially courtroom climax. You have to be a real stick in the mud, not to be moved by these scenes. Like our nation's film critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet-hearted dive student who turns to Goodings Brashear. If anyone has seen "Higher Learning", this character completely rejects that sign. Nevertheless, this confirms what I've always felt: Don't listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspiration.
