Each child experiences a trauma that grows up and each child's active imagination has got the best out of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco ?? from the upcoming Clint Eastwood movie CHANGELING - similar to Henry Thomas circa 1982) the combination prove deadly. <br /> <br /> A lone six-year-old whose imagination kicks into a high gear when he is struggling to learn his scary parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, later "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS : Miami ") suddenly decides to divorce, leaving him to his own units and freeing a new tenant ?? a zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jake gets this seed planted while playing with neighbor friend Dillon (Matthew Josten), giving him a print out of the Internet about the Zombie FAQ. Jake is so confident that you are out to get him ?? and his family ?? He starts eradicating an action plan to protect them before it's too late. Indie newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed ?? blends the domestic drama with frightening grin, but the former (smart) outweighs the latter, with a decent story bred by fine actors. (The Marco is the rare race of children's scenes where he is a CHILDREN and not 'actress' - all his nuances are very clear to the unpleasant, shy, introverted child that many can relate to too. (I can determine). Bridgers makes his cheating man empathetic in the realization he truly loves his son, while Bloom has the harder job of building sympathy as the somewhat defective mother who is quick to feelings of rationality - it does not help when Dillon's mother Ruth (Monette Magrath, similar to Laura Dern) constantly feeding her implicit information, running a wedge between Jake and his father, Magrath also has a hard job making her manipulative character relatively sympathetic, but she turns out in a revealing scene that I do not want to go in detail, but shows why she is the way she is (and more importantly, how she has also influenced her own child). <br /> <br/> The filling agent's subjective camera is also well-employed (many angles shown from Jake's POV at Speech Level or Something Wrong; i.e. Peter's upward shot, carrying his son in the same position while having fun in the backyard, and editing is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan based the personal experience script that grows up and also witnesses the first hand account of a friend who goes through the same situation and how the effects of adult relationships can be harmful if they inflict their fear, anger and stress on their children. Here, the film is very successful in getting its theme across. <br /> <br /> But the horror aids are a little dissimilar to say the least, but the shelf of George A. Romero's zombie film is lovingly shown by Ryan (Jake's mother sleeps in front of the TV as the night of the DEADLY KILLS causes his own belief in the undead to be in their home). The metaphor of a monster that acts as a surrogate for household use may be a bit heavy-handed, but again the child's fear of something under his bed is universal.
