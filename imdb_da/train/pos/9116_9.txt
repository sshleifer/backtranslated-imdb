The idea is a very smart title, the film has a serious tongue in the cheek. But it's so subtle, you don't know how to read it! Make these guys a full blown comedy, or is there anything else going on. The small dialogue the movie has is not very delicate, and it increases the power of the film. If the entire sound was turned off from the movie, it wouldn't actually take anything away from the movie. The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it itself bears the whole story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with the blessing is the feeling of shame. I first say this movie as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what next? Where can someone else see this work? The joint association of art without purpose does not exist here. You can see the intent of the design from start to finish. The use of African music the style that comes with everything seems to be planned and for a reason. The character development is amazing. The casting I think is the strongest aspect of the movie; The characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these kinds of movies, really supporting the development of short films across boards.
