I want to be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a big zombie flick that is full of action, original ideas, good acting, but is also full of bad Zombie effects. Part IV entitled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this will check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
