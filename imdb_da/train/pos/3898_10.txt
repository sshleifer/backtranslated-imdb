Hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind Tour-de-Star-Wars-force (Luke: how strong? Vader: The strength of a little pony) where he, as a master he is, does not even break a sweat, brilliantly saves mascara leakage - and it is with almost 2 hours of whirling path through history, its birthplace, Europe and much more. From Heimlich's in the middle of the night, "I invented a maneuver!" to the British Empire's ".. do you have a flag ..?" and the gods of old death god, "Jeff! the flesh god!" And many more, this is the fish-flop-on-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lung fun. <br /> <br /> And I admit to having passed this video dozens of times over the years as a British transvestite emergence, vogueing on a chair, is a longshot of a rental after all, especially one going back 10 years now. And yet, the material is not only timeless, but almost inaccurate, and making today's day nothing more than an enhanced, more fun / sad version of where we were a decade ago, even though we came to think about it, it may just be random .
