Didn't know what to expect from Van Damme's partner & friend / coach / and his choreographer for most of his films. It was great to see him acting as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Dam's films. Now he is alone. He and his wife do a good team. In this one, Qissi is the director of operations and leads bad guy and he is good. His wife was the author, the producer, and led most scenes that did not require action, she also did a good job of editing the movie, together they did a good job, the story was sensible, the battle scenes were edited well, the leaders were real warriors and so good together - the story came together well and if you can believe it ... not bad language, no sex, just action.
