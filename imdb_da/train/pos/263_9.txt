This was a strong Poirot / Suchet, TV mystery choice. The signs were vivid and well-behaved. The reason and the main setting - a student hostel - was excellent. Yep wasn't anything special, but for me I didn't distract from the story. An important point, many Poirot watchers do not recognize good acting or good characterization. I also think they are pretty tough in their judgments of some of the Poirot mysteries. Finally, I have read some Christie novels - none in recent years - and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset by changes from the novel. Please viewers, consider what is being presented to you on film, not what you think should be there. That said, the Poirot mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and ratifiers wanted you to believe. With the unique exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was fantastic in plot, character and theme, the longer Poirot movies are neither so good nor bad. For the post I have seen all the longer Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, movies without lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. However, the presence is either intrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
