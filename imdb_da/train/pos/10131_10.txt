In the very first episode of Friends sent September 22, 1994 "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate" there is a song that plays as Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line that plays: "If you ever need to keep ".... does anyone know the artist's song or the title of the song? It looks like it's a good song .... I'd love to get a copy of it. Thanks for the help. I'm looking for the album / CD it is on so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have the shows that are available to buy and enjoy this show over and over. It just seemed to be trustworthy ... thank you for the entertainment hours you've given over the years.
