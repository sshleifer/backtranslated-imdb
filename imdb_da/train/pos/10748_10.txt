I must say that the events of 9/11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to address the destruction. I was the one who switched the station on the radio and channel on TV, if there were talk of the towers. I was sick to hear about it. When this was broadcast on television a year and a day later, I shot my eyes out. It was the first time I was crying since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I see it now on television, 5 years later, and I still cry over the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only video images of the first aircraft hitting the tower is fantastic. It was an accident and see where it got them. These two brothers make me have been there to help.
