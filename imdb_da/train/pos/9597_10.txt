This is a must-see documentary for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for the real life adventure and its sense of morality. Darius Goes West is a great roller coaster of a story. We live the lives of Darius and the crew as they enter the journey of life. Darius has Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy, a disease that affects all the muscles of his body. He is limited to a wheelchair and needs around the clock. So how could this herd of young friends possibly manage him on a 6,000 mile round trip to the west coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they handle unthinkable challenges along the way and enjoy the final triumph when they return three weeks later in their hometown to a rapturous reception and some great surprises!
