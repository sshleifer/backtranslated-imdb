This is really a fantastic unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s. This movie was dependent on the actor's talent and it was pulled off. It even had a comedy in it, but it wasn't overdone. Once in the Life It's a crime drama that's supposed to be, not the typical special affecting waste with sex thrown in. I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all. <br /> <br /> Now on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was great at playing a career petty criminal. It's a pity that he only has to show his talent in his own movie. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's junky half brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly seasoned film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat loss / lord. I loved his play since "King of New York". But the best movie in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were the couple perfect as two of Calderon's minions. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime, it's probably a goalie. **** 1/2 * out of *****.
