I was drawn to this movie the moment I saw an example of it at Oscar Night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for a comeback kid. I understand that this film was a great drawing in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate on the reason. Perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that Lena character does at the start of the film and other social comments, but perhaps it is because of the central message that I think has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie for me is the same as the movie Titanic. Life is short people, and as far as anyone really knows, it's all we have. It can be taken away anytime. So is it not a shame that we spend so much time hiding behind walls that separate us from other people because we are so afraid of being hurt? Demolition of the walls is painful, but it feels alive on the other side of the miserable walls. Feeling alive is worth taking the risk. Give and you will receive. So start now NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this movie because it lacks characterization and other errors. I'm saying you're all pseudo-sophisticated. Take a grip, it's a parable, a fable for welfare westerners who are materially rich, but whose souls are in poor poverty. <br /> <br /> Then bring a choir or band or help build homes or distribute food to the less fortunate than you. Spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you come out and communicate with your fellow man. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social species by the way. Even the most modest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Robust individualism has its place, but it is overstated.
