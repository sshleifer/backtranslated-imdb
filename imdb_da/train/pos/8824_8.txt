A woman Mujar (Marta Belengur) enters a restaurant one morning at &: 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in the restaurant and makes them act a song in this weird, yet fascinating short film that I only saw by finding it on the DVD of the director / author's equally fascinating "Timecrimes". It had a rather catchy song and somehow it brought a smile on my face despite the gloomy overall plot for the short. I'm glad I stumbled across it (didn't realize it would be an extra when renting the DVD) and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> Min Degree: A-
