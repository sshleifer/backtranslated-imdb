Yes this is a B-grade horror. But at least the producers, the directors and the casters do not pretend that this flick is manna from heaven. The reason is corny, a psychotic serial killer on the way to execution is sprayed with genetic acid that makes him a snowman. Snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost then goes on a murder campaign to find the small town of Sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to deal with limited special effects, most of the money seems to have spent on the snowman's costume. Particularly difficult shots are controlled by cartoons or panoramic images (shots where the camera moves away to hide the details). <br /> <br /> This is no child's movie and should not be confused with Disney movie with the same title. If you don't let your kids watch pg-13 movies alone than parents, they shouldn't let their kids watch this movie. This film has two fame requirements. 1. The beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major film role. The scene where Jack Frost is attacking Shannon Elizabeth is worth a look a few times. 2. This movie has the worst snow joke ever. The wit is so bad that the executives credit the joke counter in the credit list.
