Indian directors are having a hard time. They have to compete with films like "Laggan", where 11 henpecked, castrated men defend their village, and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", an effortless, feasting foreign rendition that drinks into oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors that are unaware of one's feelings or feelings - alas they live in an ornate bias of red tapestry and side pressure. But to make a good movie, pull the front legs, which are the giant gapers that are fascinated by Split skirts and the Dishum-Dishum battles, which mainly involve a nitwit "Bollywood" leading actor who is marginally beautiful. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a story about Leonine village head who, in his own words, "defends his village" is considered a violent movie or masculine for a male audience. There are very few players who can convey anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you in his yard and sees him berated and mocked the politicians when his loyal admirers burst into laughter with every word of satire thrown at him while his daughter bathed his grandson. This is as authentic a scene as you can get in rural India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old play, which is a vanishing race in Hindi Films. The depicted violence is a complicated part of the narrative story with song and dances thrown in for gawkers without whom movies will not sell, a sad but true state. Faster this changes better to "Bollywood". All said and done this is a good movie.
