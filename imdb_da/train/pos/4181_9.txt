It has been so long since I have seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it still battles me with a vivid picture of the horrific consequences prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts is trapped in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mission to set mines in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as other POWs but to their dismay, they soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies when they were out of uniform when they were caught. The consequences of such a violation, with Japanese fighting code, are execution by protecting. <br /> <br /> Despite their pleas and the pleasures of the sympathetic prison guard, the day of government approaches as a ticking time bomb. The excitement is so high that you will actually hear the bitches, although it may just be your chest bound by the percussion of a marching execution group. The end is actually too painful to resume in my head much less write it here. But I can promise you - you will never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the United States
