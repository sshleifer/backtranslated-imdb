A young man named Court is loved by everyone. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer together. You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. Whether it is predictable or not, and regardless of ecclesiastical belief, it is a moving story full of environment and sensuality. Another thing someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that it didn't seem plausible. But the elements for this are subtly set. Note what his mother says about bringing his lunch to the field. Note how he holds the wheel and his gloves. He is sweaty and runs dangerous equipment. To this day, tractors are quite dangerous.
