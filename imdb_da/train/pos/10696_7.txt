Every time I see Nicole I like her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just don't give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. First movie I remember watching like this was Of Human Bondage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beefs about the accuracy of the Russian spoken in this movie are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anyone else who can't speak Russian, I'm sure. Fun how people miss the point. The Russian guys from No-Goodnik were also well thrown. Finally, I have to tell my hat on Ben Chaplin, as another remarked, he plays a juice with great dignity, and there was certainly some heat between him and Nicole. Thinking, boys are being paid for it, thinking.
