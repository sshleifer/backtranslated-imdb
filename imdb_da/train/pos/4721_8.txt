Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot. Brady is shot down over occupied territory. The local ranchers extended him kindness and protection to the detriment of their own lives. I had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours. After the film is over, I'm glad I took the time. It's a whole story told to explain the look of Brady's face at the start of the movie.
