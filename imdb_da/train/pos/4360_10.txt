In this grim melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in France. Threatened with the danger of losing the sumptuous family home, Big Sister makes a big sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so she can inherit her ... the fortune of the aunt. A few years later, she learns that he is after the family's property and wants to tear it down so that she leaves him and tries to stop him. More time goes by and the man ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has carried him a son without telling him. The part of "Gig Young" was played by the actor Byron Barr, who later adopted the name before becoming known. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in buying a copy, let me know by writing to me at: iamaseal2 @ yahoo. com
