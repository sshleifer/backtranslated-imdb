Reese Witherspoon's first movie. Loved it. The ground and the play were top notch. You are emotionally involved in the characters. In my opinion, one should see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you'll see why Reese Witherspon's plays have been so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a good job. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. There is not a dull moment in the whole picture. The man in the lunar length is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent. I have seen it many times and have enjoyed every view.
