Ever since I remember and I am only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey doesn't make me wrong I love the movies we just have today not as much as I love movies from the 40s and 50s) Anyways, now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie, my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course, my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The kids ... didn't work like kids at least. But there is good reason to have had to save and run most of your life and see the horrible things that the children saw the days destroyed their innocence. So people say "oooo I hated how the kids acted ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw things children shouldn't see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did a great job !!! Now I know that many people are crazy about not going to Oscar and Bogie, but hey, they both did great jobs, so I think it could have gone either. But Luke's performance was so amazing that at the end of the film I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone !! :-D
