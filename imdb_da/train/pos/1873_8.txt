The violent and rebellious twenty-five sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) is sent to three sessions for evaluation by the navypsychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) after another outbreak and aggression against a superior ranked marine man. Reluctantly at the beginning of the treatment, he is confident in Dr. Davenport reveals his childhood and reveals painful trauma generated in his foster home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love with each other. By solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to an ordinary life. Denzel Washington's direction is excellent, making sensitive, attractive and with good taste, a story of child abuse. In the hands of another director it can be a very heavy story. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Returning to Live')
