Lost is not the biggest television show in history, but it's not far away. It does not have the plot or characterization of the West Wing or possibly even early ER, but it is probably the most continuously poignant show I have all across. I love the way I can't guess what will happen. I love to tell about the characters' back stories, which often give rise to new dimensions so we can see them. In some ways, I want the show to last forever, but I think they can get 6-7 seasons out of it before they finish it at a glorious height. The combination of the characters and their nationalities combined with the show's fluid ability to move backwards and forwards, thereby spreading dead characters "longevity", all add to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different to what we are used to. It's captivating, surprising and (here's a little suggestion to all your conspiracy theorists) more than a little interactive - keep these internet discussions going - you're just adding to the plot ...
