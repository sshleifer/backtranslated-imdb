In a word ... amazing. I was not so keen to see Pinjar when I thought it would be another movie that complained about the partition and would show disruption to India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a heartbreaking, emotional and intelligent movie with no visible errors. I was haunted by it after seeing it. That long in my mind so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotions - everything was so right. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that you will rarely see in Bollywood today. It has no disturbances or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is portrayed so well or badly. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistani. The kinematics are excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the actor just took the breath. Everyone was perfectly cast. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie ... you no longer see. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. FANTASTIC cannot describe how excellent it is.
