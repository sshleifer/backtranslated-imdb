This is an OK fit, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally okay, but I found Jeremy Northam pretty wet as Mr Knightley, especially when compared to Mark Strong in the TV show. Gwyneth Paltrow is ok and her English accent is pretty good, but again I preferred Kate Beckinsales Emma. There are excellent support arrangements from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often played too much for grin, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-gags here, and also Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent. My biggest criticism is nature. It's all too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do that. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, I enjoyed this movie, but would recommend the TV adaptation more.
