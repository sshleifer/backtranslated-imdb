Eddie Murphy spends her time looking for lost children, so when a very special magic kid is kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help in saving this child from the very links of evil. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, it never feels completely corny despite the comedy's hilarity throughout the movie; Charles Dance off-sets the comedy with its very serious and dark characterization of the evil that keeps the baby's hostage. <br /> <br /> The golden kid is very fun, action-packed and really quite convincing in a charming, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Perfect for all generations.
