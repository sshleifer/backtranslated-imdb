In Carmen, Saura again seeks to create a dynamic report between reality and fiction between the personal passions of the personalities of a dance team preparing the choreography of the dance section of opera Carmen and the written passions of the fictional Carman history, the famous deadly mix of one free spirit (read disregard for allegiance) and her ability to drive men sour on desires. Saura used the same vehicle fiction / reality in a former black and white movie, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tensions between the dancers responding to Blood Wedding proved beneficial to how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story that had to be done by directing their feelings into their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the petty, libidinous Callings from the dancers of the Troupe during rehearsals and the spirit that throws along with the mythical Carmen never come close to being credible. It remains a gadget, and therefore it is a nuisance distraction. You really need to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it is hardly anything that the melodrama Saura tries to impose on his Carmen, because flamenco dance and guitar music by the rehearsals, which is 95% of the film - by some of the most famous Flamenco dancers and musicians, more than repay the price of entry. A fake movie and a wonder: perfect for making a living in Keats' negative capacity, maybe?
