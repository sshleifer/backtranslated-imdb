I must admit that in the first half hour of this movie I was pretty much lost. There had been some mildly funny humor, but at best a barebone's plot and a general sense of meaninglessness that was on the verge of making me believe I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I enjoyed this. There was no dazzling cognition and no sudden dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, nothing exciting happens throughout the film. It was as if I suddenly realized that the movie was supposed to be pretty pointless - and it was in its very meaningless charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman starred as a named actor who finds a "small project" to jump on her career. He has to play a supermarket manager and spend the day in a neighborhood supermarket to investigate the role. As he meets and binds with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more out of life. He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she is auditioning for a role while introducing him to real life. It's really fun to see "him" (because that's how the character is identified in the credits) being overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target Store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great along with a weird but totally credible kind of combined romantic but father-daughter chemistry. If you feel lost in the beginning, you must stick to this. In the end, it turns out to be a lovely charming movie. 10.7
