This is a nice, creative film. From the use of the actual villa, which inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s for the inspired casting, each choice was just right! The silent joy of this movie is not obsolete after repeated views. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
