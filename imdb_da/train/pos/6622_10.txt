I went straight to a screening of the film under Expresion a Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film rolled and from the first shot I was amazed: a long continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in brilliant black and white. I should not go on with the details, because I think it is worth watching. The sci-fi story can be seen as the average for many ... for me it was really good. The action is amazing, the camera is free to fly anywhere, and I mean everywhere. Things you couldn't do or see, are done beautifully. The throwing performance is good, in my opinion no one goes in the wrong tone. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing I found amazing is the animation. 3D graphics see 2D. A BW cartoon brought to life. The details in the background give more texture as if it had been done by hand (I'm sure it was but when the angles change you, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The screen producer talked about the hard work behind the movie: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite inexperienced as he only had a short film in his CV. So many people had true faith in them. They started their own study from scratch and ever since they face the challenge they brought about them. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. I think you won't regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the last look of this movie is better than his, I think.
