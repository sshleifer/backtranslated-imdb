May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for historic appointment with Mussolini. Motions, tensions and forms of self-awareness. an empty town, a housewife and a journalist. Meeting in two different worlds. Refuge to a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classic victim. A story of loneliness and silence. About the shape of the hooks of life and desire as the form of the battle. The great character - a book gifted in a spring afternoon. This film is a poem, remarkable for the art of describing shades of common loneliness. A speech for an inevitable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, Antoniet's clergy, Gabriel's patience and weak tension, the art director of giving the shield's grace to two great actors make this movie sublime, a taste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film of hypocrisy and arbitrary judgment, of the essence and disgust of life for everybody tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent play. A clear masterpiece.
