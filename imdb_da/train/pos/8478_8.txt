I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished ending ... I grew up in many beautiful animated films and it was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story of injustice and cruelty and loneliness and life and choice that can not undone and the need for others. Chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him into the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, although every night he says: "Maybe I eat you tomorrow." The tape on what I have been broken and broken from age and use. I will repair it and watch movies again one day and cry as hard as I did as a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complicated meaning are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never experienced any catharsis beautifully made. I'm glad I've seen this movie and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
