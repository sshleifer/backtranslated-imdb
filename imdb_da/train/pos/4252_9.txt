This movie takes you inside itself in the early minutes and keeps you to the end. it has a very humane history and very good chosen music. The action of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored with action movies and want to watch a good movie.
