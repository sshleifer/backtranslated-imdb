This movie is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all of your people out there who rate this movie make characters because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, it's ridiculous and says a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! You see Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action is not so much focused on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compares it with other American films from that era and later you realize that Jackie Han's film had the best fighting situations and not really good spots, while American movies had good plots, but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan did at that time. Porn is looking at the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the action, I think you people are poorly rated because there is no plot because you think it is how a smart film critic would judge a good movie, but it The way I see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure the middle of the movie was drab, LIMITED, but put it that way the rest, there are all action scenes and stunts much pay for all that. This changed the way American action films were created, they even stole scenes from this movie. If you want a true man, then a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more by Jackie Chans, hes clean in all. He literally makes American movies as a walk in the park, and even today movies. American movies depend so much on special effects and security cables and stunt doubles and so much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan movies are works of a true entertainer who just goes out and is very talented in what he can do. A masterpiece
