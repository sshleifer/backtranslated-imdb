A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from the director at a festival, I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a little shaken and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe my judgment colored, but I must admit that I liked this movie. Standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the protagonist, kind of pathetic in a sympathetic way. Adam Jones (who also instructed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates running Ernie food. The Bill sign (Justin Lane), which uses a lot of the movie dressed as a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after looking at the DVD. Really kind lovable and very fun. Some of the other actors were good, some were so-so, but none of them were bad. I also liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and fun. <br /> <br /> I give this a high rating, although it has some problems because you can tell when you see it, these people cared and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and the crew.
