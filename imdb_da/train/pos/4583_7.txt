I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the sub-grades were grossly over-achieving. This took away from the movie, just like the quite lame musical score that really inspired me throughout the movie. If the musical score was improved, I could overlook the few superstitious scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.
