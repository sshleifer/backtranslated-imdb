Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness, which he explored for such a great effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in the Tenant. The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - dark, embroidery, uncomfortable - but there is something awkward about this movie, and I'm not sure whether it is conscious or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do justice here. As his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed with how few examples of truly impressive filmography are in the movie. The only thing that really gives the movie down is the actor. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can chew with Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the supporters are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as landlord and Shelley Winters as a concierge, but others are weak and miscast. It's also hard to get by that all these Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the movie. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers know that Polanski is definitely a good comic actor. But there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and inexplicable) 'transformation' is more likely to travel giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. All in all, the tenant is an enjoyable and exciting experience if it is a little too dull for his own good. There are a handful of unusual chilling moments and a consistently unpleasant and preventative atmosphere, but this movie, while very good, doesn't hit the mark as well as it could. <br /> <br /> Oh, at the end of the day, an "okay" Polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth seeing, just don't expect to be blown away.
