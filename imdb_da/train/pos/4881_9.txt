"Kaabee" depicts a woman's hardship in before and during World War II and raises her children only after her husband's "crime of custody" jail. This movie was directed by Yamada Youji and, as expected, the atmosphere of this movie is truly amazing. Although the historical accuracy of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is a suspicion. The action in this movie is incredible. I am amazed how they managed to bring this star star into a movie from 2008. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated, still active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this movie. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also nice. However, it was Asano Tadanobu who delivered the most impressive performance, and well portrayed his character and difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Pre-war movies are not my thing, but thanks to wonderful governance and action, I was completely absorbed in the story. It was also not a far left nonsense as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examines the controversial and sensitive problem of government repression and brainwashing that took place during that period in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended for all viewers.
