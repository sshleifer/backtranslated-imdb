In 1991, the release of the two best successors of all time was: TERMINATOR 2: DAY DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Out of the two I've always wanted BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a little better. TERMINATOR 2: DAY DAY, it's better done, but there's just nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it is difficult to think of a larger comic duo than Bill and Ted. They are outstanding. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by National Lampoons O.C. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo during performance at a local theater in L.A. back in the 1980s. The two quickly began to write a play about two and long ago BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, became a great box office success and an instant cult classic. It was not long before the work began on the successor. Stephen Herek, the director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" was not keen to work on the sequel when he thought it was too mediocre and unlike the first, so Peter Hewitt, who made his feature film debut, was brought in to lead the sequel. There could not have been a better director of the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is wonderfully geared. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that cannot be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best followers ever is that while it's darker than the original, it's just so much fun. It does not change the characters that most followers do. Bill and Ted are the same beloved characters as they were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original authors. Most followers are not written by the same authors as the first, but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same writers, it became as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE', if not even better. Like the first, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is fun, well written, fun and above all original. It's full of spectacular special effects and amazing comic performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable 'journey'. 10.10
