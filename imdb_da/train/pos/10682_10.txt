Some years ago, the satellite channel highlighted U.K. Gold repeats of 'Men's Behaving Badly' with hype: "Here's the original flat-sharing sitcom!". This was actually untrue. 'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Far Dear Father'. When it ended, they decided that they wanted to do something more in harmony with time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) clear their Myddleton Terrace apartment after a wild party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a Southampton cookery student of no permanent residence. While his clothes dry out, he puts on a women's dress and prepares them a meal. They are so impressed with his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no cheeky business. So Robin must pretend to be gay ... At B.B.C.-2's 'In Love 1973', shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a lifestyle she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic (to me, anyway) pictures of the '70s British television was Sally Thomsett, who came out of the London Underground and carried a parasol, and a' blind 'man made a double take as her pert lower leg passed. <br /> <br /> A man living with two girls was a risqu√© item at the moment, but Mrs Mary Whitehouse didn't need to get warm under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan still played 'Bingham' in I.T.V.'s 'Doctor In Charge' when this started. In fact, the second round of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sexman Robin. Paula Wilcox 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett 'Jo' was a gracious dizzy blonde. As time went on, he became almost like an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> Too many viewers, Brian Murphy and the Yootha Joyce stole the show as the Warring Ropers. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred didn't. They went on to their own show - the appropriate title 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was good value as Robins bredeboy friend Larry. He worked so well that he was made into a regular. <br /> <br /> Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie-spin-off. I'm not a big fan of the "Man About the House" movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never come in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' with a sense of late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothes. After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy with Robin's older brother Norman (Norman Eshley). Fans were destroyed to see Robin fail to get the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in that he also landed his own show - 'Robin's Nest'.
