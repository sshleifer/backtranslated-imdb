One of my best movies ever, maybe because I was well into the punk scene in the late 70's and went to many of Hazel's concerts, but the movie was a good story and very good play by hazel and an up and coming Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders !! Excellent performance by many unknown actors who, if you keep their eyes peeled, will see them in many of the British soaps today: Carver out of the bill, the more I see it, the more I am instead if you haven't seen it have another night in with the video, do not forget to dig the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head Mochanian style .... Enjoy
