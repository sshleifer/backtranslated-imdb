A young girl who survives as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> An inexpensive hustler who wants to get the big score. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. You can think of the opening titles, it becomes a fierce movie, but it is also a story of love with two people in their own struggle to make the money a better lifestyle. This movie feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes in images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It is not an original joke, but it is well told" says a sign, and this also applies to: We have seen the story, but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, the photograph goes from one colored to a multicolored place. And it captures the city as a cage of these imperfect people. There is also a good use of the music for the dot acts.
