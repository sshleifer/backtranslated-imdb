John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank consultant who lives in a small town not far from London. Although the internet he contacts a Russian bureau of brides. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman? The guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, right?) And when they met, he realizes she doesn't speak English. The communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again imagine what a terrible situation for the guy, just get some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, the two Russian friends visit her for them. Then there will be many surprises. I liked this movie: first, it's almost impossible to be 'labeled'. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I think all choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: does she speak Russian in a real accent, or just fall? Anyway, I found it an enjoyable movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Beet")
