Some may feel that the rating I have just given is a little generous, but for what this film is, I think the directors have done a good job with what they had available to them, it's also a movie a movie with an acquired taste! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult movie 'The Thing', ie. the parasitic aliens from out of space, attacked human hosts and then snatch chaos wherever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this movie pays tribute to such a movie and other horror / gore genre, but wisely mastered its own originality, well these things are fighting each other for one and then continuing to eat so fallen rival! Just kill and pick a human when it needs a new host! Choosing Another Match With Another Infected Host! And this movie throws itself into a love story, but I don't want to say no more otherwise it gives too much away. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But just as I said about an acquired taste, don't be surprised if you don't like the movie. It's low budget and yes it's bloodthirsty, with creatures / foreigners / things morphing their limbs into unusual-looking weapons, ie. misses, exercises, knives and even the odd gun for everyone, but decimates that opponent. I found myself ringing on what I was shown, but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like gore, you like foreigners, you like to fight and even maybe a little love thrown into a place so I have to recommend this movie as one should see. I just wish I came across this earlier then I did it!
