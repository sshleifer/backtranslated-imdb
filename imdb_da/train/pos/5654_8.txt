I saw the show 10 years ago and loved it !!! Now in possession of the DVD and looking at the series waiting for scenes I knew was in the show (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house) and realized it was missing - suddenly I saw the seduction without the management up. Then I went in line to check out all the star's BIOS and came across the comments that the show was out of order. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments indicate "Strangler number 19 and Triangle 20 when someone else had them reversed. And also Potato Boy 5 and Dead to World 6 were also reversed. Can anyone clarify ?????
