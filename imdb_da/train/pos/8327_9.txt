This was a great romantic comedy! Historically incorrect (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors. The Support Aids (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on the screen and made this a great experience. The fact that he was driving a car to get around seems to contradict all the pictures and posters of him driving a bike to get around. And he had socks in a scene ... Mr. Professor never had socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it a 8!
