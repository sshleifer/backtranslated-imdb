Well, I disagree with the other comment posted. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or any of the other films mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially for non-genuine characters, I think someone just wrote it only because he never lived in the Spanish community like I did (and I'm not Spanish), is a very real movie with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> Being a European movie unlike an American movie, well we different societies, personally I don't like American modern movies much (I like the classics and some of the Andy American movies, but they are very few). Is a movie about the continued constitution of a person likes or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn about the mistakes.
