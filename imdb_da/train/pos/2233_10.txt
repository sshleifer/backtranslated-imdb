I first saw this movie back in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You won't be sad. It is well acted out, so genuine and never a dull moment. The action is amazing and the location makes the movie seem like you are there. From the very beginning to the end, this film is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actor does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrible plane crash in the Amazon, and it shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon all alone. It's amazing that someone could survive in such circumstances. That's why this movie is so appealing. That this is a true story makes the film even more interesting and to believe that a young girl could survive from this trial is overwhelming. I find this movie one that I can see again and again and one that I never get tired of. This is actually quite a compliment as I have hundreds of movies! I'd say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
