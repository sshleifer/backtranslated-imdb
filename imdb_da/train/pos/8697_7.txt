Often, loud fun games on sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills milks laugh more out of the post code than it has been since Granny and Jed Clampetta's days. Plot centers on two drivers who have bet on which of them can sleep their employer (both single or soon to be single ladies, quite sexy - Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will pay his debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he'll have to play the bottom man for his friend! <br /> <br /> Lots of raunchy dialogue, pretty sick physical humor, etc. But much of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual or family member who ends up taking his sexy teenage niece for a year-long "missionary trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Hilarious fun.
