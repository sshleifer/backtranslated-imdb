I really liked this movie, I saw the original classic a couple of times, but could hardly remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the comic, it's not as black and white as it is. I especially liked how they made grinning such a complete character and gave a reason why he was the way he was, the villain in this movie was not the real Grinch but the Major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for that part all a great movie made for both children and adults.
