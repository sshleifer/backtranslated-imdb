Very nice action with a interwoven story that doesn't actually suck. Interesting enough to deserve to see instead of skipping to get to the good parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps to experience it too. Jenna in that jersey and the glasses are just amazing! Worth picking up to see her!
