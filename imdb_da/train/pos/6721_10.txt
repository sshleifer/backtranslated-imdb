If it was possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport - no, the pure lifestyle - to surf to its perfect shape, this documentary has done so. This documentary shows that life is not just about the waves, but it is about the peoples, the pioneers and the front of the present, pushing the envelope of great wave longer than it has ever been. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from my early 80s skateboarding days as a SoCal teen - has edited reams of great stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just one documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and clearly it is here - his genius is filled with a pure vision that does not glamor, hype or sentimentalize his subject. He respects surfers and surfing / beach lifestyle, but not laundering it either. There is also a greedy reality for the sport. There is so much that can be said about this documentary, about the surfers, the early history of the sport and the wild big wave surfers it profiles. Greg Noll, the first great wave personality who was certainly groundbreaking for the sport; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who was driving almost alone for 15 years on northern California's extremely dangerous Maverick's great surf; and the centerpiece of the documentary Laird Hamliton, the great wave surfing is today's messiah. There is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys - and a few girls coming up on the camera - and a deep and strong love of surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word. I found the story of how Hamilton's adopted father met him, and how Hamilton as a small 4 or 5 year old boy almost forced him to be his father especially heartless (and again removed by syrupy sentimentality). <br /> If you like to surf - or even if you don't - it is a wonderful documentary to be monitored only because you are a student of the form or a person who simply appreciates incredibly well done works of art.
