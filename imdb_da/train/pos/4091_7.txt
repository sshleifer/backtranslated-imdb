I watched this movie in a cinema in London in 1975 and haven't seen it since. I found it fun. I loved it's originality. It is rare for anyone to make a movie like this - and it is also sad. What I mean is, I once read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan, I always "picture" books as movies. Kinda "customize" them, do you know? But when I read it, I thought it would make a good movie - but of course it should be "adapted" - to the point where it would carry a small relationship with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought well why? Sure, it could never be shown on Sunday afternoon television, but provided it was shown in cinemas for adults who knew what it contained, where is HARM? Dammit, my bourgeois freedoms were crushed here. An instructor MUST be able to make a literal movie adaptation of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult censorship should not exist. But unfortunately, while accepting it from INTELLIGENT adults, such freedom can be harmless. There would always be those who would lack the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and who could be incited to commit evil actions. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into that category. <br /> <br /> On the look of England, the British censor rejected it out of hand. Despite the '69 nudity relaxation, given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality, the censor had passed some of it, he had been looking for a new job Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days there was an alternative. G.L.C. This was a local council with a department empowered to pass a film straight to London, where it was considered the audience, was more "soprano" than those who lived in the founders. <br /> <br /> The movie was duly submitted and passed. However, it later turned out that the "board" consisted of only four people - three who voted, plus a "chairman". And on the day one of the voters was sick. Thus, the remaining two voters and the chairman set out to see "La Bete". <br /> <br /> Like me, one of the voters thought the movie was fun and could hardly encourage evil acts by anyone. The other lacked imagination and simply believed the piece disgusting. And the chairman did not understand, so decided to fail at Freedom. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was too late! The film had received its "X-London" certificate and opened for mixed reaction. G.L.C. film censorship board dissolved soon after! Thus, "La Bete" was only opened in London by what could best be described as a FLUKE! But I'm happy about that. It is well! If you haven't seen it, do it. It's a FANTASY, and as such, it's far less worrying than most things you see on the news these days ...
