*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11-year-old son and was happy to see that he was laughing at the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. Ron Ely's just like Doc. Cold, calm, almost always in control (and with occasional blink of an eye). What more can you ask for? I've never read a Doc Savage book, so I don't know if it's true in the source, but I enjoyed the bright tone and the derring-do. Many people have compared this movie to the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair. The difference in the budget is amazing (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive placement work that Raiders has. Special effects are also at a minimum, but come on people, the story is very fun and humor is just right. The sousa music is captivating (love the theme song - Every time I watch the movie, I stop to lobster the theme for days). The best way to approach this movie is to just RELAX and enjoy. Highlights are the exciting opening sequence where the amazing five and Doc chase the Indian sniper across the rooftops of New York and the very fun fighting sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is the villain who sleeps in a giant manger (really!). All in all, a good movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you gentleman he's here!
