EDMUND LOWE (reminds me of Warren William) leads the beautiful cast of an interesting little mystery moving at a fast pace and running just over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to be intent on his own death (hypnotism, who?) and the suspects include a good number of the supportive cast - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, Nat Pendleton is a dim white detective - and also gets a load of the art deco set decoration for the fancy interior of a wealthy home. Must have been a set that was used in many subsequent films. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable certainty not to be too confused. It's suddenly clear for detective Philo Vance - and then he has a final confrontation with the killer, giving the film a beautiful five minute untouched excitement. <br /> <br /> Beautifully finished and passing the time in an entertaining way.
