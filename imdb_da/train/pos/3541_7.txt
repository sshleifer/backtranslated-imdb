It was originally supposed to be a movie that Gene Kelly wanted to star in, but as the makers couldn't get him, they got "the greatest actor in the world" and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has trouble doing what he does best, creating a high stakes crap dice game because he needs $ 1000 to get space. To get the money he needs he has a $ 1000 bet with the old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can't get Sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations' Golden Globe winner and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also with Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Slice like Big Christmas. An interesting romantic comedy musical, with Brando singing all his own songs, and Sinatra is smooth and cool. It was nominated Oscars for Best Art Direction Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge. It was nominated for best film by any source by BAFTA and it won the Golden World for Best Movies - Musical / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on the 100 biggest movie stars, he was number 11 on the 100 largest sex symbols, he was number 4 in 100 years, 100 stars - men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 in the world's greatest actor, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 in 100 years, 100 songs for, the movie was number 23 on the 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 36 on The 100 greatest musicals. Very good!
