This is a great end to the show. At Adm. Janeway was able to make a double contact at Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected and thus infected the queen with a "poison", which in essence ended Borg was great. The way they ended up also left some, not much, for a reunion movie. But they bring them "home" and the way they did it was amazing !! It was sad to say goodbye to part of my family. Finish it with Tom and B'Lanna with their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some sort - just to see where their characters would be today.
