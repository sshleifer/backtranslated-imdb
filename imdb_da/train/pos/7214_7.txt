Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of the mysterious films in Sleuth's tradition that would be very easy to destroy given any real study of the movie's plot. Therefore, I would be brief to say that this is a game, a man who is a famous mysterious playwright, another man who is a promising author, the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have weather, and a German psychic together for the trip. Director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to film, is pretty good at most for creating the excitement that the movie needs to run on. The dialogue is quick, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. Christopher Reeve is usable and actually grows on you the more you see him acting. Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychic. What about Dyan Cannon? Love how the Lumet wrapped her rear in the right tight pants and might have worn her at the snag stops, but she's terribly disappointed in this role - a role that should have been given to an older actress and a certain less seductive. But why stifle with an obvious attempt to bribe his male viewers when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap is fun, sophisticated, witty and stylish. The mystery has some sharp faults that detract from something, and I wasn't quite happy with the end, but looking at Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's elevated dictionary was enough to prevent my interest and keep it captive throughout the length of the movie.
