Impactful movie of four city slickers in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen faces their darkest fears when tackling a challenging whitewater ride on a river to be replaced by a dam. When locals decide to "walk their way" with interlopers, it leads to more deaths and lots of trauma to the survivors. Each of the travelers is excellent, although Voight gives the lead and the strongest performance. The nature and culture of the landscape is well-developed, including the breathtaking duel of banjo. I saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). I kind of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already established. Not the kind of movie you could see every week, but it has a strong punch and is beautifully recorded.
