Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dope from San Dimas, sent on another trip in life, as one from the future feels the opposite as it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> Only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. When they meet Grim Reaper they get the chance to survive playing him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from destroying what future they should have. Besides playing roles, they have ... perfected, they also play (and revive a few extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of the battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with "what it can be" instead of "what was." Without destroying the movie, I can't give you more information about this (I think you just have to see them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
