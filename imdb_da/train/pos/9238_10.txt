Although others have commented that this video is only an edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend". If you see the original, you will find that the dialog from this video edition was edited. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I want to say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the tab than the original episodes offered on DVD now. Another good video is the Conquest for Earth, which had several scenes from the Galactica 1980 than the actual broadcasts themselves. All in all, I consider this a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the network wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.
