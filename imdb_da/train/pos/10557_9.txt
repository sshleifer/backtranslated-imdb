Just saw this at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was fun as hell and a little surreal. Find a place in Toronto where these two losers live in this run-down house in the middle of a motorway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are as good as the two losers who want the world to just go away. The action, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole film looks good for such a low budget. Director / Writer Vincenzo Natali participated in this screening and he seemed so intelligent and down to earth. This guy is so inventive with these amazing stories that work so well in small budgets, it puts big budget Hollywood crap to shame!
