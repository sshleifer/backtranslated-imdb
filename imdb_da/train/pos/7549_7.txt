A young cat tries to steal his brother's soul from death, but gets only half of it, and then you have to go on an adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. Frankly, I'm not sure what happens in this movie, which is full of very strange, very surrealistic images, some of which parents may find disturbing (ie the cats slice off a portion of a pig traveling with them and roasting it like bacon, as all three eat). This is a very strange movie that some have looked like Hello Kitty on acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty made by Dali. (This is definitely more alive than Destino, who was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If your up for a very off beat movie that will challenge your perceptions of things then watch this movie. Just be ready for some very strange pictures that will be burned in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
