I originally saw 8 simple rules on the Disney Channel UK for the first series and was completely hooked. Since they did not show it any more, it got annoyed, but then there was 1 satred who showed the 2nd series. I didn't think another series would start after I read John Ritter's death, but the second series wasn't great. The latest series is back to the old excellent standard. I hope they continue to produce more shows soon, although I could see every show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character as the airhead Bridget and also performs wonderfully in Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and Grampa. I continue to see it until it ends until then, I hope it happens as much as ever
