When I heard about this movie, it should be the funniest thing I have ever seen, yes it was fun. I mean, I liked it all till the end, when ........... Oh no I can't tell you, it should be for yourself. It's fun except. The vulgar language. That's why I say if you like movies that are fun in sexual ways, see it, but if not, don't make money on renting or buying it.
