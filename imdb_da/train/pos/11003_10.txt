Listen, I don't care what anyone says, as Cypher is nothing short of a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I do not repeat, a B movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say, I am a known to the world's finest spy movie, and this movie is nothing short of top flight. I can't overemphase how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy films ever seen and ever made. The technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. In fact, I must admit that Cypher totally surprised hell out of me. In fact, I have recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics, some of whom played the movie, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Don't listen to the hates. And in fact, mostly, reviews of Cypher have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but it is also a great movie. Cypher is the kind of movie that is so advanced and so beautifully crafted that it is the head of most critics and all the cynics. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher at all. Again, film, background, technology, storyline and acting are all 100% top class in world class. Of course, I will not give anything away. This is not a spoiler. And although it's the critics' claim that Cypher should have been in cinemas, I believe the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to be just right for DVD publishing only and not in a bad way. Cypher has to be the largest underground spy girl ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... look! Cypher also makes the distinction between being in AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is the counter-espionage at the absolute best. Hands and hats away. Nothing is what it seems, and the truth is alien to fiction. The future is now.
