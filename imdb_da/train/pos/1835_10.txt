What an excellent movie is this, I have no words to describe. I do not know how the rating of the movie is 7.3 it must be 9.3 yet no one else can make this movie and the actor of Akshay is just excellent in the second half of the movie makes you cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending, making the movie perfect. You have to watch this movie once, I think twice well, it's up to you. Anyways I love this movie and it's not just sad and fun, but it also gives you a really good opinion and what to do, I think it's one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but I know the people have deferent, choose it. The only thing I don't like about this movie is the music and the background music is good, but the songs are not good enough. I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be a music director, but still we can't do anything about it so ya.
