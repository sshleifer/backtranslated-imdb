One of the ten best comedies ever <br /> <br /> This seems a comedy so joyful and light that sings. Keaton's comedies are entertaining, harmonious, intelligently ordered, thought. Entirely entertaining, deliberately lovely and inventive, TREE AGES should belong to a draft comedy top ten if I were to sketch one. A triple love story will enchant the viewers; I want to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy is like Along the DESTINY upside ?? down ?? or B REBOURS. Again crossing a couple of times ?? and eras ?? in the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton times? In a Muslim country, in the Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in both films, one, one grim, spooky melodrama; - The other, a bright, virtuous filled comedy. At Keaton, it is basically the same pair; and maybe the same with Lang. The child wanted by both Buster and Beery is lovely. I have found three good days well-written and clever, without being incredibly sophisticated; Basically, the reason is very POPEYE? as ?? the child is a piece of furniture, the only main characters are the two male rivals ?? Keaton and Beery. Keaton's movies are simply hugely sympathetic and perhaps one would be tempted to claim that this is like ambitious fun, but it's not, but it's fun, great fun, plenty of fun. And Wallace Beery makes a nice nemese.
