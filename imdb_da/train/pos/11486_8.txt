Saw this movie at Rotterdam IFF. You can ask questions about some decisions made by the spouse - such as choosing a mocumentary form for such a sensitive and terrible subject - but this movie certainly hits you in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. Hope it gets the distribution it deserves.
