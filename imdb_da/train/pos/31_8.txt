Once in a castle ...... Two little girls play in the castle of the sea. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Runs through long corridors when they read the newspaper at the living room where their grandfather sits on an armchair. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn looks interested in a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: "I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady". Suddenly Evelyn takes a dagger nearby and sticks Kitty's doll and cuts her (doll). A fight follows. And Evelyn almost uses the tablecloth against Kitty. Grandpa intervenes and the worst is avoided. <br /> <br /> Later, their grandfather tells them playfully related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, where a lady dressed in black sticks a lady dressed in red: <br /> <br /> "For a long time Some time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle, sisters and hated each other, the room of the red lady and piled her seven times, one year later the red lady left her grave, she killed six innocent people, and her seventh Victims were the black lady. Every single hundred years repeats events in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. "Grandfather ends her story by saying that, according to legend, sixteen years from now , the red queen must come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. Sixteen years pass ..... <br /> <br /> This is the start of the movie. There are many twists and turns in the movie. It's better for you to forget the logic (if you really analyze it, the story isn't sensible) and just follow the movie with its wonderful colors, the beautiful women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack. Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. There is a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a couch, there is something to dream about. And don't forget: The lady in red kills seven times! <br /> <br /> If you fancy "La Dama Rossa ...", see also "La Notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla Tomba".
