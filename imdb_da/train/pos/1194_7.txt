The film largely focuses on bullying Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him. Set amidst a hunt for dwindling buffalo buffalo, it depicts the end of a tragic era of pointless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both buffalo and Indians. Taylor is dazzled by his hatred of Indians and his naive, that buffalo crews will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animals for animals, while in another murder, Indians then eat the food they had cooking on their fire. Under this ruthless exterior is an insecure person set up to beg his peers (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It is not the most comfortable movie and weighed down by the drama it creates, leading to a gloomy and very appropriate conclusion in a blizzard.
