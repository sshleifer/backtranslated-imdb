This is one of a few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a space dog called K-9 is also included. This Looney Tunes episode is very fun, has a pretty good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is quite strange, so be prepared for it, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian has been sent to earth to capture a land animal and bring it back to Mars. With her faithful dog K-9 Marvin puts out and soon finds traces of no other rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He greets them with treats and thinks they are trick or treat in their costumes. Little does he realize they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you will probably like this. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
