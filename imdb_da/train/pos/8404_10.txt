Single-tuned but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings on acquiring the car in his dreams. Shared sharing and love makes it quick to start with girls Bobby has picked up at the local pizzeria, but he finds much responsibility, danger and heartache come to be the owner of such a mechanical marvel. <br /> <br /> The Van is a guilty pleasure for me. It captures the mood of the mid-70's and has enough unintentional humor to put it in the "so bad, good" category.
