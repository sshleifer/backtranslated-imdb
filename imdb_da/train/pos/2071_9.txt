For those of us Baby Boomers who came late on stage to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us the way in this amazing feature. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is easy: Cool hood meets small town Sheriff and All-Hell ensues, but nuts and bolts in this movie enchant car nuts in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, it's not a great literature either, but it's a serious movie about cars, rebellions, and the genius that is Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and for what Martin will be. I loved this movie growing up as a teenager in the 70's and so will you.
