While Carmen-Bizet rehearing, middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman who is unable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his envy as D. José in the original opera, captivating fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great movie by Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the artist's life in connection with the characters they are repeating, and many times it is not entirely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction in this original version of the famous Bizette's opera, based on the novel Prosper Mérimée. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
