One of the unprecedented gems of the 1980s has Scenes ... sharp sharp satire and excellent performances by Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a lot of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delicious send-up of class war and the people of these classes. The script is hilarious and the characters, while not subtle, are nuanced. And sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese guy who squeezes one of the other characters, is a "gang") not put in for "sociological value" as another review implies that they should be. The value here lies in what the movie makes fun of and in the sparkling evil way it does. I found it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
