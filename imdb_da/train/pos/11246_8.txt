Breaking Glass is a movie that anyone who wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. It's a very dark story of how a record label manipulates a singer to make things their way and make as much money out of her as possible. Looking at some of today's TV shows at "Search for a star", both in the UK and abroad, I am always reminded of this movie. Although there is no expert on the subject, the winners of these shows tend to have a very big first hit and then its downhill from there. This movie is going on these shows, although the effect seems to be the same. After deleting from his manager, he played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels, slowly but surely the company changes its lyrics putting her on stimulants and she eventually gets completely burned out. You potential stars tomorrow .... SEE THIS AND KEEP !!!
