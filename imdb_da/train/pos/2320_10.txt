Not only is this movie a good movie for basic filmography (manuscript, acting, attitude, etc.), but also for realism. This movie can take place in any farm or rural setting. It makes no difference if the movie takes place in Louisiana or if it should take place in Kansas. The story and the messages it contains will remain the same. This film shows family values ​​and relationships with an older audience while showing youthful behavior to younger viewers. Anyone who sees this will go away with something that has touched them personally, I know I did. The end is too close to home for me, so as not to break into tears every time I see it. The end emphasizes the importance of agricultural safety, and anyone who has ever worked on a farm must see this film. Don't pay attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
