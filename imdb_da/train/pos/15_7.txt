I guess if a movie has magic, I don't have to be fluent or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not detract from the overall positive effect of seeing people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are clever. But Stanley can't understand enough to work because he can't read; He cannot read because he has had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, has not had enough adventure and cannot understand how to move past the U-turn, as her life took. In both their mistakes and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an irris would shut down year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never saved his illiteracy enough to work in construction or any other better paying job. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of history, their unfolding seems somewhat distinct. I suppose nobody took the time to rethink the script. Still, it's a good movie. Just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on the screen if anyone had it!
