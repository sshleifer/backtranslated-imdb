If you like mech war games, it's pretty good. Some of it is cheap, but the robot games are worth seeing. I have enjoyed the mech war for some time and it is basically the only movie I've ever seen that comes close to the sense of how it would be to pilot one of the great mechs. If you like the genus, the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 extra Steel Battalion. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There really should be some more movies on the same theme out there. Less remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
