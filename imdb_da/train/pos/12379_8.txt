I was an unhurt in an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it is even more eerie and scary on the big screen. Although it's been about 9 years since I've seen it, it's still one of my all-time favorites. With the risk of sounding trite, "They just don't make them like this anymore!" If Sixth Sense freaked you out at all, this movie is for you! Great history, incredibly cast of characters, vicious attitude; Even the soundtrack has a scary quality for it. I highly recommend you not see it alone. What a brownstone apartment rented in 1977 alone will make you grab (it would be at least 10 times the price today).
