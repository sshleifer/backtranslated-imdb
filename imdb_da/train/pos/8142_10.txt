Chances are, you think this movie is incredibly stupid, the first time you see it. But if you by chance see it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I am well in the hundreds now), you will find yourself spitting a line from here and there and blowing yourself up! My friends and I have actually cast fear of a black hat party to get more of our friends, "as they say, down the riots".
