Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one was under my skin (excuse the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in the form of revenge film. Not only did I think I felt a lot of hate for the screener and lots of sympathy for "screwee". I felt myself pampered and disgusted at some times that are truly a rare and wonderful thing for a somewhat horrified horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscant of "Hellraiser", but come out as a tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy-handed piece that doesn't give the viewer much to think about, but I enjoy being attacked by a movie once in a while. This piece brings it and doesn't appeal. I liked this one very much. DO NOT see while eating pudding.
