Mesmerizing, breathtaking and horrifying, this hauntingly beautiful movie is "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slowly in pace, quiet in the mood, it gives a good glimpse of the Earth's poisoned patches, which may well indicate an inevitable punishment. There is no doubt in my heart - nature is plagued and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of mankind that governs evolution and progress, has transformed us into something like cancer, on the way to consuming the host and dying with it ... Produced landscapes are an unforgettable viewing experience - at least I will never see my toaster and stroking the same way again.
