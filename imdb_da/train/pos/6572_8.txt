One of my favorite films for a number of years was "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to pamper my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can't carry any movies he might have had a hand in. Jakes Speed ​​Adventures is actually playing with some themes that resemble those in the last ... Hero; so i was happy to find it on dvd so i could see these themes being played as well. <br /> <br /> Despite "plot-within-the-plot" involving white slavery during an African nation's civil war, this is not an action movie. The plot that "plot-within-a-plot" is within is actually a question that the film does not intend to solve: Is Jake Speed ​​a real person who helps the heroine save his sister from the white slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine somehow has entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest this is not all that is clearly defined in the movie and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are fully aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the audience may desire from such a fictitious "fairy-tale" universe. It is indeed a rich theme whose potential is the light of the film's gracious and campy sense of humor. There are weaknesses in the movie - first and foremost, it is filmography, which makes the movie look like a TV to show. And pacing does matter at times. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I enjoy the adventure they live but stupid. And I just find fascinating the idea that this adventure actually takes place in a novel. <br /> <br /> Keeping up with multiple views -m good show!
