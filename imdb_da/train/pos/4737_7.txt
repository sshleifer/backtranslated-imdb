Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (A biologically engineered soldier who is part of a superfighter's elite fighting force who decides that he feels that killing and brutal force are not the ways to settle everything and become a pacifist and a librarian.However, when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by raising the police - his best friend is a policeman, the black mask becomes. the film goes on, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining. I love martial arts movies that are spectacular. People flying around lighter than air and restoring a split second after stroke, keep pace and action not stop. But that's what this movie is all about right now, a showcase by Jet Li does what he does best, and it's spectacular showmanship of his skills, which at least is top notch. As with most fast action martial arts films ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are currently appearing here in the US for the first time, are making these movies on the plot and high on amazing physical performance. But I have to say, even with the big gaps left in the plot (like how we probably see him in his apartment when he only had a scene before he had 20 men who are no more than 15 meters from him with characters on the run - the scene just cuts to him in the apartment ....... ohh well suspending faith I think), the movie to me remains interesting. It is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel that it could have been a little shorter. But still around a great high-action movie.
