I have never bothered to watch this movie in theaters, though I remember hearing the name over and over again. I've finally seen it this week and what a joy. For some reason I was expecting it was not very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in. I read many of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her battle in the ring, but it was wonderful with Diana that she is a true struggle in life. All she has to do is find her place where she is, who she is, and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story, and I'm surprised this is Michelle Rodriguez's first time - what a great job she did. Adrian and her coach were also quite good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it doesn't matter at least. The story, the will and the performances completely outweigh any mistakes (which usually comes with indie filmmaking anyway). A compelling depiction of a girl who finds herself and triumphs over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
