This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl alone. Realism and subtle nuances offered to Ashley Judd's character, Ruby, by the story, capture what can only be described as a true life-setting in the panhandle of Florida. From the screen door's sludge, to the lack of work, the echo of what life really is on the "Red-neck Riviera" gives rough choices for the young girl. Paradise didn't come easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and fraud, and learns to be her own woman with a force flowing from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and contagious time exudes warmth and governs respect and admiration. The careful pace of character development resembles that of "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda, and also directed by Victor Nunez.
