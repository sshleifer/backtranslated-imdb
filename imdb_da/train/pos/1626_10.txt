This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour then go see it. It's called blonde and lace, so don't expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a fun movie to watch a date or a friendship (especially if you're not too curious. Lol) Pamela and Denise are still beautiful chickens. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It should be light, fun and superficial. One more thing, I don't think girls will appreciate and like this movie, but guy will certainly.
