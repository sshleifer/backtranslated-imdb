I was a fan of the book ever since the third class, so of course I had watched the movie, read the sequel and looked at the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem with that was that it didn't follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl who owns a first addition to the book. But gradually I decided to try again and ignored the book (kind of like what you have to do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the series wonderful! It was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy to keep everyone together. It is really fun! Clean and wonderful!
