It is very rare that a movie appeals to viewers of all ages - to children for a fine story and a wonderful colorful production, and to adults for a literature script, fine production values, good casting / action, all tied together with a fine Rozsa score . Two almost simultaneous films perform this - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "Robin Hood's Adventure" (1938). Some of the history of this production is fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and proved to be a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer Alexander Korda was later knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, trade and politics! You must at least secure a good CD of this movie for your library!
