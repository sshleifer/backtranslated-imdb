I don't know why critics ruined this movie. I almost never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a bit scary - I don't normally go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself to see it during the day. I don't have to bother! ;) (Cinema was full of kids too heh !;) Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a scary way. The special and sound effects were awesome. I also loved the music track, especially the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the kids how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally got her power, peace and freedom.
