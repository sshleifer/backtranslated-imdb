I rented this movie and saw it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting phrases. The story is original and well written. Power Booth and Paxton both deliver good performances. The story is told in an interesting way with both flashbacks 20 years back, so spots in the present, alternately back and forth. This style of narrative provides a good thriller that cannot become boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
