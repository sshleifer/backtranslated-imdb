Fantastic documentary. Saw it on original airdate and on DVD a couple of times in the last couple of years. I was shocked that it was not even nominated for a best documentary Oscar for 2002, the year it was released. No other documentary even comes close. <br /> <br /> It was on TV recently for the 5 year anniversary, but I missed the added "where are the now" segment at the end, unless I got hold of Tony now working for the Hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism on documentaries from a few on this list. I can't see how this could have been done any differently. They had less than 6 months to collect this and get it in the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother hasn't had any projects in the four years since. What have they done?
