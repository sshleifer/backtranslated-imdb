For me, it was more of a wake-up call, and realizing that most of what we see, hear, read, and think about most depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution that they freely purchased will not be weakened by this media control or any attempt at misinformation. Once again, it turns out that the many needs today outweigh the needs of the few. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not a really difficult thing to do.
