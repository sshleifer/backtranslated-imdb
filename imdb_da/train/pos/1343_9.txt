Thre is not a single scorsese movie I would put on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best I have run through my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese is patient reading of favorite movies, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 DVD pages worth of material. It was supposed to be a British production as everything about American corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, focused-on-content approach taken here. And an American production would have required him to say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. I want everyone to take a side from his love of film. You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more "Me-too" votes for The Godfather etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movie. If they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored and that makes him a convincing, involved speaker on the subject. I greatly appreciate his articulated, generous interviews over the last decade. <br /> <br /> On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he is excited to show you some fuzzy film, rather than when he teaches you didactically something well-established about film history. And I want him to pick the three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. It is very distracting.
