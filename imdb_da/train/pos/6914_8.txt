This movie features one of Richard Dreyfus's greatest performances, as an actor who plays a dictator and makes it so convincing that his own mother does not discover the impostor. Also this movie is fun, but also has a serious side. What is especially interesting about this film is the character Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the country's leader. Madonna's evolution from lover to political leader attaches great importance to the quality of history and the film's entertainment value. And the protagonist, who at the beginning of the film is a giant actor and something of a buffoon, also develops and at the end of the film commands respect. I liked this movie.
