Love the lyrics and the story. Very fun with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer provide great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction between Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very sympathetic, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt hit man. All three players are among my favorites and have made them into a special treat in this movie. A good addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
