George Cukor dishes a brooding and cynical classic. The characteristic Ronald Coleman is best in this piece of Noir about an actor losing in his roles. The acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) has driven his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) away with his fiery temperament and irregular behavior. But the two continue to work together to satisfy their audience. Things begin to change as John gets upset with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He becomes deep in character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to go a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress (Shelley Winters) but has no memory of the terrible act. <br /> <br /> Colman seems flawless in this role. The winter is very impressive as the young woman is determined to get away from her crooked life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
