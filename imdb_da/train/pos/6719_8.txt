I like this movie because it is a fine work with cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It's filled with Super Surfer Greg Noll's home videos and a boat reading of amateur video from others that adapts to his 50 years of passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the extent that it is approaching aesthetic honor. It is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, but trivial you can think of surfing being athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.ds (again maybe). It believes in surfers' quest. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace that comes from war cessation. Surfers celebrate the end of war on the northern shore of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years earlier. It celebrates the downturn of a country that fought for a cold war - instead of a hot war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but just a little bit historic. I suppose Alexander The Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no weapons. The only beach-head surfers conquer have a beer stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhaling.
