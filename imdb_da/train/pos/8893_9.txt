The 60s is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries we follow a North American family with 3 members. But we do not see them only. We also follow the story of several characters as a black preacher, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters we see some shots from the Vietnam War, between the scenes. The next chapter does not start, where the last one is finished, it begins a little while, and gives us a little mystery about what happened. Generally, The 60's mini-series is a must, not only for hippies fanatics, but for everyone with a little curiosity on the subject.
