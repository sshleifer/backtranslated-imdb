Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann made together to make some of the best westerns ever made, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the movie, however, is the spectacular Canadian rockies that serve as the backdrop for history. Some of the best screenings ever made in the film's history. <br /> <br /> In all five of the Westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly cast. No exception here right down to parts that can only get a few lines, the signs are strongly etched with these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical hardcore lonely in this movie whose only real friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It is Brannan's death in the hands of the bad guys, which finally makes him unleash the gold settlement from the evil ones and redeems himself in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the crook of the head and he was an understated actor with a great selection. He could play lovely old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly unpleasant and crooked villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
