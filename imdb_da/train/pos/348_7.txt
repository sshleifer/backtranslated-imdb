These slasher pictures are past their seller by date, but this one is fun. <br /> <br /> The Valentine cards are themselves quick and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> The movie has a peach of a line ... "He's no angel ..." when he's actually an angel !!! Looking at Buffy Reruns will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The support is an exciting display of young talent, but the story doesn't give them enough depth. Denise Richards on DVD extras seemed to think girls on the band tied well together and that would give you the feeling that you felt with their characters. Sorry, but NO! The direction is very good and one manages to show very little really do and rely on your fantasies implicit threat. Much can also be said for the same way that Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> In essence, the main directorate is in the "borrowing" of various other ideas from former slasher Psychos shower scene is tributed together with Halloween's "masking". <br /> <br /> Murdering someone hiding in a body bag is a beautiful original as far as I know !!! <br /> <br / > Easy viewing, not very scary, but a few good jumps. If it was a choice between The Hole and this, choose The Hole Slasher movie has had their day and it's just another slasher good slasher but nothing groundbreaking !!!
