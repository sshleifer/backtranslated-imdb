"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. But it is not good for everyone because of the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence in some situations. The film manages to represent in an anecdotal, credible way, "life" in NYC neighborhoods where drug issues are important. This depiction is again used as a decoration for a most thoughtful and exciting drama supported by powerful dialogues (but I had difficulty understanding some of them because English is not my native language. On video it is OK). There is a slight overlapping in some cases, but I think it fits in well with the general orientation Fishburne gave to the movie, which gives more reflection than just a good style exercise, especially in time / action management. The characters, though not simple, are easy to relate to, and the actors do a good job of publishing them. Besides, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not for bragging, you should enjoy watching the movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie 9/10.
