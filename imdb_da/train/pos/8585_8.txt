Engaging, narrative narrative about the captured American army horror that must prove its innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in an apparently condemned attempt to convince a military domination that he was actually an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the vein of the classical courtroom, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-crafted mystery governed by an excellent cast, Director Kulik's constant momentum, and effective plot twists. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 and subsequently stunned for this review with the presence of many "name" actors and some action sequences. Dillman, who replays his role, is spot-on as the dubious defense lawyer whose attention sometimes falls to the personal situation of Ryker's supportive, yet distant wife, played with Aplomb by Vera Miles. Rounding off the front line is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man who usually puts restraint challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is located. Marvin shifts perfectly from dismissed indifference to passionate determination, providing a compelling, often intense performance, the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this performance that will raise the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best lists of courtroom dramas. But despite its apparent turmoil, "Sergeant Ryker" is still a tight and convincing study, like a book you just can't put down. Highly recommended.
