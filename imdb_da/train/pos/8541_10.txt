I don't know, it's not what you expect from a movie of this kind <br /> <br /> kinship - it's a direct descendant of the best years in our lives <br /> <br /> and the men. .. movies dealing with men in the hospital <br /> <br /> dealing with tragic circumstances. But this movie is full of wonderful <br /> <br /> surprises and performances. It features starring from Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a fairly risque nude scene) and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote <br /> <br /> in his book Cinema of Outsiders (about the independent film <br /> <br /> movement) "The Waterdance is coherent, attention to detail and <br /> <br / > Unentimental with a vicious down-to-earth humor - it is immediately <br /> <br /> fun and boring, and the whole cast is impressive. "I was <br /> <br /> extraordinarily moved by this movie, it's hard to frame yes, but also have very nice moments and laughs loudly. A rare gem.
