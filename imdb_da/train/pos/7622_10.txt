I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so poignant and scary ... so was the pilot's part 2 ... I will definitely keep tuning this show! This is the real survivor! I've looked at a few of the other comments and I can see it already after just one or two episodes of morons laughing already wolf ... Sorry if it's not another reality show, kiddies! Once upon a time there was ... now brace yourself! Actual TV shows! And this is actually good as opposed to most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-tenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series, they are dishing out ... See this yourself to form your own meaning, don't take one from the head here!
