An exceptionally straight-faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Incomplete, as can be expected from a movie clearly shot on a tight budget, but drama is involved - it is one of those films that when repeated at nauseum on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call That, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you need to work. Along W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget fellows who have a real ability to pace in a genre movie when he is actually interested in the material (ie don't see any of his Shannon Tweed flicks with a 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who have had too little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford , even Gary Sandy to chrissakes) puts their whole in some of their best roles this year - as for Grieco, he has the right look, although his play is a small note - obviously his character must be self-destructive throughout the movie , but Grieco does not transfer it completely. I controlled IMDB and I see that the author also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" to the director - both smaller classics in their own rights, but of course "stupid" Roger Cormon-like Cinema - this is more like some of the better Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B pictures of the 70s - giving you the exploit but offering simultaneous drama involvement - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane" and the comic last moments are a bit disturbing, but a well-written, character-driven average straight-to-video actioner. Small performances like this should not be overlooked when they come together, which is rare enough (as I was reminded when I tried to sit through an Albert Pyun monstrosity called "Heatseeker" the second night - this low budget thing is not as easy as it looks - but it's another story!)
