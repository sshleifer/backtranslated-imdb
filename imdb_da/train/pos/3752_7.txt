This film is unusual and bizarre, and it is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this card a 7, just because it's so unique and outside the wall, but much of the time it looks like it's bizarre, just to be bizarre. If the movie had been able to integrate its more bizarre moments into a part of a plot, it would have been really amazing. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is that the creators seem to have just gathered a bunch of crap on spatulas, so threw in a whole bunch more crap that sounded like it would be fun that comes from the mouth of a spatula. This is definitely worth checking out, but it is not the highest rate at any stretch of the creators of wild fantasies.
