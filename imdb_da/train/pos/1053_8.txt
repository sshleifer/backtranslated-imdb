Sisters in law are made by the same directors in the rather curious fascinating 'Divorce, Iranian style', which was as accurate as it was said when we caught a glimpse of the divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. The good thing about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for such a country. Yet they are about lots of men who used to get around the women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women have made great progress in society, as divorce is recognized by legal and women's rights. Then the judges often judge the men to behave in a primitive way during these times. Not to say that the women appearing at court get the softer treatment. One of the primary focuses on the movie is a case of child abuse by an aunt. The judges do not waste time throwing on the woman with rage. And who said that justice is not being earned any more? With these 2 behind the bench. They often execute maximum penalties! Ya! Well done!
