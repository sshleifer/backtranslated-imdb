I love this movie because it showed they didn't kill for fun, but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job depicting Ned and Joe. It has a couple of quick inappropriate scenes, but it's just that. The language is very mild and does not even know it is there. This movie shows that just because they are banned does not mean they are evil killers! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book Ned watched! This is also how people remember them from their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and become interested as I have.
