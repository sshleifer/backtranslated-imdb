Oh dear, we do not like it when our superhero loves interest developing a brain, do we? <br /> <br /> Something has happened to people, they have lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feeling-good, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - fun, sexy and genuine. I laughed aloud at least five times, and I am not ashamed to say that I also had a tear in my eye a few times. The game, acting and script are great, I see many movies across the board, and I have not seen one in this genre that has been so successful. Those who disagree tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you should judge it on its own merits.
