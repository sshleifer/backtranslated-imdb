I watched this movie when the Mystery Science Theater ran it in 1993. It's the worst I've ever seen. So bad indeed, that with pure freakiness, this movie must get a ten rating because it must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> The one who wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten. I really mean the devil vs santa? Hell Visions? Scary laughing reindeer? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crow breaks out during MST3K shows, "This is good ol 'fashioned nightmare fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are lots of weird induendo and screwed up theology. Merlin (presumably Arthurian Merlin) hangs out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie the sky). Santa Claus talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for children asking for siblings. There are symbols around the castle that resemble pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have seen it every year since 1993, and we postpone anyone we can hold for 2 hours to see it with us.
