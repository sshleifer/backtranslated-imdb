<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it okay. The film is about a guy who only steals Porsches. Gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years later and adds nothing to it. In fact, it has many scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
