After seeing Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction don't look so extreme. Perhaps by today's blood and ball standards, it doesn't seem to be so edgy, but if you think this was 1972 and that the movie has a really creepy core, then it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie nothing seemed really unusual until I got to the scene "Dueling Banjos". In that scene, the brutality and edge of this movie is truly visible. When I saw Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) head to head with an apparently resumed young boy, it really shows how edgy these movies can get. When you think the baby has a small banjo, which he probably could do by hand over Drew's lovely expensive guitar, you can really figure out how the four men are out of their territory. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes it is very credible and never stretches past its borders. But what really distinguishes this movie from four businessmen who get more than they negotiated on a canoe trip is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all characters away from ordinary caricatures or stereotypes. So when the movie goes into full horror and excitement, I have really looked after all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The action is universally outstanding. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease), the great cast leads. Jon Voight is probably the hardest of all in this movie, making his conversion from family to warrior very credible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character transforms throughout the film. Down Beatty (Life) is also good at an extremely difficult role and is being raped by a hillbilly while Ronny Cox turns in a credible performance. One thing that really made these movies powerful for me is that the bad guys were as scary as anyone I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely scary as Hillbilly's. <br /> <br /> Overall release was excellent and I suggest it to anyone except for those with weak stomachs and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
