An entertaining Kung Fu movie, with plays, plot and battle scenes a cut above average chop socky. All casts are sympathetic characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics are fun to watch and his strict companion shows extremely impressive abilities. For me, the film's only sharp mistake is the size of the casting - sometimes things get a little confused as the film chops and change between different sub-plates, and some of the characters are not as fully stretched as you wish. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie should first and foremost be judged on the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple surely delivers that count. The movie climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show his abilities against a worthy opponent. Overall, the Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but definitely worth looking for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. Misc Notes: 1987 Warner Home Video release, I saw, was (predictably) badly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.
