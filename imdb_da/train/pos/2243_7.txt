I thought the whole movie played beautifully with new pictures and interesting filmography throughout. The actors were on top of their character back in almost perfect timing and looked good. The music was lush and well thought out. It even had a decent twist of an end. So what is it all about with them? The story was not quite fresh (felt like a remnant of "Running Man" with the whole TV show idea), but the attitude of Christianity and Judaism on how the public chooses their Messiah certainly sounded true enough. It was sensible to follow this one man who was set for a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his ability. It is possible that Christians or other religious people choose this because the film has the word "god" in it, but it shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is teach an opportunity for people who might never have seen the world that way, especially in the modern world, where Christianity has become increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most part. Check it out if you are not too offended to see an entertaining movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the upcoming modern Messiah for a TV near you.
