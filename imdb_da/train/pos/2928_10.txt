EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest stand-up concert movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up actions have usually lulled at some point, but not this one people. For 90 minutes, there is not a moment that does not have splitting fun. From the moment Eddie makes a hilarious bad impression of Mr.T, the laughter is uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was done in 1983, and Eddie hasn't done anything just as much fun. It's amazing that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not fun at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're out there, go back and make a concert movie in the vein of DELIRIOUS. Trust me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know it.
