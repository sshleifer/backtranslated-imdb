I saw this on television so long ago that I can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scary and most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. There is a simultaneous subtle but intense fear induced by the woman in black lurks at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so you feel (as a lawyer), unsure whether it is just imagination or not. It is also one of the few movies that really made me afraid to watch. "Production values" are hung, good movies are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using films, actors, places / sets, music, details of details and ... imagination. A real gem.
