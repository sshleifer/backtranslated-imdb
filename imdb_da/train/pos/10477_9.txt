Walking close to comedy and drama is one of the hardest acts in the cinema. How do you laugh at the misery of others and not start to feel bad when it goes too long? <br /> <br /> Now, this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs, beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well. I especially like the concept that a trick of history lawfully made alcohol when white Europeans liked it and marijuana illegally, because "the other races" used it ... undoubtedly true and expose a racist side to the marijuana laws, who were so openly flaunted by peoples all over the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary "DVD Extra" comment ... two of them actually ... run through the whole movie with both the actors and again with the authors. I continued to see things I was sure were not in the first movie, but then realized how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first time. What a hoot! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
