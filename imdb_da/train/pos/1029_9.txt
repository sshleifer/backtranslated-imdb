I would have rated the series a perfect 10 for excellent and consistently high quality history and character development had it not been for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season "Infinite", where (it would surely seem) Asgard has been killed in a very hurried, unconvincing and very uncertain way, left me in disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the extremely hasty end of the series, it is obvious that many of the history's arches were originally planned to occur for at least one season. My guess would be that they quickly accelerated these stories to place the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-DVD moves! Unless Asgard returns in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think the fans have been cheated with a bad clean-up of loose ends! Bad end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
