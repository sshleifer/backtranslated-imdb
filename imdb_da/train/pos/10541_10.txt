I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is cute! :) Still, the only thing that slightly disturbed me was at the beginning where everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the film was very creative. I think that all the play was well done, the actors performed the personality of their people perfectly. Everything fits well together. It's really a shame that their is not a soundtrack. It would have been great! Because this is a Canadian movie and because it is one of my favorites, I give this movie a 10 out of 10!
