I'm amazed that movies like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends, and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Never thought that a movie of 146 minutes could make me think about it again and again. Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a washed-out terrorist agent taken to the bottle. Once awarded to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive bow has begun in the way that only a cute little girl can offer. Pita is inevitably kidnapped by bullies, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City will have to pay the price to venture its character's teddy bear catalyst. Yes, he's been ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie.
