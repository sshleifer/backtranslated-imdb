I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectations because of all the negative reviews I read before I went. I went because I was curious about what all this sad was because some of the records were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea that has put some of my favorite movies. I liked hosting but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies so you can get a feel for my taste: Mirror mask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It wasn't confusing as everyone said, and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some gaps in history, but it wasn't really anything. I look like such things and stopped asking why long ago when I see the summer fans. The Korean legend was interesting, reincarnation stuff was different, and I thought the protagonists suspiciously dressed as Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's (Behr) hair looked so Asian. Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual ornate sense of life, intense feelings and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
