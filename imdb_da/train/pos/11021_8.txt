After the success of Die Hard and it's successors, it is no surprise that in the 1990s a glut of 'Die Hard on a .....' movie hit the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to save Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career. Cliffhanger is a great nit-picker dream, especially to those who are expert on mountaineering, base jumping, aviation, facial expressions, action skills. All in all, it's full of excuses to dismiss the movie as an overloaded pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out of a horse! But if you forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and unthinkable entertaining body that delivers so much excitement and unintentional lots of laughs. You must love John Lithow's snowy evil, his cross in all the boxes of the boxes and the spiteful, the permanently harassed and rude 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers. He may be Henry in the 'Portrait of a serial killer' but Michael Rooker is remarkable for a cringe-worthy performance like Hal, he insists on constant shrieking in painful disbelief at his prisoners "that man has never hurt anyone. may be, it really looks like Ralph Waite's Frank character grinning as the girl plummets for her death. Also mention should go to the former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the British bad guy who comes a cropper while using Hal as a human football, yes, you can't help it, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> Forget the better judgment, who cares that "it could never happen," lower your expectations Expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy it! And if you are looking for the Qaulen, he is the one carrying the helicopter.
