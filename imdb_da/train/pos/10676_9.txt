This film was shot in place at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was Britain's response to films like the "Blackboard Jungle". The film stands the time test quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film has some fine performances from some notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool police officer assigned to youth relations, provided that if you catch the children at an early age, they will end up being responsible adults. Notable cameos in the movie include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are brother and sister) trapped in an arsonist web. Tsai Chin still works and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman movie 'The Interpretor'. <br /> <br /> Violent Playground has a gun siege in a school, so it is unlikely that it will be shown on television after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the movie was shot (although it was not born at that time) and has good memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens, featuring excerpts from 'Violent Playground' and a small British movie 'Coast to Coast', which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The homes were demolished in 1987, and the films sometimes went to keep the memory alive. <br /> <br /> There were some complaints from the residents when the movie was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light. Time has helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie I would recommend to you to search this out
