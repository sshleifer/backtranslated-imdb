The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", located in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and feelings of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed with two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress trying to create a romance for her colleagues: she exudes an overwhelming joy of love and life. The second episode presents and the old man dies in a hospital and his wife tries to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way in which the old couple must fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness as opposed to the "hospital crew" (despite evidence of occasional empathy). Compared to Altman's classic, this movie may be less professional, but it is certainly a great piece of art.
