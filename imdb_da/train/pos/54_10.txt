The Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high school shooter, but rather than hashing over the actual appearance, the film depicts the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as a previous conclusion, without any action other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT command after admitting high school killer. The film has three main characters; the detective examining the crime that no guilty parties are left to judge and two teenage girls survive the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing in common except shooting is put together because of it and the drama follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been around the block so much that movie viewers are pretty much familiar with her solid and reliable performance. Occupied Philipps, three years older than Christensen and completely unknown to me, blew me away with his overwhelmingly dramatic strength and the presence of the screen. This girl was part. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and it connects you with its intimate focus on the fragile, ever-growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. However, Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) seems good and superficial compared to the Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see this movie received very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
