saw this in preview - fantastic movie - wonderful characterizations - witty and intelligent dialogue actors were amazing - Peter Falk is up for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - photography was fantastic Traveling was at the theater when we watched the movie and he gave a living account of film production - it was a long dream that he wrote a semi-autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers, and more specifically between him and his father - it was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion support cast was well-chosen and gave the film a sense of family - I recommend this movie to anyone who longs to see intelligent drama and amazing performances
