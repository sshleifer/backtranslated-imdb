Fantastic movie with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to cook. History is based on interest and complexity. Signs and history line suppressed expectations and clich√© at all the right moments. Superb New York City sites - gritty, real - are a great antidote to the commercial requirements of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole movie is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood event in New York City, sex and relationships. It's a rare movie that treats its characters so honestly and sympathetically. LOVED IT! Great cast with remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).
