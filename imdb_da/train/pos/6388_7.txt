Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before I saw it: <br /> <br /> * - It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I like nitpick), but it made me curious the first time I heard it described. <br /> <br /> * - Preview mostly looked cool. Apparently, it was "too cryptic", according to some critics after that fact. <br /> <br /> * - It seemed so bad that Disney said, "Screw it, let's reload" Spy Kids. <br /> <br /> All in all, how's the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for animated fantasy that involves Stirring music and violent special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" goes out completely. For all CGI eye candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that it is almost an effect animator's Best-Of Show, the characters may not be as memorable (except perhaps for the ship's physician) and the plot is a bit boring, but it's not a movie you see on the plot. <br /> <br /> Here's a controversy that plagues me. "The Fall" (as in "the only" took in as five hundred million or something I know animators who would kill to see fifteen bucks of it of this movie compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. Or not, it's true. How about the "South Park" movie? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really, the story and the artwork are all, not the method. I don't know what Disney's comeback movie will be, but I don't think they're out of the picture yet.
