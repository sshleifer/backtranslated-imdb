I found this movie to be very fun, I loved how it made today's modern sports policy. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it is quite fun. And since I'm a sports fan, I loved how they made fun of some of the more ridiculous things in sports. This movie is also ideal for non-sports lovers, probably better for them, as they have to go through life and wonder why people follow sports so close when there are so many crazy rules and complications for sports and the fact That means absolutely nothing. I also found the actual game they came up to be interesting, it's like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting). In general, I highly recommend watching this movie and believing that you end up loving this movie. But if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably won't like it. (but it's with no comedy movie)
