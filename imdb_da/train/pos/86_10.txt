I remember seeing this in a Salem movie theater (where I used to attend "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a young boy and never forgot. It simply amazed me and my friends. I wish there was some way I could see it again! I have tried to find a collection of shorts or something of no use. I recently discovered that it was a Cousteau movie, and it blew my mind even more. How dunk he has achieved this is beyond my understanding. The fish is actually in the cat's mouth at some point if I remember it correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again, I would be very grateful!
