A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers from a heart attack when he finished a concert. Suddenly we see him as he comes in the small town he has left years before. Since leaving so young and having his name changed, it helps to give him a new persona. He bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left to be installed in his new home, but no, Daniel puts up the hard winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local priest, Stig, whose church has a little choir, calls to see if he can interest Daniel to help, but the conductor has no desire to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The city's people leave him alone. He gets an impression on Lena, who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supply. Little by little he comes around and decides to get involved with the choir. Lena will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> Initially, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not what he expected. As they get to know him better, they come around to accept him and make him one of them. His new position does not make him the woman who used to be responsible. The members of the cross are a modley crew member, but they realize the change that Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece of Gabriella, a battered wife, has great influence in her life and her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Denmark's ideas for the repertoire struggle with Stig's own. The priest suddenly begins to see Daniel in a new light; He is a troubled man who likes to read pornographic magazines before he loves his wife, Siv. His ideas collide with the dogma that Siv points to. Stig decides to try to stop what he considers an unhealthy influence on Daniel by shooting him as the leader of the choir. The choir, which has been invited to participate in a competition, travels to Austria. Daniel, now completely fallen for Lena, has a chance for the first time in her life to show her feelings for her when she begins to doubt their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, hears that they make extraordinary music, even though he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, director of this hugely attractive movie, shows that he was the man of direct it. The story involves the viewer from the start. Much of the film's success goes to the ensemblecast that was put together. William Nykvist, who plays the leading role, is the best excuse to watch the movie. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, does excellent work for Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music you hear. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's film film makes the film look better in different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.
