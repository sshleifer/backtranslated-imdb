I was one of about 200 people who were fortunate enough to see an early sneak of this movie. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan a young man with an attempt to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to see, it has something in it For everyone, all action scenes are beautifully played and the comedy is scattered through the movie making it fun without being corny. If I were to compare similar to another movie, it would probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. All the performances are excellent, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine's trusting naive star and under the distinguished Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a star over the best performances like Larnia ... but the notion of talking is Robert The Niro ... In every scene he's in his hand, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a fun fantasy love story, it's the movie. Guys are not off the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout. The kinematics are dead and continue with the feelings of the movies ... nothing about the film seems forced.
