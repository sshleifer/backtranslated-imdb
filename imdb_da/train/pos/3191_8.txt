Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand on visual comedy, successfully leads this Hal Roach road show, featuring a fast and comfortable scenario and excellent casting using a large number of Roach's reliable performers. Although the film was originally designed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley sold stars like Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan selling his car repair business and traveling to Hollywood, trying to change a screen role for the girl he loves, star-truck Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as his set, does this as Cecilia, who is always ready for an audition, is treated by a will parameter, cinema star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), for behind-the-scenes action Naturally a musical comedy with Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy give several cozy interludes, including their famous shit, which involves a little harmony, and we see fine revolutions of eg. Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In balance, deliver the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the image as an emotional movie star, a role he basically creates, and to the director of his clever greeting to Busby Berkeley's cinematic glasses.
