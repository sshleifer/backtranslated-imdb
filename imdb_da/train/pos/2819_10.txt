This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! "The Dragon Lord" (Jacky Chan) and his companion, "Cowboy", made the whole movie fun, meaningful and simply stupid. The movie is a rare mix of a good vs evil battle and (in some way) the wonders and fun that grows up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the young "dragon gentleman" daily activities (so-called because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which includes the implementation of clever, comprehensive methods of escape to study (using the entire household, including the tutor) competing for slightly boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to get love for a local girl competing in "football" (you will see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the midst of a struggle to save a shipment of valuable antiques and more people's lives. <br /> <br /> The movie has its serious moments. But they do not disappear, but inspire. The boy's play is not lost in this exchange, but is actually engaged in evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was amazing), but good you want to see. Let me just say that it really captures the film's spirit. <br /> <br /> Stupid, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great film.
