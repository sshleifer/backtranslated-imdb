All the plays that were made in the first season have been really great. The first look you get from Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or I can call them minis. minis makes the best play I've ever seen the kids do. The main actors and actors, ie. Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, etc., forgets that you see a fictitious tsv. Show they seem to make this show alive. All in all, it's the best show I've ever seen
