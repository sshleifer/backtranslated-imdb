Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. This crosses the border with flying colors. Just a remake, I don't think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie specifically invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The former film is also an enjoyable and entertaining movie, but it has proved to be more like a nature documentary than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. I still thoroughly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must-see for a wildlife. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic, Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young, fun-loving American bulldog, chance. The animals are excellently pronounced by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. There is almost nothing offensive in the movie. There is little scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No fierce violence, save a few tense scenes involving a rolling waterfall, an angry pork and a dark railway shaft. <br /> <br /> Greetings, scary, moving and above all really surprised me to see that this movie won no prizes, not one. Nevertheless, I have to say that this is as good as some of the best images nominated today.
