I was about 7 when I watched this movie first. It wasn't that special then, but a few years later I saw it again and then it made fun, much :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and the "special effects " also. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't wait for a Hollywood-made blockbuster, even this movie was made from approx. $ 1000 :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. Movie and video version too (But I don't think it had ever been shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
