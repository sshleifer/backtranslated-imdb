I don't know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious actions (hajj), but I just felt that the movie is so undervalued. I just can't believe the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far, when the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then. About the movie, one of the well-attended sweet Reda, a French teenager due to sit for the Baccalauréat, is asked by his affectionate elderly father to take him to Mecca. As it may seem (if you don't know much about Islam) your father will have his son drive them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia on a religious pilgrimage once in their lifetime. The generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms ("you know how to read and write, but you know nothing about life," the named father of his son), but a kind of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided. They are loving in their frustrations. The father never speaks in French, although Reda understands Arabic, but can only seem to respond in French. Although they encounter many people on the road: "There is the scary old woman they are gathering in the Bosnian border on their way to Belgrade, and the flashy Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian) who helps them out at the border with Turkey, the reticent and shy women carry burqas on their way to Damascus "focus is always on the mismatched father and son. There is not much of a conversation in the movie that makes it comfortable for your eyes. You see a magnificent view in every city they go. The director shows you the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, even though the film is not relatively long. In general, I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogues and that take their power from the camera's subtlety, but this one was really good. Despite some unanswered details (like Reda's invisible French girlfriend), the film appeals to senses. Great work of art and remember this film is Ismaël Ferroukhi's debut.
