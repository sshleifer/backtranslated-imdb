No, it is not supposed to be a high budget gloss, but it is brilliant in itself. You have to look at it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece with a zombie rapist wearing a 12 inch boyfriend whom he is about to clap. Those who came to give this movie a low review probably searched for the next cult classic or hidden "gem" as they say and just didn't get there completely. I love how everyone points out obvious observations like "5 cent baby attached to a fishing rod" hahaha, yes yes. I don't think a movie with a budget like this could afford "good" actors or effects so they worked with what they had. the intestines and guts were actually very convincing. the movie was a bit choppy, going from sequence to sequence, but overall this is one of the better movies I've seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
