Rohinton Mist's multilayered novel seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting movie is filled with passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a little slow, but there is always something on the screen to catch the audience. The movie perfectly captures a specific time and place with accuracy accuracy. All actors are Indian - few if anyone is known for "Western" audiences - but they are a pleasure to see, especially the little girl who seems very convincing. Don't be discouraged by the title and plot overview - this is a movie seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from it.
