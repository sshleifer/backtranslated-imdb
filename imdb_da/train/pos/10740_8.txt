Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and reported by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon, this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how New York's finest shining on the darkest day. I first saw this when I was a young naive 12 years old, and at that age it still touched me. Knowing how serious 9/11 really was to see this extended the whole effect of 9/11. We found out who the hero was, how everyday life was and how they put their lives in line in a situation where most people would just run and save themselves. These brave men put their lives on the line and see this just increases my admiration for them. See if you can, this is the best documentary I've ever seen.
