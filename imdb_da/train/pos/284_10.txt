The only season has just been sent here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all the stories are so good! And this is a much more realistic view of teenagers and family life today. But it was still strong family values ​​to stick together and be there for each other. their problems were real and it really took you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son) and Nathan Day (boy genius son). every episode a day in their lives, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. I loved Cooper's insight through the exhibition was just amazing. he was by far my favorite character. It ended up with so many things it could have been, I'm really sorry that another season was not made. It was a good show, I will miss it.
