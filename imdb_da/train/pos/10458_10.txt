This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging people today. As someone who has encountered a number of families facing Alzheimer's potential or who is in formative stages, I suggest that any health attorney recommend this movie to any family who is facing the trauma of this disease. The film is primarily designed to talk to the patient's family and enter the very heart of the battle. Casting is excellent and the dramatic depiction is outstanding with a very commanding line.
