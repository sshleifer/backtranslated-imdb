A typical drum through Cheech and Chong's reality, including fabrics, songs, more fabrics, cars and driving, even more fabrics, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It is not as coherent or plausible as it is in smoke, but it is still incredibly fun, without being as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes that include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. Also fun is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's follow-up song. Another remarkable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine), from the Police Academy series and the old laugh. All in all, this is a great follow-up up to smoke and is completely visible when it is sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
