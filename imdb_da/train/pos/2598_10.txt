As if the film was not of value in itself, it is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the movie in NYC; who fall into high school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure of reading the novel was my memory of the carefully detailed film. And for better or worse - and I've read and taught the novel for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
