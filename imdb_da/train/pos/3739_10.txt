I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, not to be frightened soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His persona is similarly to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. However, this film is not set in a war zone, but in a pre-war battle preparation. This wonderful movie is about the malignant realization that the Vietnam War was a mistake and the men bound to be sacrificed for a lost cause. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed as very true love and compassion for his fellow soldier when he despised and irreverence for the company that tried to kill him. Bozz is absolutely cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking his military superior, getting their goat at every opportunity. He is a Jesus Christ figure with a psychology degree, "saving" his with soldiers and showing them in real need, the way out of this man's army. The action and action are sharp and credible and credible As a "Sleeper", Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three best Vietnam movies in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, a top pick.
