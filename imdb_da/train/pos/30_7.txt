An old family story told that two young girls at their grandfather were brought to life 16 years later as he predicted. People are murdered and blood is wasted, and rats scampering over and naked bodies are enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she's not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is amazing in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, which only made another Giallo as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the movie was the appearance that more frames were cut out. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are trying to save Kitty.
