This is a great British movie. A wisely observed script with many quotable lines that perfectly captures what magical mushrooms can do for a man during a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent with the most renowned British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a cast masterpiece and Gary Stretch with his fracture looks brings something strange to the atmosphere. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, I think it will find an audience outside of this, solely on the premise that many people have been there, made it and got a t-shirt. also A large original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This could really be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the grass in the Welsh fields: it's a grower!
