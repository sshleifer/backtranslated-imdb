The man of the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy relates to a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds herself after a wild party ending at home with two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the feast was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up coming in. <br /> <br /> The man of the house was a pre-marker for Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred, who highlighted the 2 characters homeowners to Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the tune of the man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce), especially to get some of the best lines in the series. A semi-normal character was Larry (Doug Fisher) an unusable person who was always on scrounge and only came around when he wanted to borrow something (and never return it). <br /> <br /> The Americans made a version called Three Company, but it doesn't stand a chance over this much more fun original. Thames took the risk of producing a comedy about a man who shares an apartment with 2 women at a very conservative time, but they should worry as the assessments at that time indicate that about 20 million people would just see a good old-fashioned comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. What a shameful modern comedy cannot reach the high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on network DVD
