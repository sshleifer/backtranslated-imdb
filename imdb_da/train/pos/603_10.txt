Albeniz music permeates this movie. Sometimes it is played with original instrumentation (eg piano, but never full orchestra), but it is often reworked with different simultaneous ensembles (eg guitar) and treatments (eg jazz piano). Only occasionally is the music the only focus of the movie: the vast majority of the time is the music set for different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 12 ?? 14 scenes that are not united by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights of a single viewer. In my case, half reached the height, although the rest was very fine in its own way. Those who worked for me moved me to goat's aesthetic pleasure; Finally, the final scene left me laughing with joy. And in a very magical way you bring yourself deep into Spanish culture. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The movie is almost wordless, although each scene carries a title on an Albeniz piece. Watching this very beautiful movie cuts my complaint that almost none of Saura's movies are available on DVD in the United States. I am thinking in particular of his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs will not play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
