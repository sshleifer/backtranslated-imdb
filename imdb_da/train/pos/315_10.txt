I absolutely LOVED this soap. It has been one of my favorites. Would highly recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. I am very sorry that soap ended, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who haven't seen it, see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how it turned out at the end of the bad guys. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long-life love. I can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica has been by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you all like it too.
