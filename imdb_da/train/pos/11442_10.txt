<br /> <br /> So I'm not a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, as he creates the beauty of nature in his own work, is captivating. Watch him keep swirls in a web hanging from a tree in close-up for a few minutes while talking about his work and then receiving the payout when the camera cuts to the wide shot. Be amazed by the ease with which he works, and then realize it in vain when a light breeze knocks down all the way. <br /> <br /> The genius of Goldsworthy apparently knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the significant change of nature that his work, even though it is complete in its own sphere, is made entirely.
