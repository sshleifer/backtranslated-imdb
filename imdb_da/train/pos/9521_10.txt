I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons, but these are some of them 1) The good play of Tom and Tyler 2) Brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3) I thought the end was a good twist because I never expected in the end All credit to Sam Mendes.as as well as a these 3 point movie movie form is also good. I am a college film student and we studied this film in detail and it was one of the best movies I've seen for many years. I would like to say a big thank you to all the people involved in making this movie. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the machine gun scene where John Rooney is killed. It's just sheer shine to shoot the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad it's you" it's much better how I think, because the viewer creates their own sound and that the sound is completely different for every viewer just brilliant. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk aged 16
