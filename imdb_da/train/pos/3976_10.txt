I've just seen Drugs Years on VH1, and I love it. I think it reflects the drug process very well and most importantly it is a strong message for all generations. There is woodstock, Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison's death, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It covers entirely the timeline and development of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators, for it is precisely what is to be played on the TV these days. I'm waiting for the DVD release. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is amazing - BIG TIME!
