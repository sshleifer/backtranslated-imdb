This is what I call a growth film. Each character is different and better at the end - and that's all because a woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "vessel of love". Josie Lawrence, best known as a comedienne, really shines like the woman who creates all those changes. Even the men in this movie go from being self-centered to better men. The book was very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book when I am a librarian. The landscape breath and the love message are genuine.
