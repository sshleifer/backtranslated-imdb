The show was amazing, the costumes provided a unique feel to the period and was a Victorian living historian, I was impressed with the accuracy and attention to detail of the weapon. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie, but to understand the events and attitudes of time, you'll require a bit of basic historical knowledge. Don't expect as some pretty stupid people do, any of the characters have the Auzzie accent as we know it, at that time it was a country of childhood. Ok, the story had some elements of fiction, but these are needed for a wider sequel to the movie. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature of the DVD that he wanted his movies to "inspire an interest" and that's exactly what happened to me so this movie gets the thumbs up here. See it and you won't be sorry
