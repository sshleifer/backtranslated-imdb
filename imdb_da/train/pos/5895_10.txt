I had read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before I watched this movie. I am always fascinated by a story of hope and overcoming life that changes events, and that was no exception. The background for the characters given gives you a sense of family proximity and how they positively affected each other's life. I cannot speak with the accuracy of specific details in this movie, it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script. But the other in Dan and his family is what matters here. <br /> <br /> It's a worthy movie of a story to tell. I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end.
