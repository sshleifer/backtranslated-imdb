I've seen the restored or any version for that matter by "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she has been knocked out of her own father since she was 14! Then he still blows up and he kills abandoned Lily (Stanwyck) alone for her black girl Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) decide to use his sex to get to the top. She does it in good style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a pudgy clerk to enter the ground floor and continues to go through men's one-time candy! You dump your fianc√© and kill his nearest father-in-law, also Lily's sugar father, and commit suicide! Lily blinks hard! STANwyck is great as a girl who really doesn't know what love is. <br /> <br /> So in Paris, she falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry but when in deep economic straight bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, she realizes she loved the Court! Lily runs to find him, but will she be late? <br /> <br /> This is pre-code Hollywood at best. Stanwyck is huge and the look and music of the movie is perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored girl with an amoral woman, those who did not like the ultra-romantic fate movies, would not like Baby FAce better, those with faith in sex, love and power will love it. Highly recommended! See it!
