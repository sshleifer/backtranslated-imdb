Antonio Margheriti's "Danza Macabra" / "Blood Castle" is a creepy, atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts. It looks quite beautiful in black and white and it has wonderfully scary gothic vibe. Alan Foster is an English journalist pursuing an interview to visit American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe.Poe Betting Foster that he cannot spend a night in Poe's friend, Thomas Blackwood's abandoned mansion. By accepting the effort, Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins! The movie is extremely atmospheric and it scared hell out of me. The encryption sequence is really scary and the excitement is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as a vicious ghost Elisabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 60s. a masterpiece!
