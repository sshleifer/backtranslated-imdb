I just got back from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of ZU. I thought it kicked a * s! It was so creative and unique. It's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Although some thought there was too much FX (yes, right!), You can't complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so nice !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks a * s !!!!!!!!
