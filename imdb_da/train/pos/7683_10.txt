I LOVED good times with the rest of many of you. I love to read INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL comment. The writers on this show were amazing and the actors were talking outside. To answer Strawberry22 (the cleanest comment on the other overall and positive comment) ... What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a truck accident or car accident) and that was it horrible episode (when it first aired and I was a little thing ... it was so sad for me ..). Florida and the kids actually get out of the projects and become even neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the very first show ended. <br /> <br /> All the kids achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending, and I was crying because I loved them, and the show seemed so realistic that I actually believed in their destiny. I hope this kind of ending is really calling in fact for many. A great show and many other amazing shows followed, including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was a fantastic time for African American television and the best writers were amazing at the time. TV COUNTRY is Awesome for the memories and I just love it because I can't stop the junk we see today. SOMEBODY ... bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly ... your intelligent viewers are a dying race here and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, a TV COUNTRY original sitcom junkie from the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the family" ... that was the days ......
