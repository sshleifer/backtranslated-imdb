I'm definitely not in the audience for this movie. I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film. This happened quite accidentally with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about the movie were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local book and said that one of his influences was Clerks, I began to become interesting. When he said his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I watched DVD a week before, I decided to go check it out. The result could be described in the same way as Clerks, although the two films are not content. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome by fantastic writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing at all in his life and is afraid to ask hard questions about himself and his situation, less like me is a man who apparently forces himself to be constantly busy, He is always running some way and filling his life with little things, so he never has to handle the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and exciting. I can tell from looking at it that not much has changed since I grew up, young men still have the same problems they always have. The author dresses these issues and themes in modern peoples, crafting wonderfully honest characters, and has them absolutely credible things. As for the indie cinema, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view it is very close.
