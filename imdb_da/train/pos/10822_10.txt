I was lucky enough to see this movie many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since, but I've never forgotten this. Although Sinatra played a not very loving character, he was excellent in the role. Many seemed to think that he really did not enter his own until his role in "From Here To Eternity", but in my opinion he was magnificent in Concho. The other role that sticks to my heart is William Conrads. I would never see or hear about him before this movie. Conrad plays an amazing role in this movie. I remember his deep and gravel voice and he uses it beautifully to improve the few words he speaks with a threat that sets the tone of his character. I also remember the music that both introduces Conrad and and seems to surround him when he looks. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never got the chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the earth's surface. I see in the titles that it says that the film is black and white, but when I saw it, it was actually in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
