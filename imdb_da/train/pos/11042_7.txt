In a prison, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche) who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; Drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégée, the delayed Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old magazine hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use the content to escape the prison when they find the truth about Danver's fate. "Maléfique" is an original, exciting and claustrophobic French low budget horror movie. The story is practically in the same place, has no clichés and chops the viewer to the last scene. I am a big fan of French cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but I noticed that I have recently seen some good French horror movies, such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants," Belphegor "and" Dead End ". My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of the Evil")
