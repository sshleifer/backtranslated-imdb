Lupine is leaving for Morocco and is looking for a legendary treasure. His only link is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It is a lovely second location for Lupine, with the desert and the warm exotic atmosphere. An interesting thing about this movie is that the Jigen has a much smaller role than normal, and is generally in a different place from Lupine. On the one hand, their classic dynamics are missing, but it is a change in pace. Plus, this way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the function she seduces lupine and us viewers. Then there is Lara, the judge of this special story, and she is quite sympathetic. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun difference to have. <br /> <br /> There is a very entertaining, successful ninja guy who is the best villain in this, and of course he has some good games with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata is of course also on a warpath here, in good shape. <br /> <br /> Almost much, it's a sliding tour with Lupine. The reason is average, and there are some slow spots, but all in all, this movie is a great pleasure. Enjoy.
