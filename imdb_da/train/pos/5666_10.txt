I loved this show when it was broadcast on television and was crushed when I found out that somebody somewhere decided it wasn't worth continuing! For years I hung on my copies of this show, those I had lost or had some tape to me. It is until now. The powers that were finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD, and I could finally get my eager little hands on the complete set. Which brings me to this part; The part about what this show is about. American Gothic is about good verses evil, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (it's Buck, with a B). He is a vicious sheriff in a small town in South Carolina who runs things he wants things to run and stop for nothing to recover. <br /> <br /> I felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had plenty of life back yet to be lived. I really hated when it was canceled, but that's the way it seems to go to me when I finally find something worth watching on television. Gary Cole did a good job as Sheriff Lucas Buck, he just got the right amount of charm verse evil to pull it out. The other actors also did a super job, so I think you could say that even the casting was a hit with me.
