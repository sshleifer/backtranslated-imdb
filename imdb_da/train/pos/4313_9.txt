Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category: It's a very smart movie, with very clever dialogues and food for thoughts everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that it has never done it, it is deserving ranking (and never will), because of it's simplicity. This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers. Shame believed that IMDb makes me write ten lines because that is by no means necessary in this particular case. At least to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weakness of the movie, if anything in the play: not that it is bad, but it could have been done much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline, which was perfect. Go ahead and see it.
