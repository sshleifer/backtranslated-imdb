An old man living in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He walks the forest to see a murder, but did he see the murder or lose it? Is he just getting old? The movie is so big because the viewer has to make their own minds on what is going on. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The second part I liked was the forest of the forests at the end of autumn and winter. They were beautiful, but the only thing I didn't like was the old man's view of his underwear. He could have tied the jacket a little tighter, but apart from that, it was a pretty deep movie.
