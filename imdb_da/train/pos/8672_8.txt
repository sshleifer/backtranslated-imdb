WWE's last PPV of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans, but only for a reason the ladder fight was only planned to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the latest crap PPV, which was December to Dismember, WWE knew it was necessary to do something to get the fans to talk again, it turned out useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the fight should be a ladder match. <br /> <br /> The battle was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I have ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a complete mess. Johnny Nitro didn't even control his partner, they just continued as nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the fight without hitting people with a few ladder shots. In the end, London and Kendrick retained the titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno battle when he set the MVP's stupid costume on fire. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero in a decent fight, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to maintain the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker ended with Finlay for taking on John Cena and Batista. The action was scary, and no one used to whom Batista picked for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall Results: Kane defeated the MVP in an inferno match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick maintained the WWE Take the team's titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder battle. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to preserve the American title in a decent fight. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible fight. Undertaker defeated Mr Kennedy in a last trip fight. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in a tremendous battle. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
