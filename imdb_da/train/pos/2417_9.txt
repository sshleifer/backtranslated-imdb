"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen, period. Sure, it's a little low budget, but it's a non-stop comic tour de force. There are lots of memorable quotes. For example, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says "Oh, I pull down anywhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh of course, it's Candy's delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns to a hilarious performance as a shabby film maker. A clip of his horrible low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So if you're a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can't recommend this movie enough.
