I own Ralph Bakshi's forgotten masterpiece Fire & Ice on an old OOP rental video tape. For one thing, it's better than any other Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? It stood the time test, and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons with modern fantasy epics like LOTR: PHOTO (though I love that movie.) <br /> <br /> The ground goes like this: After a fight between Fire & Ice, a king's daughter is kidnapped by Jarol's (Ice) subhuman creatures, while a single survivor in a sacrificial city rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, that doesn't sound like an original Betty nurse, but it's not the intention. It's really bringing to life an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Concerning the action scenes: superb. They are well handled, have a great suspension, and have lots of loud sounds. Just check the climate climate, now it's an end! <br /> <br /> The action and dialogue: competent. Really. They are not nominated for an Oscar, but they are OK and do not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Shot on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn, and although the cartoons feel a little 1-dimensional, they are OK. All in all, this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfishing "entertainment". 10.10
