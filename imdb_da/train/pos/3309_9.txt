This is a great movie. If this is an indication, the Hong Sang-Soo really is "Asian cinema best kept secret". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers much for the same reason as them thematic, but I think I actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single movie. The obvious minimalism is a little less pronounced here than in their work, although it still perfectly fits the style (the camera never moves once), and somehow I found the movie less self-conscious "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao -hsien, which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus, it doesn't keep the items as loose as Hou does. I felt that the movie was also more "complete" and less open (just barely) than any of their work, even though it wasn't saying it had much of something resembling a forward plot. I would have difficulty believing that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this movie for "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman wandering around herself and in the small hotel room carrying punk trousers don't seem to be familiar).
