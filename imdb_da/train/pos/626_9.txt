The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There is a saying, "Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievements dream." By exploring our imagination, we create our own futures. Or build empires. Maybe overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Get wisdom and benefit for humanity. Or (simply) just find the way to true love and happiness. Freud can express such things in symbols. The language of imagination. <br /> <br /> Tristan ventures out of a little Danish village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will show his love for Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he promises to bring back a falling star. <br /> <br /> Stormholding is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches will get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the nestlings is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who makes fabulous young old transformations of appearance and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a hard, swashbuckling pirate exterior, but is a cute closet queen downstairs. Stormhold's heirs are meanwhile engaged in a fight against inheriting the kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added addition. A buffoon trader throws in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's spirit purity awakens Yvine's love, so there is a nice little triangle going on. Until he reaches maturity to distinguish pedestal divas from real women. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a full-on large-scale fantasy that pervades its incredible stars. Quite positively, and written with a clarity that makes it worth more for psychoanalysis, a coven full of Harry Potter romps. The production values ​​rival Hollywood, and the story is free of racist stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas other than form and perverting so many large-scale fantasies. <br /> <br /> That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the adventure quality may be for saccharin for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this movie can give it. <br /> <br /> As a boy, I remember wondering about albums from Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far where I lived). They made records with names like "In search of the lost chord" and wrote texts like: "Thinking is the best way to travel." I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Design of dreams. Learning to make them real. Today, people can talk about NLP or positive thinking. Adults who remember to dream with the power of youth, but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still have that feeling? <br /> <br /> You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the largest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look as if they had a ball. Maybe you will too.
