I was always a big fan of this movie, first of all you have seen the cast, the play is great and helps make this movie move together very well. Cybill Shepherd got good reviews for his role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this movie begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets another shot in life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live her new life and forgets her past life, while Corinne tries to move on with her. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later, when he meets Corinse's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly flooded with a host of unwanted memories (this is where fun begins and embarrassing situations arise.) The music is amazing and the scenes are heart-felt and very sweet. You won't be disappointed if you give it a try, chances you'll like it. Very fun and sweet!
