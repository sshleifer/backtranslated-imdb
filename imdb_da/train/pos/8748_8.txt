I think that's what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or Damn Australian? I still don't know, but I know I really liked this movie, but it couldn't be my favorite movie! Great story with great actors, but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say 'Oh, she's so good'. Still, who made it? What really happened? Who is that guy? No answer to these questions ... Mysterious movies with a good brand overall ... I give it an 8/10 that goes on 8.5!
