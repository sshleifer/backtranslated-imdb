This is the first 10 out of 10 I've given any movie. What made this movie so good to me? Constant action - there are no slow parts, big-acting, smart writing. I also liked the movie style where skakiness and different angles just made it feel like you're part of the scene. Finally, I see an action movie not trying to please all sectors of the public (ie there is no compulsory romance). I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this movie, you will be filled with adrenaline and you may want to calm down a little before driving your car!
