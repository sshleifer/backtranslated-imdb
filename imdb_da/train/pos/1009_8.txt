Facts: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. How much you try to apologize to yourself or explain it. Stargate SG-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi TV series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas quickly. Special FX is not as impressive as they could have been, and the action will not blow you out of the chair. Or also couch. <br /> <br /> But this is where I really think that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get for every episode or stolen idea I think you can count on At least one cheesy sci-fi movies that are actually worse than an hour's TV episode. In fact, some episodes could probably have been 90 minutes long and have still been better than most movies. <br /> <br /> Being able to maintain this quality throughout the show and continue to deliver and push the story further, is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I'm very picky about my choices. I might follow one or two TV shows at most, and I have quite high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself trapped. So for those who decide to brush Stargate SG-1 yet another sticky sci-fi show, don't. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
