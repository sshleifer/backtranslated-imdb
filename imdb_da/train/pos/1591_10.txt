My mom and I have recently become addicted to this show and laugh at our beard! I have only seen about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I have not noticed this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story is very fun, the characters have really great personalities (or not so great, but they are still fun!). I TiVO every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all they threw, never leave me bored while you look! There is something unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parent's guide nearby, you shouldn't have too many problems. There is some kind of "Friends" type relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
