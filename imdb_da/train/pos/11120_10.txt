Wow. I LOVED the whole series and am shocked by comments from people who thought it ended badly. Perhaps it waved a little in seasons 4 & 5 while it stayed better than anything else on TV. But 6 and especially 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a gloomy mood, and Janice always has spectacular insight into family anxiety - the stupid line of knowing Toni's penchant for sitting and staring. Anyone who missed the consequences of it for the rest of the series doesn't know Tony. Melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric examination and its references to the sociopath's self-inflicting sentimentality on pets and animals goes back to the first episodes in the series, says Tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonating with Phil's "wave by-fare to his grandchildren before the coup in the grace of the last episode (not getting into Chase's dark humor). I could go on and on, but I just want to add that I thought last show - starting with Vanilla Fudge's opening tribes to supply the ironic foreshadow ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On "to the terminal moments when Tony returns to complacency with his family in tow or explodes as AJ's SUV or Phil's head was completely PERFECT. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a dying medium that pathologically delivers the "jack-off fantasies" AJ derides (and then in which he instantly lowers) a tip of pork cake to Mr. Chase.
