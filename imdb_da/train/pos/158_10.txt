I've seen this movie more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then - it's part of Petzold's game: he plays along with the genre's rules. It's very nice how the very unlikely story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet again in another, even more unlikely story, that the girls make up a casting. This film is a journey between facts and fiction, it is about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or maybe going on in the future than it is about actual ongoings. It is a reverie, kind - so apt enough there are many motives, Freud could have found interesting for his dream analysis, just like all the "doppelganger" constellations. <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" can be interesting to look at compared to the current Asian cinema of the eerie: Petzold's everyday city architecture also feels haunted in a discreet, oddly known way. This movie is not about the obvious. Describing it as a story of two girls meeting and eventually becoming friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother seeking Europe for her lost daughter, doesn't say much about "Gespenster".
