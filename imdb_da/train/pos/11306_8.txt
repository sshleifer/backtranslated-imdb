An unfortunate social condition triggers the disaster: A poor Giovanna has ended in the brink, but still has an ace on her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a rental nurse who has got hold of the gas station, has been for years, picking her up from the street and offering her bed and home along with her clumsy love. But the physical contact to which Giovanna is now exposed only gives her feelings of disgust, and so she does not see a charity in him, but a plague she must get rid of. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally gives her the longest opportunity. And you don't have to ask her twice: At the first meeting she gives him the feeling of being physically wanted, and a little while later she lets him seduce her without giving any resistance. <br /> <br /> The development partnership, however, must undergo the strict rules of Giovanna. Gino's longing for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the site with Giovanna and start a new life far from phatos is being pushed aside. Giovanna aims at another goal: to have Bragana killed, to inherit and to collect the insurance premium. Gino degenerates into her hands into a self-sacrificing tool. To be complete for the benefit of this woman, he becomes a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, he asks the crime committed at a moral level. The very takeover of Bragana's place, which involves sleeping in a bed of death, causes a deep disgust for itself. And later, after finding out about the upcoming payment of insurance money and seems to look through Giovanni's cunningly planned plan, he also performs a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in a prostitute's arms. <br /> <br> If Visconti's movie ended at this time, it could easily be classified as a judgmental portrait of a cool, calculative and conscientious woman with a little touch of social criticism. But then the last sequences make this carefully constructed construction of ideas collapse. Finally, Giovanna feels disturbing about what she has done, and by the uncompromising revelation of her inner feelings she manages to attack the new Gino's love. Her violent death in an absurd traffic accident not only leaves him helpless for the benefit of any destiny. It also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters should be made responsible for their disaster. The culprit is just the state of a society that determines the individual's path unchanging right from the start. <br /> <br />
