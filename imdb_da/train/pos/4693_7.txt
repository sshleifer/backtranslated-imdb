Johnny dangerously falls into hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> Casting is similar; Michael Keaton was an excellent comic book before he took himself too seriously as the years went by. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and get a lot of laughs from me. But the complete scene steals here is Richard Dimitri (sneak the word "Iceholes" in film history) as a mobster who dares best by murdering the English language. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this movie, which I saw quite often, so I'm likely to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster movie spoof that even relaunches some well-meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
