While the prices have gone a lot and some of the details have been dated, every homeowner who has struggled with housing property problems must get many chuckles out of this movie. I know I did. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, a New York announcer, decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build a nice house there. He enters a hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to litigation to construction problems, as the cost and schedule of the construction is escalating out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig hundreds of feet, but never find water. A few more steps away, a few days later, the basement of his domestic floods! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances when the harried pair of couples overwhelmed with problems they had never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend. The only warning is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much extra trouble she is causing and there is a black girl (horror!). Then do not watch the movie through the social lens in 2003 and you will enjoy it all the more. <br /> <br />
