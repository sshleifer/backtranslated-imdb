This movie has very good effect on almost every cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, good music and excellent visual images without significant special effects. It is interesting to note, though, as so much science fiction, its predictions for the future are unlikely to happen as early as depicted. It is not to say that we are out of the woods yet, but 2022 is of course too early to be in this state. It shares that with a fairly illustrated list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: A Space Odyssey (compares its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's" I Robot "(positronic brains should have been invented in 1990 ' s).
