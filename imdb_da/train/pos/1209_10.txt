In a time of such horrible cartoons, I'm a bit shocked to watch a movie with such good morals make it the IMDB bottom line for animated movies. This movie is contrary to the first one. I don't want to deny it. But when I was in the audience for this movie, I didn't even notice, nor would it matter if I did. The people who have made it may have used "New Generation" to note that this is another way that Care Bear Family could have begun. Maybe we should decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie aged 3-6 and it didn't scare me or confused me at all. <Br /> <br />
