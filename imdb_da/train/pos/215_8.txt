The word "classic" is thrown too loosely today, but this film deserves the appeal. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor), and the late regretted George Burns make a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to consider what the movie would have been that had not died prevented Jack Benny from playing George Burns' part as planned. As it is, the recovery scene in Matthaus's apartment is probably not surpassed as a side divider. Definitely one of my desert movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
