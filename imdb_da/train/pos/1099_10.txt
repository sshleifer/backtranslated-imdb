Although it is recognized as the best filming of the difficulties in having a house in the country built (or purchased) for your specifications, it is not the first or the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were leading the movie version of the GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE comedy by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. About fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE PONE PIT. The former was about moving into an 18th century country house that ... needs work. The latter was about building your dream home - in the late 1980s. Though the two films have their moments, both are not as good as ROLLS, which were based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment that they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising consultant (in 1948 he makes $ 15,000 a year, which was like making $ 90,000.00 today) and living in a luxury apartment - like in New York City on that day he rents! - He feels they should look for something better. He and Muriel enter the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both can imagine can be attached as the dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall into the economic wormhole that land and building purchases can bring. For one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of ​​building a home like this, they fail to warn after warning their wise, cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucks his chops quietly) with a check before double checking the correct price for the land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he is paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the country than it is worth. There are problems with the water supply that both blends just never think of, such as hard and soft water - leading to the Zis-Zis water softener. They find that the patterns they have in mind, and have worked with their architect (Reginald Denny), cannot be chosen cheaply for a moment by Muriel's decisions to build a little smoking that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The escalating cost of the project is a question that bedevils Jim. He has been appointed to handle the "Wham" account ("Spam" had become a popular result of World War II, as the public began using it as a meat substitute in view of the success of the armed forces). Jim cannot address this (he is not alone - one or two other leaders fumbled in front of him). He comes up with the following bit of "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little piggy went on the market, <br /> <br /> he was pink and as beautiful as ham. <Br <br /> <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> when he gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up as "Wham"! "< <br /> <br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needs a right jacket when he reads it! <br /> <br /> Jim is also increasingly suspicious of Bill's attention to Muriel, though (in this case) Bill is harmless. But he's always around (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the bright-haired, and that he keeps Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have accidents, the best is when they are locked in a room in the half-house, just as the men have left the day. They can't open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to break the door down by a make-shift battering ram. He breaks a window and the door opens itself. <br /> <br /> The movie seems quite satisfying, with all the actors apparently enjoying themselves. It's a movie that (despite changes in the price level and wage level) really doesn't at all. Most Americans usually dream of owning their own home and always have. <br /> <br /> Many years ago, a paint company made a nice scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell about the paint job Parnell's company has to do in the different rooms. She carefully shows the different shades of red, blue, etc. she wants - even a polite Parnell gives a single thread for the right shade of blue. The advertisements suggested that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your painting work. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the advertising introduction. You can imagine how the unclear Parnell handles the situation afterwards, when Loy leaves him with his crewmember.
