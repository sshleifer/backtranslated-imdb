I was not quite sure whether this would just be another of those idiotic night life soaps that seem to touch prime time, but as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (not small thanks to talented casting). Four female friends with different backgrounds meet and share the weekly unfolding of their love life. The hour-long program follows each of them separately through their often-turned quest to find love and it does so without being boring or tired. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is the homemaker 1 (supposedly widowed after September 11), who gets a little preaching and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see Small back at t.v. when she was fantastic in "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The chicken can shop. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most corrupted but still very sympathetic to the women as she breaks with her friendly but self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") in his driven desire to have child with her, whatever her needs. The last two members of the cast are the rushing Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with everyone and everyone, sex not specifically, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish) a deeper doctor who is affair with a patient AND his son has sent his career and love life budding without control. That said, I am hooked now and hope the BBC continues to cranking this series because it is good, it is different and it has a great cast.
