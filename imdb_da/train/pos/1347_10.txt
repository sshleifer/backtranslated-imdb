Huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema as seen through Martin Scorcan's eyes. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment throughout its 4-hour running time. Many genres, periods and directors are all examined, discussed more from the perspective of cinephiles than modern instructors. For everyone even distant interested in American movies or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
