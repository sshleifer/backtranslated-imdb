I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80s and 90s. I saw Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19. <br /> <br /> And I found it fun. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks something "dated" I can be quite fun 30 years later .... think again! It's fun even if you have no idea how the 70s were, and the idea of ​​bell-bottom pants makes you hug. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown-type who reads adult literature? There is plenty to laugh at. The scrotal doll show at the end is the best.
