I haven't seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I've seen a few haunting clips that have left me gagging to see everything. One sequence remains in my memory for this day. A (very convincing) spacecraft is encircled to the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash unit to photograph the hidden surface beneath him. The moon flashes for visibility. . . . And in a few seconds it is. Parallel lines, squares, may it be .. so the light falls and the brief glimpse of ... what ... has gone and it's time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've also seen some other clips, but would LOVE getting the full movie.
