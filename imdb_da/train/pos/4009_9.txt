Children - regardless of age - will not know about their parents' sex life. And adult children are often seriously confused and confused by any evidence that aging parents have an active libido. Finally, many movie guests are very uncomfortable seeing a dowdy, frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere, discovering her painfulness and the need for raw passion with a beautiful man half year. <br /> <br /> "The Mother" is a provocative look at a barely filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, sees the "telly" and vegetates for her husband for almost three decades, and one Controlling dominant robe on it wraps it in with a massive heart attack. May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in their own way. The male son lives with a beautiful wife who might drive him to bankruptcy with his extravagant commercial venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a teacher with ambitions to succeed as an author. She is attractive, not beautiful, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first. <br /> <br /> Back to her house after burying her husband, May decides not to stay there. Rejects typical widower with her legacy of boring days and no adventure she goes to stay with Paula, who has a young son. Paula's girlfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a robust handsome contractor who seems to take a very long time to complete an addition to the May son's house. May is quite with hard-drinking, coke-sniffing the bastard whose treatment of paula should have warned May that he was sure of a guy by the royal academy of cads. <br /> <br /> What follows is a dry affair between Darren and the occupied and now bubbly living (dare I say reborn?) widow. The love scenes are graphic, but take second place for amateur artist Mays pen and ink sketches of their trysts, which then play a role in the embracing drama (or debacle, select). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon with well over half the audience in corn age. That some were shocked or disturbed to see her being subject to erotic surrender in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement. <br /> <br /> This dazzling honest look at an elderly woman's awakened passion after decades of observing her husband's desire to stay home and raise children (she also mentions that he didn't like her having friends - what a guy surpasses a number of problems. While May's dalliance with Darren does not constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and problems with a mother bedding her daughter love. And Paula is not made of the very best things to begin with. The case, when revealed, gives the opportunity to peel the mother-daughter relationship, which, in Paula's view, left something to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love - she has not been handled a terrible hand of life, but neither is it a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May be strong in her decision that both recognize her sexuality and expect, in fact, demanding a future for happiness. But she is also inevitable vulnerable. She fishes in unknown emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand, much less determination. During her sixties, she is still working. <br /> <br /> "Something must be given" recently exhibited mature sexuality, but in an entertaining antiseptic way that ensures no viewer would become unpleasant. After all, it is Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton who cavorting in the rich. And to ensure that no serious psychosocial problems were explored, Keaton's young girlfriend Amanda Peet, daughter of Keaton, knows not only the fight, but ensures that the audience knows she and her old will happily never jump into bags. <br /> <br /> Not easy out here. Anne Reid's inspired performance strengthens discomfort in some cases while he respects others. Her naked body bursts sexuality for some and seems absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (comments from the audience leaving today reflect all of these views). Kudos to Director Roger Michell to tackle a fascinating story of enlistment and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
