"My left foot" is a beautiful impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was paralyzed with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body he had control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this movie, which I am not sure was deserved, but still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this movie is that it is a bit too real at times. When Brown is in desperation and needs to help someone and do everything with his left foot, the movie can be hard to see. This gives it an often depressing feeling that can turn some viewers off for a while. But if you look beyond that, you'll see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have disabilities and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not paralyzed and still consider ourselves having problems are inspired by this movie, because if anything with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well made, occasionally comfortable, but hard to see. Don't be for everyone, but not at all bad. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
