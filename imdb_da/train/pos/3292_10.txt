Paperhouse is the most moving and exciting movie I've ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie" this I think is a serious mistake. Some journo once called the "thinking person's nightmare on Elm Street" and while I accept the logic of his conclusion, I cannot help but believe it is a badly deserved and misleading mark. Those who can only see scares really miss here and only serve to demonstrate that they are not thinking at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, trying to classify this wonderful work is just a bad idea. Simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, "the movie hits you at a very emotional level," which can go a bit to explain why my comments are so accidentally gushing. To be honest, I do not apologize for this, so if you feel that my words are too saccharin for your taste, stop reading now because there is more to come. It is so rare to find a movie that has its heart's childhood pain and heartache and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual is finding child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting, and Paperhouse's lasting influence is due to their ability to portray melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a hassle-free and convincing manner. <br /> <br /> And yet, both these brilliant young stars seemed to have gone through the study's grip and somehow faded away. Add to this all an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative movies and the most beautiful and scary soundtrack you will ever hear, and you can begin to get a cold of why I have such love and belonging to this movie that there no word to express. <br /> <br />
