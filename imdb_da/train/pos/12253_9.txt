This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an eastern novel. Although definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful television version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is a good one, as the unnecessary snobble that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by a person much more akin to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to depict the roles were well-chosen. Kate Beckinsale goes the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow's '96 version. Samantha Morton's sparse blonde locks fit her attitude and character, as the simple one that accompanies his role in earlier characterizations is replaced by Harriet, we know from the book. Mister Knights role is performed very well in my opinion; both the serious and the gentle compassion that the hero has painted in the novel are present here in this very neglected, lavish film.
