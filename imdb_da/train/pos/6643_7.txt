When I heard that this movie came out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before I saw the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been very different to me if I hadn't read the book. The writers actually did a good job of being true to the book's main drawing, with minor differences, of course. I think what disappointed me most about the movie was Boyle, who played the role of Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie, she always tries to use her lumpy lips and dark makeup eyes to make herself seem super sexy. In fact, I think the movie was true to the real fragility of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so strange if the son was killed in Iraq, and in the current events, Casey Sheehan, whose mother was on a huge anti-Iraq tirade). Of course, in the book, the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house beat the video of the son in the helicopter, I was really scared. Overall, I was impressed with the film, as it followed the book very well.
