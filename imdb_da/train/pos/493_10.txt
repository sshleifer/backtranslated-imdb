I've been a Star Trek fan as long as I can remember. When they announced planning and premiere in the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect setting and a well-functioning job done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginning of what many people have come to love. Scott Bakula was just as superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a forthcoming performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That only two people in this wonderful new crew will boldly take us into Starfleet's great story. The company looks like it will be a good series that is worth looking at and I recommend it. See it.
