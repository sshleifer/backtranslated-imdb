Lizzie Borden's love crimes are an important film that deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity that surely beats the male friendliness). It flirts with sadomasochism, and the captivity falls in love with captor theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes low and shaken, but Borden has traveled far beyond feminist dogma in women who gain power through their insatiable desire. <br /> <br /> A striking scene exposes the female fetish to horses when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, seduces an elderly woman wearing pants by asking her to show her how to run a horse. He pushes a riding stove between his legs and pushes it against her steps, and it greatly increases her excitement. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the designer, and even though he is far from beautiful, he chooses Janes and has enough on-screen presence to make one believe that the women could swallow their line. At all reports, Sean Young shows a weird person and she is hardly beautiful. Yet, her intense face and long-lasting slender body and accentuated hips and periodically heterogeneous movements of this film as an erotic advocate for erotic fascination alchemy. Her performance is powerful and complex. The table has an exciting world view, and I really appreciate the fact that it stands so unlike the modern, feckless jealousy.
