Many of the user's comments I've seen on IMDB for this movie don't do it right. Let me first say that this film should not be taken seriously. It must be a fun, but stupid movie that doesn't require you to think just to enjoy it. If you see this movie with the intention of watching a masterpiece in either film or humor, then you will be very disappointed. But if you just want to see a greasy movie with some talented actors / actresses and some good fishing sets, then you will enjoy it.
