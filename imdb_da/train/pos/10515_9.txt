A small, charming little film to be safe, but a beautifully designed. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase of her British accent, and thrown around her whole lap up the dialogue. This came out at the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why that one got all of Oscar's attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least heavy story, well told.
