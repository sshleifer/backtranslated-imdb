Occasionally, this film is released, which no one has ever heard of and was shot in a very short time with very little money and resource, but everyone is crazy and turns out to be surprisingly beautiful. This also happened in the 50s with very few small films that not many people have ever heard of. There are really some unknown big, surprisingly small jewels from the 50's that are worth digging out. "Panic in the Streets" is another movie like what jumps to the mind. Both are films that do not really resemble the usual genre flicks of their time and are also made with limited resources. I was really surprised at how much I ended up suffering from this movie. It was really a movie that got better and better when it evolved. Like all 'old' movies, it tends to be slow, but when you get into the story, and it's a sign you're in for a real treat with this movie. The film has a really good story It involves espionage, even if the film does not start like that. It begins as this typical criminal thriller with a touch of film noir to it. But "Pickup on South Street" is just not really a movie of the numbers, so it starts taking its own directions very soon. It ensures that the film remains a surprising but above all really refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys and they all have their shortcomings and weaknesses. Really human. It also has a fantastic performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. It has really been one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen. Although it is somewhat obvious low budget, it is simply a large, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
