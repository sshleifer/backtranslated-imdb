This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too fun to be a thriller, even though it was a bit exciting. There are many nice one-liners and fun situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does a good job. The rest of the cast is also not half bad, and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. The story can become pretty confusing at times, as new characters appear under the movie. Things become more complicated as no one rarely tells the truth about things. If you don't pay attention, it may be a bit messy in the end, but I really liked it. Louis Morneau is not so well known, but he has done an OK job with this and I never became really impatient while I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Men are worth checking out.
