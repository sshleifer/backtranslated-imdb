"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br/> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Contributors: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity today is getting a biopic made about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of these to be released on DVD. It has Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin-up model, Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with some extracts in color. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", this movie won't be the one to watch out for the Oscar this year. This movie lacks the emotional resonance shown in other biopics, and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or suggested. However, this does not mean that it is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying film - a solid cinematic work. This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. It's filmed with joy and care, and Mary Harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period that most filmmakers only dream of. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an icon ?? or a simple porn star? Do you know her. She is a woman who had only a very profound influence on American culture by revealing more skin than was appropriate at that time. Now most know her as one of America's first gender symbols - a legend to many models, especially Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived at a time when only an empty meat was shown during the waste, could have arrested, and Side's bondage-style photos were just what was supposed to push the American public into a rebellion. In fact, the images launched a comprehensive senate survey on common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances in "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that immediately jumps into mind when I think of great ideas. Now it will. She followed the role completely and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance. David Strathairn is fresh from last year's "Good Night, Good Luck", where he gave one of 2005's best performances. Here he gives another good performance even though he is a little underused. I was shocked at how very limited his screen time was ?? But quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was in "The Haunting" (1999). While most ignored the movie, I found it an enjoyable, if not superficial, horror movie, and I have always believed Taylor was completely credible as the emotionally confused Nell. Here Taylor gives another credible performance. She gives a very poor performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After all, I was told that "The Notorious Bettie Page" is not comparable to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is incomparable with these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end. Her personal life is briefly implied, but it really is her influence on the world that becomes the highlight. We see the film knowing that Page will ultimately shave everyone and we know the influence that her decisions will have, but we are rarely shown what influence they will have on her personal life. She is a woman who never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. She was an adult model who became a Christian missionary. This movie does not dramatize anything more. It could have included fictitious moments when Sides were hysterically hoping and asking God to forgive her. It could have shown that Page is running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of her past ?? and yet it does not. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and it is something rare in today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing. Finally thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with amazing movies. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
