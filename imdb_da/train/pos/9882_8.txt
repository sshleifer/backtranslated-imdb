Currently on METOO's new schedule at. 16 on weekdays, just after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> Don't know if I actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really fascinated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical vest. A kind of "naked city" of western. <br /> <br /> And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (like a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, Yet Ann Robinson ("World of War"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a monster from outer space") /> <br /> It ran for eight seasons , over 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the trail leader Gil Favor, the most trusted man ever lived, honoring a samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and openness. I would vote for him for President every day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood is pretty striking as his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates . Also veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal "One-eyed, One-Horned, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley is there as spicy scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you can ask as "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> Then there's the great theme song performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between it and the "Maverick" theme, I have Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to each episode; I gather the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo-wing experience) is always guaranteed as one is waiting to see if the boys will have their difficulties straightened out before commercially. "Rollin ', rollin' roll in..."
