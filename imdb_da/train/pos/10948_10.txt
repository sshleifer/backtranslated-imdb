After a sitcom plot it is so fun to have your character at the same time operating both inside and outside the context that the rest of the molding is in is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms really could use. The supporting characters put the show in a sitcom reality, giving a contextual counterpart to Sarah's erratic persona, which, in addition to general insensitivity, has no specific recurring features for behavioral expectations to base on, making her less a character than a canvas, Each episode must be painted, if not the scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to normally go unnoticed. Every time she speaks, it is like an independent 5-second shit. She overemotes a lot that shows the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can mean, but never sticks with an idea that long enough to make you comfortable and form expectations that will be fulfilled. This can be the most creative, original and experimental television program ever.
