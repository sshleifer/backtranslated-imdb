The last time I saw the movie, I was about seven years old, so my opinions could be combed over time. At that time, I enjoyed the movie, which switched between cartoon and live action. At that time I felt sorry for the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt happy when Captain Contagious kidnapped the hero (a princess or toy shepherd) the tables they were beaten to him. Unfortunately, manufacturers have never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have is twenty-year-old memories. I'm sure if I saw the movie again, I'd consider it corny and sappy, but I really enjoyed the movie at that time.
