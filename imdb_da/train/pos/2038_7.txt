This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be nonsense so I didn't expect much. But I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not take good care of the maid and did not care if she lived or died. After a while she certainly grew on me and became a nice character. It's not just some slasher movies where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the movie, but explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure just watch it anyway, it's only an hour and a half in your life. You still have to live for 80 years.
