It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable movie from the early sound ear in the form of one that can be used for ordinary film commentary. At times, there is almost a desperation, as many movie people in the quiet era try their wings in the sound, and fear that they will be left off the road (as with some), Rin-Tin-Tin. however, it was naturally natural. In such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some were sure to stand out John Barrymore's soliloquy from Richard II is for one moment definitely worth preserving. On the whole, only those with previous stage training excluded trust. But this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for "movie buffs" that are particularly interested in the silent sound transition
