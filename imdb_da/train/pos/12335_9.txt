Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible action. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are very timber. Ney lies in bed, dies of arsenic poisoning, with each hair in place. But the film is so juicy and so exciting. More faithful to the book than most movies in its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an arrogance that was just as shocking - I'm not fun, kids) was a master stroke. She is just her usual Joan Fontainey herself. As murderers supposed, she dies by dropping "feet most through the floor into an empty room."
