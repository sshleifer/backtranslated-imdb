I recently (May 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I've seen a lot of high quality movies since the 1970s (I was 10 in 1978)), this three-episode, low budget thing is still strong. <br /> <br /> What's funny, it's fun I've seen it with my 10-year-old daughter, and she's experiencing the same thing I remember from then: The creepy music (she had to hold my hand, even whether she has traveled to see LotR and Resident Evil), the eternal change theories of who the sinner actually is, and also complain about the theatrical voices of an era before Norway discovered the difference between stage and film acting. <br /> <br /> This is the only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's still worth seeing.
