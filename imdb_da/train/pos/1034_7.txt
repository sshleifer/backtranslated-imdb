I think this movie was probably much more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, but today it seems a little too preaching and static to raise it to greatness. The film was set in 1940 - just before the United States entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding prisoners. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. When the movie begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the United States, and for the first time this year they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was also perfect and too decent - making them seem a blatantly positive propaganda rather than a real family suffering from real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems false today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by the children did not ring really. It sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than real children's voices. As a result, they were extremely annoying - especially the smallest who came from, sometimes as a sudden. About the only ones that sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian who lived with them (though he had no visible accent). It's really hard to believe that ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the game of his lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic story idea and plot is good, but the dialogue is just bad at times. All in all, an interesting curio and a movie with some good moments, but it's really about everyone.
