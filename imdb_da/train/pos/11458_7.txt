Greetings again from the dark. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who has to work ... regardless of the conditions, otherwise his reason for living will cease. To see Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he has to - not for money or fame. It is his life force. When you see his failures, energy seems to expel from his body as a widespread balloon. It's not the fear to start again, it's that he takes his energy from his work. Seeing him create just for taking over nature and remembering his work is something painful, yet breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialogue, and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. When he says he needs the earth, but he doesn't need it ... I ask to depart. Only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down another pace that at best relaxes.
