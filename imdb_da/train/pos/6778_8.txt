A fondly-remembered melodrama ?? thanks first of all to Ronald Colman's fine Oscar-winning central achievement ?? about an often-treated theme: the nature of action and how it can overcome its perception of reality. In this case, we have a well-known thespian tackling Shakespeare's "Othello" so that the film's last third dives effectively into the thriller genre ?? with the press release Edmond O'Brien (which happened to be saddened by Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso) 'examines' the possible engagement of the actor in the desdemona-like burnout of a celebrity waitress (a very slim Shelley Winters). The theatrical / New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war period is greatly captured by the spouse's acting play by Garson Rabbit and Ruth Gordon and legendary "acting director" George Cukor (all of whom were recognized by the Academy with nominations); moreover, the film nabbed another Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score. Colman, always the suave leading man blessed besides with a velvety voice, does it well enough by Shakespeare ?? getting the conviction the longer his character slips into obsessive jealousy, a murderous rage, and finally paranoia; However, he has not been let down by a supportive cast, which also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle part is a little strained, the film poses any shortcomings with a remarkably handled expressionist denouement.
