The Baghdad Thief is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian evenings, comes from Disney Corporation, the thief of Baghdad held their interest in the end. The story moves together at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teenage actors in appeal and judges from the number of times I heard my eldest daughter say, "He is c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the movie Oscars won for film and special effects. Today, these effects are, of course, very dated ("Look, it is Barbie flying through the air", my daughter declared by the genius flight). Yet they fit well into the story. The film is over 60 years old. The effects fit the script. Moreover, what looks in The Bag of Baghdad has remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next 25 years. You only have to compare opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> This qualifies as a family movie, although there are a few stabbings near the end. The action is so obvious, and the wounds are as bloodless as the scenes that are almost as artificial as animation. All in all, a fun movie is worth looking at either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
