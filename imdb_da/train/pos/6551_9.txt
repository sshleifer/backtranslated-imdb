I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought: Even if I don't read the books, it doesn't look like Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it wasn't a copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, change it to become a big screen entertainment. The plot was fun and exciting with many scary actions, and I thought Emma Roberts was truly credible in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several fun moments and unlike many statements, Nancy in no way comes in this movie like a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing that this movie also did well was the balance of all things with a mix of comedy, romance, excitement and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you are smart and decide to trust me and see it here, be prepared for some scary which heck moments because I was like freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to own this movie! I also love Emma Roberts now. She is like a mini Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
