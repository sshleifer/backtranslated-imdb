The film is not visually amazing in the conventional sense. It does not present a number of beautiful pictures. Instead, it is a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly treat or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots. This kind of thing is easy to try, but difficult to succeed. The film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less-than-fully-committed viewer know what is going on. Instead, the film goes on and moves through a variety of genres. The trick to love the movie is to enjoy this playmate. I suppose 99% of North American viewers just don't get it. If you are trying to keep the story of this movie, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc., you will waste your time. There are none of these. The movie only fails for these genres and others at times. The only force in the film is Claire Denis' own sense of what suits each other. There are so few film length films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself rather than just undergoing experience under concepts. Film usually takes the easy way out and chooses the simpler joy of understanding what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most movies do not come close to art. When a movie does as it does and is still entertaining by a large number of viewers, it is a miracle. My negative comment is that at times I find the film to simply buy into the different story threads that run through it. The Tahiti father's son's tale, though not quite conventional, ends up doing things a little to clear and simple. It dominates too much.
