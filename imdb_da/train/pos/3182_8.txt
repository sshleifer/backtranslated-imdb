Stylish and bursting British airline pilot George Taylor (a solid portrayal of Guiseppe Pambieri) is being beaten off after a wild game in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (a nice and charming performance by the lovely Chai Lee). George recovers his health and goes back to work. When Emy does not belong to George for a long time, she lives in despair and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-author Bitto Albertini really delivers a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steaming softening sex, this movie is nothing but your routine movement in learning sleaze. Instead, it is a surprisingly thought-provoking, touching and tragic love story between two well-off and highly appealing characters (Chai as Emy Wong is particularly brilliant and endearing). The picture begins bubbling and cheerfully, but the tone radically changes to a more muddy and hard mood about two-thirds of the way through. Emy's descent in vice after she mistakenly assumes that George has left her is bleak and disturbing; This is the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ends. Granted, the story is definitely melodramatic, but never too stupid or obscure. In addition, the sex scenes are tasteful and even really erotic. Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a great support as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished film gives many strikingly beautiful shots in the exotic places. Nico Fidenco's funky, throbbing score hits the groovy spot. Worth looking for those looking for something else.
