Hi now, I can't claim to have seen all the Jesse (Jesus) Franco movies, and there probably seems to be many of them, but it's one of the better (and weirder) of the party I've seen. I would say that he was in his prime back in the late 60s / early 70s, and something lately has been a little too strange for me and it requires a lot for me to declare the. It is nevertheless a great bad dream, where parts of it seem to be random at various points. This woman is an actress or something that performs in a theater in Berlin, where acts of "false" torture are performed to a commendable audience (?!), And she seems to have this problem of dreaming. The catch for what is real and what is not in this movie is apparently the real thing is in sharp focus and the dream thing is not. She seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I don't want to say this makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild and weird and entertaining. The Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and scary place so it adds to the atmosphere. The end is extremely abrupt, however, the movie ends and the tape turns black, I don't have to tell you it was over at that time. My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can't get enough of that stupid. But it's good crap.
