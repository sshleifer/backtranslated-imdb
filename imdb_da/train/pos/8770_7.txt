I thought I believe in a good way. True to life, it is not. The whole Oirish case gets a little thick, but you enjoy the role here-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All good. I also liked watching Mike Mazurki-of Course he played a boxer, what more? Typical four series flirt with familiar faces and fast scenes, one after another. <br /> <br /> Flynn is fine as Gentleman Jim, you never get past a one-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and supposed to please, that's all together. Boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville logging is like a riot, and you had to see all the billyclub wielding bobbies going into the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Real alotta fun, Flynn was on a role at the time, and it is clear to see why the audience loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
