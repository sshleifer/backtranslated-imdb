It's a fun business that goes through movies. In those days when "internalized emotions" and "emotional emancipation" are favored by easy-to-understand sentimentality, it must be difficult to be faithful to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after completing jury assignments in the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei. After the screening I saw that the people's dreamy amble out of the theater hall, watery eyes, men, women and reviewers alike. Even the director of Berlinale, apparently a hardened cinema woman, admitted that he had become rude and found himself crying three-quarters into this immense sentimental experience. But it was really surprised me that the reviews were coming after. Although the film was rude, many reviewers chose to be lukewarm and emotionally unfounded in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they had put their "thinking cap" on and consequently missed what I felt was the ingenuity of Kabei. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> Seen in pre-war Japan, Kabei's story revolves around a writer's family and their fate in it, after being held in prison for what was described as "thought crimes" against it imperial will. Through a series of long-lasting emotional scenes, Yamada acquainted us with the man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as three side signs ?? Man's beautiful young sister, a bumbling ex-student and a cad of an uncle? ? Everything will help the family cope with their situation in the absence of the house man. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, albeit at a slow pace, and heartbeats occur at exactly the moments everyone is able to predict. This, of course, makes it almost impossible for anyone in the audience to become too emotionally confused by any dramatic event. In other words, even if you learn to love the family and their helpers and sympathize with their unfortunate situation, you are so lulled by the security of the plot that you yourself expect a certain kind of end. <br /> <br /> But two hours in the movie (calm, Yamada gives the viewer enough gravity and the way of life to tive you together), he strikes you in what I can only term as the "sting". All you assumed to be, what the story was about? An innocent man turned off his faithful wife and daughters ?? now suddenly points to one of the family helpers. A person you have taken for granted so far is now thrown into an unexpected fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something curious about the theater I was in. Everyone began to sneak with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My word!" I muttered during the breath. It then struck me that "Kabei" ultimately was more than a movie about a family torn by an empire on the edge of the war. In fact, it was a cunning study of a common human foil: how little we took care of the secret feelings of people closest to us. Now, the most common criticism of the film was that it was technically solid, but lacked innovation. That's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap, I assume. With Kabei, I think Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch a unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick he used seamlessly in the Tora-san series and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> Having lied to the audience in a kind of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into a sense of emotion rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the most effective movie tool for everyone. One that avoids detection, but affects you deeply. And evidence of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown in a trash bin just outside the thousand-seat cinema hall. Now, if only some reviewers would resist being so preoccupied with being wise, they forget what the cinema really is about. Human emotions. Clean and simple.
