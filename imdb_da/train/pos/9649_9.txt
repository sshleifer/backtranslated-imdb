Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title 'Come Undone', April 25, 26., and 27. 2001. The cinematographer uses techniques that add the narrative. Even with autumn / winter backgrounds for the 'current' and spring season for the 'flashbacks', there may be problems following the continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether or not lead is gay, the actors well imagine the emerging relationship of real life from physical violence to one another to their passionate love. The story draws you into the characters a little slowly at the beginning. But when the end approaches, you're really interested in where these guys will be next summer! You also want a sequel to find out.
