Where the pavement ends is a good movie-noir crime drama and shot well in black and white and on the spot. <br /> <br /> A copper accidentally kills a blocker suspected of murdering and protecting himself, covering it up and accusing it of another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot crimes in the past. But in the end, he owns, but not until he falls in love with a woman he meets, who loves the person he killed. <br /> <br /> The play includes Dana Andrews (While City Sleeps, Demon Curse), Gene Tierney (Laura, Ghost and Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond Posidon Adventure ) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts from everyone. <br /> <br /> If the pavement ends are worth checking out, if you get the chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
