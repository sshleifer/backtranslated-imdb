I watched this movie on cable, it was really fun, from the stereotypical police chief to the stereotypical great evil, jay leno and Mr mayagi from the karate kid star in this great comedy about a prototype car part. I compare this movie with "RUSH HOUR", where a local policeman has to work with an Asian police officer to resolve a case. Chase through the farmers market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Entertaining soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
