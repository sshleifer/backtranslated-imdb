Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadget whose former films just made some artistic profits in the 60s and the hollow afaricious 80s. With "The Notorious Bettie Page" she points to an involuntary eye on the 50s America, an era struck in the moral justice by Joe McCarthy while experiencing the start of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. . Harron and her co-author Guinevere Turner are obviously not interested in the standard biopick of a sex symbol. This is a film about an elderly underground icon and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and the unclean thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life were the whole movie was concerned, why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America's attitudes to sexual images then and now. Along with a terrible leadership of Gretchen Mol and the amazing atmospheric film of W.Mott Hupfel III, she achieves this goal admirably and holds a mirror to the past while the audience examines their own "enlightened" 21st century attitudes to so-called "pornography. America suffocates during a new conservatism, this is a movie more than ever necessary.
