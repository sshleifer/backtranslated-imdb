Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How to make a comedy out of murder? It can be risky business as the viewer is obliged to let go of their moral values ​​and laugh at a man who kills people. So the story is rock solid with a good dash suspended reality to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-buying, sex-abused alcoholic who kills people to live and has a life crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start he learns he needs a friend. But Greg's happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home, and a life. Add character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the hit man's manager and we are out on the races. Brosnan is wonderfully crass and raw as antihelt and Kinnear as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a brilliance as Kinnear's very conventional wife is fascinated by this derelict who engages in their lives. The finish is lovely and with a little surprise. You should at least partially make the sense of theater good - if you are able to suspend being horrified by killing people.
