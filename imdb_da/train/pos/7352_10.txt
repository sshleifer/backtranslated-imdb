This was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and I'm now hooked! Okay so it requires the adoption of another mindset to watch American movies, but when you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is, you won't be disappointed. The songs are amazing, melodic and very captivating. The actors are visually convincing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is probably one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world. Places, color are spell binding. If you want something else and seem to be uplifted, encouraged, and stimulated, I recommend catching this movie.
