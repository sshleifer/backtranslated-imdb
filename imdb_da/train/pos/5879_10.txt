One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi movie screens. A remake of the Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of 60-year-old Hollywoon hit of the same name, raises the Garam Masala standard for Hindi movie comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, Akshay Kumar turned out to be one of the best superstars of the Hindi movie theater that can make comedy. He has combined well with the new hunk John Abraham. But John still stays in Akshay's shadows and fails to rise to the apartment. <br /> <br /> The new gals are sweet and do complete justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> A must watch comedy. Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
