I did not put very high expectations on this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a little strange sometimes, but generally I think it has an acceptable credibility. The action scenes are pretty nice, and the associated music is used to evoke a bit of patriotic feelings common to American films. It may not be the best movie ever, but it is rare for Sweden, and I hope to see more similar in the future.
