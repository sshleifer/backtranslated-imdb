The story deals with Jet Li, who has to fight his old friends. But there is a problem friends are superfighters. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great contributor. Of course, the film has the typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany, "Black Mask" is unknown.
