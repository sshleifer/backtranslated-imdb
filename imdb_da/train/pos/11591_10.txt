I have also been looking to find this movie for some time and how good it would be to find it on DVD ... I watched this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed with that. It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle. This impressed me a lot. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (not understood the reason for this). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a stone and jumped off. At that time he became an eagle and flew away with his eagle friends. As an eagle, he still had his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
