Whether it's a good movie or not, movies of this kind must be made, I think. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", an overwhelmingly immersive movie with Isabelle Huppert who is sodomized by a young American in a muddy dam in a good sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope the director will go across the border as if I felt the choices that Vincenzo Natali made were not always subtle (some of the scenes were unhappy sort of "tarte-à-la-crème" as a childish slapstick), script and movie? The color of the "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprising than the previous films of Natali.
