You will notice the stars I have given this great movie that "before you see it for the first time" is implied. I had never before heard of this movie and happened across it, just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not very big coming in). I'm not sure how this movie slipped past me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it did. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what to do if you don't have a big budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; straigh enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many turns. I would have given this movie 10/10, but some of the pictures were pretty fake. I don't mind this movie too much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she is quite undervalued as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is hard), she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And she can seem cold and even lifeless if necessary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam does really well, initially as a very grim corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. But as he changes throughout the movie, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or any other hope of becoming the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam would / could / should fit that bill. He is suave and grown. He has a good Bond attitude and voice. I also think he can also be cold if the situation requires it, and down to the ground. <br /> <br /> Great movie and absolutely this movie buffer recommends watching at least once if you like corporate espionage movies.
