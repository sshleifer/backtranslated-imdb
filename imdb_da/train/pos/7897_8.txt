At first glance, this film does not look like a particularly large one. After all a Bette Davis movie with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 must be quite bad. But the film turned out to be a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> You'd first expect this to be a normal average '30's movie with a formal love story, but the movie is surprisingly well-constructed and has an unusual and original story that also helps make this movie a very pleasant to see. <br /> <br /> The story is borne by its two main characters, which Bette Davis and George Brent play. Their helped by a cast of most fun characters, but the movie mainly involves just about the two. Their character is involved in a most unusual and wise writing love story that also seems humorous. It makes this movie a nice little comedy to see, it is quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite short (just over an hour long), meaning that history does not waste any time on redundant plot lines, developments and signs. It also makes the movie pretty quick, which helps make this movie a perfect monitor for one of today's standards. Perhaps it makes the movie a bit of a simple at times, but it never comes at the expense of entertainment or fun. A nice comfortable, simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
