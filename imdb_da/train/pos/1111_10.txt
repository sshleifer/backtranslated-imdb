It's not so bad that it's good, it's good! For those who do not understand why, you have a four-year intellect (in response to a particular comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you and a parody of you me. It is the most brilliant text in film history. I have it and the three prequels are sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It highlights the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything you or I call standard. I write scripts, and this movie opens a hand for a comedy genre to me, those we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions ... its kind of exploitative ... right now I'm just trying to go up to the ten line minimum. My comment ended some time ago. Hopefully it works when I send it now.
