The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is amazing, and it actually looks. But this movie caught me guard. It wasn't what I expected at all. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember not being able to stop laughing !!! And it wasn't just thrown that did it for me. Scripture was incredibly written. Every time you expected something to happen, it didn't happen. There were so many twists, but it fits with the whole tone of the movie rather than pretending to be pretentious. The cinematography, along with the set, was also quite beautiful. I really can't say anything bad about this movie! View, I wanted Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!
