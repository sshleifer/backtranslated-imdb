BASEketball is an extremely fun movie that delivers plays that generally make the movie much more fun, comedy material that is more than shovel in your pants fun and a pretty good plot despite being the classic slackers vs the evil rich guy. And the only thing I didn't like about BASEketball was that the baby wasn't really necessary in the movie, but if the child wasn't in the movie, some of the fun scenes wouldn't exist. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, exclude them all because all reviewers hardly liked this movie. BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
