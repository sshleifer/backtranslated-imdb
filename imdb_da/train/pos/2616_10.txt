Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of The Lion King, but with a few twists. In the film, e valves are explained with a different sign point of view. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> As far as successors are concerned, Disney is not so good at making valuable things. This one, the third part to The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the other.) In fact, has an original idea for it while still involving the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel to look for the ideal place to live. After searching extensively, they find the place of "Hakuna Matata". They then meet a little lion named Simba, and go through many things that parents today go through. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very good movie and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
