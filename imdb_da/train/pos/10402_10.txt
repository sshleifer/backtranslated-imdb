I first saw Thief as a child that makes me almost as old as Jinn, I think. As any child would be, I was fond of the film's imagination, ingenuity and energy. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and swirl of the script I had missed on the first impression. I have never had an opportunity to see it through the years to come. In addition to the script, the production exceeds the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the narrator at his very best. When you see thieves as a child, you know you've had a good time. When you see thieves as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It's as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
