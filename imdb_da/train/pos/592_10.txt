In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria in any of the primary school (1961), so I saved my bike home from school for lunch and always looked at this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the best thing on! I wanted to draw hidden pictures on my board and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the participant got the final hidden picture game. I even had the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so short. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden river. Really good memories are associated with Camouflage.
