His choice of film, the basic "objection" of production (which puts him in sets or simulacra of the films he comments) and his delivery is brilliant! But if you want Freud, be aware that you get Zizek's version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing way. The friction is that he is also quite mercurial, and then there may be more in his gusto than in the content itself. Cinematic it is a gem. Psychologically, this will make people of all beliefs (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) tear their heads, but reach the popcorn all. Zizek is a phenomenon and a pop icon for itself.
