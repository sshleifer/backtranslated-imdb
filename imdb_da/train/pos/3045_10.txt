This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is fun. The best thing is the laughter never stops. The plot is the same old old story, where the child is separated from the mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good. But this movie is about Amitabh, and that's all you remember on the other end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to town to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and manner is hilarious. Later in the film, he becomes the Angry Young Man, he is famous for, but humor remains. Memorable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. All in all, I rolled with laughter in the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its absolute best - that's it. It will easily give it a 10/10.
