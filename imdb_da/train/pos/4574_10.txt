Let me observe that I have cerebral palsy, and I went into this movie, which expects to give rewards to leading performances. I left the theater half convinced that they would throw an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, even though I didn't know it was. The performances were generally excellent, with a particular nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think it's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant - in other words, human. This movie, along with Gaby: A True Story and documentary King Gimp, are excellent exhibits of life with CP. In no way a complete portrait, but fine examples of people with disabilities. Most recommended.
