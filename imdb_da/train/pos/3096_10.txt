Six degrees had connected me. I was looking forward to moving forward and was totally disappointed when the men in trees replaced the time point. I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised it ended. We could relate to the signs that had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite people. There wasn't anyone on the show I didn't like and felt the actor was great. I always think the programs will be lost in cities where you can identify the local areas. I for one would like to protest against the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give it a good time slot, don't keep moving it from this day to the day and advertise it so people will know it's on.
