The hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's fun on its own terms and also fun unintentionally.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they too bad! One is given to pinup bags and salacious comments where e's she goes. The other one has come up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has the sensual, slightly separated lips. And in order not to give anything away, she is even worse than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbled in their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career. <br /> <br /> It looks as though the first mainstream soft-core porn is ever marketed. Well, of course not the first, but the racest at the time. The girls carry as little as possible and let's not forget the female audience members: Bromfield is shaving with an electric shaver - whose fetish was this? - bare-chested. He is also shown sopping wet in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real plot: Girls' family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can be made to act as suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really don't know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. The women are rarely dressed. They often resemble lurid covers of mags like Police Detective or jackets of dime novels. <br /> <br /> But the guy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is also supposed to. <br /> <br /> It's very fun - and also on your own terms.
