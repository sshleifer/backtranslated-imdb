First, I looked like this movie. It was well traded by everyone. <br /> <br /> I don't understand comments, I hear from people about a surprise. I didn't know anything about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot went in under ten minutes. (I will not mention what clued me in for not destroying a good movie for others.) Still, despite it apparently apparently I kept an eye out. It was great to see how everything played out, filling in the details and character motives in later stages. <br /> <br /> I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a movie. I just hate it when the road to decision is lined with dull landscape. Will Smith's screeners are as likeable even when he plays such a worried character. He is energetic and trustworthy in everything I have seen him do. Seven Pounds is another good achievement. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid performer showing a quirky, rather optimistic character despite a terminal heart disease. Beauty is in the eyes of the guards, and with Rosario, if you do not find her beautiful, you should think about replacing your eyes. It was great to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but it could just be me. Woody didn't have a huge amount of screen time, but he sold his fun, piano, blind man character for everything it was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A superficial examination of the jellyfish box tells me that its poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatocrotic. I think this makes it a questionable choice for both pets and reasons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend this movie for the plot, but for some very good performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic feelings we generally try to avoid.
