A charming, fun movie that gets a solid class around. I saw a screener of this movie recently at work. It was so nice to watch this movie as opposed to all the crazy horror movies I see every day. So much so that I figured I'd write. Not sure if this movie is going to theaters, but I hope it does. It's a nice movie to watch with friends, it's a charm, and has some fun jokes. The action was amazing (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The management was pretty good (not a movie to be overridden). What really makes this movie stand out, I think is writing. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the bias Between characters is smart and has a good rhythm. As an aspiring scriptwriter, I notice these things! (I'm a dork.) At least a really cute movie that I recommend.
