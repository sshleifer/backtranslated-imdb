For me, the last scene in which Harris responds to the press corps is worth seeing this smart and timeless piece of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real-life" pulses were to react in the intelligent, articulated way, as did Mr Harris, then the arrogant self-serving press would perhaps think twice before breaking out irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely no Something to do with graduates ability to effectively cope with the challenges of the office he / she is pursuing.
