Zombi 3 has an interesting story in it. First, it is a successor to Fulci's hit Zombi 2, where Zombi 2 itself is a marketing game to fool people into believing it was a successor to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Confusing enough? Basically, none of the films has anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I think Fulci himself is starting to care about the production about halfway through Zombi 3 when he decided to go out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help film the movie with extra scenes to extend the operating time. Zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie prize. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it trigger a plague and zombie run crazy. The scientists will create an antidote, while the military sets itself to knock down all without prejudice. There are also short posts by a Radio DJ sermon on how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie. I've heard terrible things, but I find the seedy dialogue quite enjoyable. The movie seems to be an attempt to raise awareness of pollution, destroyed military, human being plays God, etc. I get the feeling that at one point it was a serious movie, but it happened in a strange direction, presumably, as Matti come aboard . <br /> <br /> Besides tearing off other zombie flicks, this meant a lot about Romero's The Crazies. You hear Radio DJ breaking the good news with: "When you see the men in white suits and gas masks, drive to them for help." Of course, this is played to the pictures of the men in white gunning down zombies. Later, they are just stealing a scene from Crazies, where one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by a mistake. <br /> <br /> The Goref factor is pretty good in this with zombie hordes around every corner. How is it cool? Let me count the way? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie without legs swims in a pool. My favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. He was bad ass and tore almost down the whole building trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes ?? When a sergeant insists on creaming a zombie, the researchers ask, "Don't you think that when the ashes are in the air, will it fall to the ground and pollute everything?" To which Sargeant responds boldly: "Now you speak science fiction." He also continues to mention "Science Fiction", which the researchers tell even at the end when everyone dies. Extras: Gallery, trailers and interviews, especially the one with Mattei, where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, but can't remember which or other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: One must watch for zombie and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
