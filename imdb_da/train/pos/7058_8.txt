Right after I watched the movie, the true magic feeling of Walt Disney movies came to me, and I realized that it was a long time since I saw the "real" magic of a movie. <br /> <br /> The combination of the right music, speeches and magic effects brings the Disney feeling back into your body. Very special things I saw where the ignorant effects in the movie started with the Disney logo, which was transformed into the Cinderella Castle and ended as an ancient story telling fairy tales to your grandparents. The magic has returned to me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
