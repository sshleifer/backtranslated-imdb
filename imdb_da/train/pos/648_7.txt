I decided to see this because of the recommendations of this site. I must say it was worth doing. However, please note that this movie continues for 210 minutes. If you do not have the residence strength, take it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an elderly woman named Marie. Marie owns a store and she takes care of Alex. Alex spends his days at cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte, which he used to live with. Gilberte dumped him into a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and beat her. At this point, Alex was willing to get a job and help raise their child before he found out that Gilberte had interrupted it and planned to marry another. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they hit a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika are fighting for Alex's love and had a ménage to believe. Finally at the end, it is revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as mentioned with Gilbert's situation) Alexandre will even get a job and be a supplier to his new, found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Maman et la putain" I come from Jean Eustache about the character of Françoise Lebrun by Veronika. She was a whore, and then she became the mother. Therefore, is the mother and hear the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French movies are mostly (not all) very chatty, meaningless political, preaching, theatrical, unbridled, deplorable and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the movie together, as part of the script was lost and uneven. <br /> <br /> Not a bad bet. 10.7.
