Dudley Moore is amazing in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty movie that depends tremendously on the actor's talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this movie could have been a disaster. It's not always well shot, and sometimes it has some very corny music trying to force a mood (the "psycho" -like music at the wedding match), but the action overcomes it. The character Arthur is funny, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well-rounded character, as he learns to live by his own free will. However, the end is quite corny. I won't give it away, but it could be improved. Well worth seeing many times.
