I watched this movie when I was a kid - it was called "Glacier Fox". I was completely traumatized by it! It follows a cute little fox family around. The beginning was great and I remember being very attached to the little foxes. I also remember that my mother carried me out of the theater while I was in hysteria. I don't want to tell you what happened, but let's just say it doesn't end well for all the foxes. I was used to the Disney type of nature film, where the animals do not really die. Oh man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really small and the truth was told - then I remember that I love the foxes and then one of them is dying. Rent it if you can, but don't show your kids!
