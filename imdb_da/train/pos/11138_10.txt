Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is raw, painful and realistic, but very entertaining. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will be Oscar-winning players, deliver amazing performances. Voight like Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler. He doesn't apologize for his chosen profession, but it's not that easy. The New York City women as the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominee Sylvia Miles are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his previous life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer. The location in New York City is great to see, just as the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Bucks characters evolves into a moving man for crew. The men are struggling to survive in New York City by not playing the rules like getting a real job. As the film evolves, Bucks' past comes to the surface, and it's scary but not clear. The film is not for children, but in relation to today's film and TV programming, Midnight Cowboy can be more tame. I can't forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can't forget. It's also a tearjerker of a movie, so get your hankies out too.
