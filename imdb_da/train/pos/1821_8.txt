When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), this was among my favorite movies. I hadn't heard much about it since then and I don't remember anything about what it has been forgotten in the wake of Don Bluth's other, probably better movie. I managed to track it a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised again. Seen in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is lovely and the songs are memorable. There are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough, but they usually don't detract from the story that leaves you smiling (and maybe even a little foggy-eyed if you're a lover of animals). The signs are trustworthy (maybe even for adults for younger viewers). Two paws up, and for those of you who haven't seen it for a while, it's definitely worth seeing again.
