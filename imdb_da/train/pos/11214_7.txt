This was the first "Walking Tall" movie, I saw, I believe in a $ 2 movie kiosk along Hollywood Blvd. so I didn't have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by the broken system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also amazed that a man decided he wouldn't let it slip and went out to do something about it. Brave ? I thought so - to a point where it shook my backbone. I think this movie is a great story of American courage to get up and do something about a system that only serves its own interest. I was beautifully blown away about it and think it is still one of the best movies in the hero / anti-hero genre that one can laugh, but contains newer films like "The Punisher", but even more because it's true story. The recent remake with the star "Rock" does not do justice to the real fire in Buford Pusser's history. <br /> <br /> A "classic" I am sure will revive in the future.
