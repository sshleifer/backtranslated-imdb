I notice out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes included here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and certainly, not all completely finished. However, I feel a crucial point about this movie being overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The movie is set in Pensacola, Florida, and doesn't try to avoid saying it. It's a bold move in the movie world today and a rare treat for fans of indy movies. And that may not be the last. Pensacola is world famous as a naval city, an airfield, a timber town, and sometimes even a hotbed for political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing movie town. But that is changing now. Several film companies come in to shoot. And several native Pensacolians discover the cinema's power for themselves. This movie is part of a growing trend in Pensacola-based indy movies, and more are on the way. Pensacola makes a great sound in the global film community, and sometimes the world takes more attention. Look and listen, the world. The Pensacolians come. Like a virus.
