This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy voltage. No sudden surprises. If you can't stand to watch a movie about two people, just talk and go, about a story slowly evolving to the end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in dialogue, masterful storytelling, thoughtful ideas and find true love in the fabric of life, then it is your movie. I recommend watching this movie when you are most aware, because the pace, music and overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolly mood. It's really amazing. I really mean that. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes annoying with their manicures, but fortunately the affection between the two makes the action very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations, there are good comments on many topics that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too different for such young characters, but I can underestimate their intelligence. Yet it did not destroy the film. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, which I think gives the film its charm and ultimately it is power. BOTTOM LINE: The film's current is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. The story is based cautiously, systematically and in terms of content. The structure for the final is satisfactory and ultimately rewarding.
