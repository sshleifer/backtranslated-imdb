Went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea whether I was making a bad purchase or a good one. It is the later result to see the whole movie from the beginning to the end. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", 05, gave a great performance, and her look is beautiful, sexy and at the same time a real study of the art of acting really. Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave his mother. She decides to get boxing in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers. In her high school, there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys. There is plenty of action in the lady's bathroom and references to private parts of guys. If you like boxing and watch a hot sexy gal, you wonders in the ring and knock the boys on you. What is it, this is the movie for you.
