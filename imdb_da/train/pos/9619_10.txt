OK then a 10 to a 2 1/2 star movie you ask? Well see it here and maybe it will be more sensible. Hitchcock never mixed scenes together better .... The movie weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you don't get the scattered feeling you get sometimes when a movie drives you through the many characters it tries to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves, and then they won't disappoint you when they do. Screenwriter / Producer Phil Hay's Surreal Life Story, mixed with an amazing soundtrack, makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie with the same title ... I will look for more good things from this producer in the future.
