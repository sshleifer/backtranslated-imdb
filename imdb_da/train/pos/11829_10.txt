I've seen "Dick Tracy" for years, and that's why it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me through childhood, and I used to see it quite often. If it looks like an adult, it is still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. About the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received - except that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of it when it came out. Pacino is over-the-top but to good effect, as he obviously has lots of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera you can catch the atmosphere of a movie noir cartoon better than any other movie, possibly ever seen. Just watching a scene from the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, velvet overtones and smog / smoke help create a good effect. There are some really funny comos, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I don't think there are any mistakes whatsoever to act - even the mandatory kid character is far better than expected. All in all, a really good movie that has been misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly undervalued with only 5.7 / 10 averages on IMDb. The reviews of the critics are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie again it is not difficult to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a cartoon, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
