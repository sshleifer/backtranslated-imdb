This was the first regularly filmed Columbo movie episode, but it became the second, after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book". It is also at the same time among one of the better ones! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative instructor! No wonder they later asked him to lead three columbo movies. The film has some real creative and innovative spectacle sequences, and the film as a whole is also clearly made with style, passion and eye for detail. Every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better just look at any other TV movie average. It is definitely one of the better-directed Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> It is a repealed original Columbo entrance for a couple of reasons. The murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. So the killer does not have time to plan the "perfect murder" in advance and his to clean up any of the traces subsequently and to dispose of the body. The murderer of this movie is not only dealt with as the man who committed the crime but more like the man who helps Lieutenant Columbo solve the murder. It makes the sign a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps make the road Columbo solves the whole crime seems much more interesting also because of it. Of course, Columbo begins to suspect him very early, and as always, he comes to the solution by making himself vulnerable and looking stupid than he really is and by getting the killer to trust. This is of course no spoiler, as that is the way that every Columbo movie is set up. I liked the film's history and how it evolved. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film to have such a fine cast. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had really made the Columbo character his own, and the character of this was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as the short-haired Brimmer. Funny is that he would later re-star in three different Columbo films and a "Mrs. Columbo" section, only in completely different roles. He also played the killer in a couple of these movies again. He was not the only actor who did this in other later Columbo films. Also, the great Ray Milland looks in this movie, as the victim's husband. <br /> All in all, a really good early Columbo movie and among the better out of the long running series of movies. <br /> <br /> 9/10
