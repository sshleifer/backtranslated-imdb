Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) casts his epic on the Russian Revolution and hires an old former general from the tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the film's general, and the two relive the drama and memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years before. Try as I might, I feel hard to warm up to 'The Last Command' for all its virtues. 'The Docks of New York' was undoubtedly a great movie, and 'Underworld' is a movie I always long to see, but 'The Last Command' is pretty heavy. The prerequisite is fascinating, but the treatment really destroys the script, except in the sequences set in Hollywood that show the breadline of useful extras and machinations of a large film production with state-of-the-art technology. <Emil Jannings is predictably a wonderful Russian general secretary who distinguishes wonderfully between the traumatized and outdated old former general who is transfected in his misery and the strong, cordial officer of yore. <br /> <br /> The finish is great and worth the wait, but to get there, be prepared to be a little bored from time to time.
