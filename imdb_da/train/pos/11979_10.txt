I try to see it every day for the most part, and although I have seen it for the past 4 years, I have not seen any episodes. <br /> <br /> The Show is about Danny Tanner, who is a guy who makes news for sports. His wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver, and he asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an occupation of his hair. Joey, an adult child who does comedy and draws cartoons all the time to take care of her three girls, Donna Joe, they call her DJ, Stephinie, the second-oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> Everyone lives under a roof with no one to help them out. <br /> <br /> Later in the show, Jesse gets a pig wine and later married her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this starts to happen in the new seasons) This show is great if you like The Suite life of Zack and Cody, It's so Raven, Boy Meets World and Design Woman you will love this. (It starts to get better at the end of the seasons) See it, you will love it!
