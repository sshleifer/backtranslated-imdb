I just want Jedi back, been instructed by someone else, I think there are far too many ewok scenes, totally unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia is no longer struggling with Solo, Luke looks dull, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda dies right. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that I just can't hate it. <br /> <br /> Some SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-emperor (now it's evil) 4- Speeder's chase in the endorse forest. 5-last match. 6-The Dark Side Seduction Scene. 7-Anakin's return to the good side of the force. 8- And the last party. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can bring tears to their eyes. If some scenes had been cut and another director was hired, it would have been as perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it is still extraordinary. 9 out of 10
