Little rain ... what can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The movie had a great story. I loved it! Ever since I saw the movie I've been stuck in the eighties and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he picked up all his music compositions, and Apollonia sat on the stairwell with his ear in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a good job in the movie, he actually seemed like himself. I'm so glad I've seen this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautiful song, was so obvious. I cried more than once.
