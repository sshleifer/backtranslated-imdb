I was just "welcome home" my 23 year old daughter from a year in Iraq, Camp Anaconda Medical Center, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other recurring veterinarians feelings to try to better understand her mentality on arrival and not wait until after something bad happened. Whether you go to war and peace, this movie serves as a good start for all Americans to begin the healing of our recurrent veterinarian emotional void. The overall statement of the entire movie is "Take Action" on the issue. Incredibly emotional movie. I would highly recommend this movie to the veterinarian veterinarian throughout the mature family and request that they accompany a plan to listen comfort help the recurring Golf War Enduring Freedom Vets. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost a year later & My daughter watched this DVD. Took into account her feelings and has actually committed to rebuilding for another 6 years. Her take on her time in the sand is that she did something good. Local Balad children received first-class medical care for various common ailments that normally cannot afford free with an escort and translator. Her look over her shoulder on her Iraq tour was. "We've changed some hearts and minds back there" Great DVD, you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
