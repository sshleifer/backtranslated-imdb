Atlantis is probably the best Disney movie I've seen this year. It has a great action scene, magic, an intelligent and woven writing script. Atlantis, brings the magic of Disney Classics back as "The Lion King" or "Alladin". After seeing this I am sure that this year the summer blowing season will be great. I recommend to everyone that "Alantis: The Lost Empire is like an inspirational spirit. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
