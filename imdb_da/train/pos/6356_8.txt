I thought how The Grinch Chairs Christmas was a pretty good movie. It was not terrible, nor was it good, but it was fun to watch. I felt that if Jim Carrey got a little annoying at times. They made Grinch sound like a special educator, as all he needed to be was evil and rude, yet he seemed retarded. I thought nature, when it wasn't inside Grinch's cave, was beautiful, and there were a few parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been so much better if they had changed Grinch's personality, and they had included some more laughter scenes because most of the humor was not fun. I liked how Grinch stole Christmas anyway, but it's not something be excited to see.
