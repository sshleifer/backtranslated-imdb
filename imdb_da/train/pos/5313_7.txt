Since I'm not a fan of almost any post-Desperate Living John Waters movie, I was heated to "Pecker". After coming from the underground, Waters rubbish tips produced by his former works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray "), saw that the deadly fans looked and tasted like the water liqueur." Pecker ", who does not try to revive early successes, is a small, quiet and humble commentary on the loveliness of the knowledge and the pretentiousness of the art world. The water clearly knows this subject well because he also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art ever created that you could not imagine anyone could give away if it was not emblazoned with Waters "name" Edward Furlong is fine as "Pecker" and Waters' non-histrionic style is calm with the topic.
