Reviewed on the World Premiere Screening September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This had an interesting premise but seemed to go too long with too many shots of bunker eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc. shipped to China with tons and then sorted and remade in new products to sell back) and the other deserted. <br /> <br /> The movie authorities tried to get more people interviews to increase the human element, but were often prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Still it was interesting. The pieces in a high-end real estate agent in Shanghai that characterize and sprinkle with showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, interkut with scenes from others living in medieval conditions, were particularly striking. The opening track on a 480m factory floor was also something. Scenes of activity on the Three Gorges Dam project were also complementary to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and Documentary Dong feature), also built around this topic. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and Subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person who helped with access to the land in China itself.
