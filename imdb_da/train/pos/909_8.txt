I liked these movies. Its another Yash raj movie that you know will look good on the screen, all characters are always nice or very cozy with an exception that you know will eventually be hidden to be lovely ... Another rule of Yash raj's movie is that either hero or heroine; s have only one or no parent Think back on all these movies .. MPK Suman did not have mother, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and finally, rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath cry ... <br /> < The movie is also good. It's a bit slow first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it often makes you smile enough. The little child (hero's nephew) is well placed and delivers very good one lines. The actor is very beautiful, but shy that you would not get it in reality. this movie does not have massively large, happy families living in the BIG house, which I was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other movies. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There's not a strong message from this movie, but it's a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not, it will inform and possibly scare you ... All in all, a very nice movie. No big plotter or twists, but a very gentle movie, much like Bollywood classic.
