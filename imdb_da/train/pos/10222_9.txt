The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and topics in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting twist on the themes from It's a wonderful life. Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky, and the two belong to a special class of older Jewish poor in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedtime. He is reduced to seeking welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he shouts to God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if he had got someone like Henry Travers, it might have worked differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had a thing for him, he was over 100 years away from this deadly spiral and all his ties to earthly things were gone. God sent Mostel something completely different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who at least had to get some basic training for angels before he got a job. <br /> <br /> Belafonte has not accepted that he has moved from life, he is still having many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who doesn't know he's gone, hit a car right at the start of the movie. You ask questions and Mostel's questions, and you have a good conflict starting with the fact that Mostel can't believe in a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who was nominated for Best Actress in the store on Main Street a few years back. The other prominent role here is the Irish actor Milo O'Sheas playing a lovely Jewish doctor. I remember O'Sheas brogue from The Verdict, I was really surprised to see and hear him abolish the doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this community. It is brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by renowned writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to catch it when sent.
