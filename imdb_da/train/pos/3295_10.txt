Such a film of beauty that it is difficult to describe. Maybe it's the absence of redundant dialogue, or maybe it's the all-star soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch the movie over and over again. I have never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it, and few from any country compete with its perfection.
