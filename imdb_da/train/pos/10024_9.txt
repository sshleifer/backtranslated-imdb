There are so many things to do in Aro Tolbukhin. One thought part of asesino (Within the murderer's mind) that it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but really good. It is made with super 8, black and white images, 35 millimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin it's like a movie made a documentary or viceversa, as the most peculiar aspect relays to the doubts that leave you wondering, did he really ever exist? The film follows the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission, and then killed some people. An act for which he was captured and the death penalty sentenced. The movie starts because some French documentaries became interested in this character so they interviewed him before his death. Today, some more were involved and made a deeper study of the character. The one we are witnessing the movie. <br /> <br /> For most of the story, we are led by a half-slow phase to look into Aro's mind, primarily to decode why he did what he has done. never give us a sidetrack; they left judging for all of us, and even when we perhaps understand his actions, we clearly do not justify them. So the first half is based on remembering information; Later, things become the child of Aros, giving the film such an incredible new force (even hard has never been weak or boring). I don't mean - and won't ruin anything; So the only thing left to say is that if you have the chance to get the film near you, believe me, the trip is worth seeing.
