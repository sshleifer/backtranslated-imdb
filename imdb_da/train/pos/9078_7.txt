Overall, the plot was much better than I expected. The race track was a little annoying at times and tended to get in the way; However, there were probably real chuckles in this episode to make it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in trailers. Especially Spade was not presented in the best light in the previous campaigns, but his character comes across quite well in the pilot. There is enough eye-candy to please just about everyone, and all the common signs work up to the task in front of them. Now, if the authors can just live up to what they have begun.
