I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a fantastic job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is beautiful with a fantastic physique! He did a good job on delivering his lines, plus turned into George better than Fraser did. A great achievement for his first big role! This movie is full of fun scenes that every child will love. My kids have seen this movie several times since we bought the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the film, the extras on the DVD are just as fun. Two thumbs up on this one! I recommend it to everyone!
