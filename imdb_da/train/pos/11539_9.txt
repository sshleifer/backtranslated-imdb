ODD COUPLE is the classic movie version of Neil Simon's most famous game about a television news writer called Felix Unger, an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his best-of-breed friend, Oscar Madison, a sports writer and complete slob after wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does. Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney, who played Felix and Walter Matthau, who played Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly fun in the role, but so vivid that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Luckily, Matthau was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a one-of-a-kind gem of comics that consistently laughs all the way through. This compilation of Lemmon and Matthau proved to be comical gold that was re-visited in nine other films. With both of these players, it is no longer with us that this classic becomes more touching, but no less fun. Simon's play has been nicely extended to the screen with a silent prologue that chronicles a depressed Felix suicide attempt that is a winner. The support includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar's poker game comrades and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon Sisters, blind dates for Oscar and Felix. Of course it was an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. A joy from start to finish.
