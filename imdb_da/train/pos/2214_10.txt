My family goes back to New Orleans late in the 1600s in the early 1700s, and in watching the movie, I knew it was a story my grandparents never talked about, but we knew it existed . I have cousins ​​obviously black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" as whites and choose not to. It is a tough story to look at when you realize that it is your family they are talking about and that the Cane River is part of that story. It makes me cry, and it makes me kick my big grandfather's "ass" who owned these plantations and wondered in awe at how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived during the oppressive and yet aristocratic existence ... And at the same time, I hadn't come out of that story, I would probably not be the successful businesswoman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The act was both excellent and fair depending on the actor, but it was a movie that needed to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself why she writes "symbolically" about my family and I am not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
