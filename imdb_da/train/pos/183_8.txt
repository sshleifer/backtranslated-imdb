Exquisite comedy with Marian Davies (with the beloved William Haines). Young Peggy comes in Hollywood and seeks stardom. Cameo performances exhibit "all the stars in MGM's heaven" in the famous commissioner scene, as well as lots of vintage movies making details for the teacher. Pic also captures after Davies famous, viciously sarcastic impersonations of today's best stars (her Swanson is a beaut!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy" catches herself when she meets the famous star Marian Davies at tennis, shows her nose and comments: "Ohh, I don't like her!" <br /> <br /> My printing was perfect. History, direction, act an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados.
