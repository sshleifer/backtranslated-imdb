The unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the movie and they performed quite well. This film is solidly built and it keeps you going. Although I think you should be a horror fan to see this because of the scenes and the plot. There is a short sex scene with no nudity that could have been omitted, and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me who is in the movie and thinks things are damaging a good movie, but that's when it comes to the. There is a scene where Adam's character goes nuts and kills a cat, but you can't tell it right. The music is very different but very good. The unborn in my opinion is a really scary movie that is amazingly unpredictable and it is quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!
