All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it first when I was like 3. Now I am 12, and I rented it, it makes me think about things, and it brings back so many memories, they were "the days". I love the music I love when Charlie comes to heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie's voice so great. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is so original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back for those days. I love the characters. If that's how the mines come back when I'm 12 imagine how I want to feel when I'm like 19, I hope I can see this when I'm older. When I first saw it, I never knew I would really look back and feel this way, I hope it will be available to see. I'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a perfect 10. It's a great movie. It is so hard to explain the feeling when I get older, and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
