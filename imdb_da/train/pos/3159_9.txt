... and the series allows you to forget all that. I'm about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first post-college graduation job under the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70s were a really horrible time to be young - inflation competing for post-school-waking jobs with dismissal thirty-somethings, terrible music, worse clothes. The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of it and still manages to make the 70s look fun, even for those of us who are old enough to know better. It succeeds in seeing the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-honored clothing - and yet fill the show with the hope of youth and the things that make high school and school years both the best and the worst times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - have really terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not just June and Ward, although they are conventional in the decade. They represent what happened when the 60s finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Dona's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their entire lives to give their strange legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence and snobbishness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban show, but he basically represents a person who will play the cards he was dealt with, even when these cards are dealt with largely absent and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although the eight season is a bit due to Eric's lack.
