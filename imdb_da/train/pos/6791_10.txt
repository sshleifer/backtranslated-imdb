I second movement to make this a movie, it would be great !! I was also amazed at the history and character of this game. I've played it over and over (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy Eats Your Heart Out! THIS MUST BE MADE FOR A MOVIE !!!!! If anyone out there needs help to start a request for a movie, please contact me. I would like to help with that project every day. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget it's PS1 most of the time. The many side quests make it different every time you play.
