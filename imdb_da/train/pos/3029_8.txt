The novel is slightly superior and the best parts of the movie are direct translations of what Greene wrote; For example, the quiet but gloomy humor that breaks into the scene with Boyer and Lorre, or the damned child's occupation that takes over some of the plot. Where the film differs from the novel, it tends to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I don't suggest that the movie is bad in any way. It always looks that part, and the story remains in the mind as a good one. Some of the smaller characters were the actors who could turn their hand into something. It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
