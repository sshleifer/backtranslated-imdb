This movie I've been dying to see. Well it took now to decide to actually rent it. It was totally worth it. This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is fun, no matter what movie he is in. But this should be really close to being his greatest. If you are looking for a family movie, ie. Before teens and up, it's one you can't pass.
