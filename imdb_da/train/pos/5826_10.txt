I remember when I first saw it briefly, I really laughed so hard, as with many other movies I've seen, there was no sound! The curl is really amazing on the "song" opera in this one, I'm surprised he didn't consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed, this was filmed at the end of Curly's career as a Stooge, you could really tell he was changed because he had lost himself and was thinner, his voice was immersed , his face was lined with wrinkles, although he could still pull it out, he looked as if he was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he suffered many minor strokes before his great, ending his career. Will he still be able to pull it in his last! <br /> <br /> If you don't mind Curly really getting sick at this time, this is actually one of their funniest shorts. I know I didn't mind the fact that Curly really changed, because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
