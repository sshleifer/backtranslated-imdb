This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootouts, evil guys and worse guys. It's fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he's got since stealing $ 12 million from the ultimate big boss "The Skipper." It sounds cheesy. Of course it is. But boy, I have fun watching this movie. It is a whole lot better than all those directly to DVD garbage made today. If you can get over the stupid plot than you will find out that this movie has a lot of surprises in store. You can argue that the twists are predictable. But the fast pace of this movie does not allow you to think too much about them, which is a blessing, as this film is not about revealing the ultimate twist. But more about the journey to the only moment. Only the title is a little misleading and that could be why so many people hated this movie. They were expecting another movie about mobsters instead of some crooks who crossed each other.
