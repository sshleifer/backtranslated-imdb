Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a good job of not only developing the protagonists, but also the smaller characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to any low-budget movie out there. That you do not need much to create something worth looking at. There is something to like for everyone. If you've had a horrible roommate. if you've ever chosen a dork in high school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have any kind of humor, you will love this movie. This is the type of movie that will be around for a long time and end up reviving again when Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
