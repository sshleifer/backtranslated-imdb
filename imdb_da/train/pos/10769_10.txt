I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I wasn't familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very personable, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the confused girl with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as a bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a lovely vulnerable ignored housewife. Delightful ensemble cast. Lots of talent, smart script, lots going on and beautiful places. Just pick me up for a sad day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not everywhere on your horizon.
