Having looked at some of the other comments here, I have a significant complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful "victim" and the beautiful, of course, extremely "off-center" blue-collar protagonist (if only short of "completely disturbed") - vice versa to beat hell out of each other, such as a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. <br /> <br /> It's okay, and of course it's mainly a "turnaround" story. But my referenced complaint is that I believe the director was caught in his desire to show Farrah's well-known and obvious physical characteristics. Beginning with the lid being dressed in a thin garment, and with a series of scenes showing more than necessary for any dramatic effect - while being extremely pleasing to the eyes, these are derived from the poignancy of the drama. <br /> <br /> Her roommates, I'm sure, give performances as written and directed - their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and insidious rings not true - based on Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the clear sign that he is come to their premises with only the worst intentions, and that she would, without reason, have exaggerated what has happened. <br /> <br /> However, it is a movie and story that is forced so much in spite of, as due to, the director's work.
