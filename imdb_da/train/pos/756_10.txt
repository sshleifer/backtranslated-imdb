I have to say, though I despise these kind of shows, shock war, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I had seen Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass, and I think Jackass is even better at programming. History lines and interviews are interweaved to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jackass's movie the second night and couldn't believe how bad it was together, everything just put in a line of joke for joke with no relationship between anything. It must have been the fastest easiest show to edit ever shocking amateur. While drinking puke is not really my thing as far as a significant entertainment show goes, Dirty Sanchez is far out of the Jackass league.
