Guys and Dolls is a movie claw for a remake. It was made eight and eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake, with big stars now, would be successful in the box office, it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version. The infinite energy cannot be recovered and the pure joy you get when you see something like this: A great widescreen, great entertainment movie. Marlon Brando (who was last bell in 409 lbs. Last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit whose as-often-as-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it crap game is the whole city famous. But when the one place he has left to keep it charged $ 1,000, Detroit has the money fast. He asks Masterson $ 1000 that he cannot take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. Guys and Dolls are basically nothing more than outrageous types of song and dance, as usual, as it does here, add up for fun. It is obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets and the scenes were long. If I were to complain about one thing, it was so uneven the songs were. At times there were two songs in a scene; Other times, thirty minutes went without one. Guys and Dolls are never boring, just a good time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> Not rated.
