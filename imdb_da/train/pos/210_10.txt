Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on his hit game. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially when the comedians are Matthau and Burns. Little wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he is so sharp and as fun as ever. And Matthau is his own fight if it is a bit more alert. <br /> <br /> This is familiar to Simon Territory: two old vaudeville partners are reunited to a television special but still cannot stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> Seeing these two picks together, their scenes together make this movie an absolute joy. Myself, I especially enjoyed "Banks, Banks, Banks / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put some "sunshine" in your life.
