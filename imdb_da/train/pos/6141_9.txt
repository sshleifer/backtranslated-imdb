She has studied witchcraft by post and has secretly learned it in her home, it goes well until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid are sent to Angela Lansbury's big house. She is not happy to have them because of her secret. They will only go home. The oldest boy is very difficult to get along with, he is abrupt. The other two a boy and a girl are just curious about their new place to live and the lady who is their hostess. The kids find out her secret, and that's when the fun begins. Fun and more of it. Family fun. Laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are pretty good. This is a musical melody just as spectacular to sing later as any of the other Disney movies. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
