The movie as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with well-executed co-starring tournaments by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly monitored, and manuscript approval as well as all aspects of the movie, down to clothing, were closely monitored and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had anything to be proud of. His leadership of the agency from 1924 to his death was driven by the best exploration services in the world. But in 1959, Hoover already began to worry about being forced out and already started collecting dossiers on powerful people to secure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no movie even showed a single wart about the agency. The films show only continued successes and brilliance over the mistakes that occurred and the agency's part in the witch hunters from the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with your tongue stuck in your cheek.
