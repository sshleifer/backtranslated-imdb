Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good performance by both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a good job in imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy, boring clerk. For the men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks great and is very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected turns in history are good for excitement. Although I was hoping for a good ending, the last part of the movie was quite surprising to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: Huit points.
