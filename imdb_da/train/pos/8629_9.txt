I read a little ad in some horror magazines in the early 90s about Liebe des Totes (the dead love) or something similar. This of course woke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Nekromantik films are Ok, though they are interesting and unique in their approach to the subject of Necrophilia (although, of course, they are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewer's mind, they are actually quite funny.) <Br /> <br /> TODSKING, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made. It consists of a series of scenes depicting the many aspects of death. Death as an enemy Death suffering, Death as the body's very physical degradation. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the children they (we) actually are. The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death, and thus neither death, is the core message of the film. This is a most realistic movie. Never try Buttgereit to hide death behind white roses or anything. No matter what moral standards you create, death is inevitable, and sooner or later will not be a fiction but your reality. This applies to you, dear reader, as it applies to the viewers of the movie. Some juvenile reviewers do not seem to understand this, which is completely excused as they will, of course, live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploitation movie. Why? Because death does not use us humans. It reaps us. We grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauer condition before birth, that is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of stories. Whether you choose to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic", it's up to you. At first glance, it may seem very dark. However, consider that for something to live, something else must die. "Who will live forever?" I think that when Buttgereit shows a body that is consumed by stomach pains, he not only shows degradation but GENERATION of new life. Isn't it better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and finally to be ground than to remain the living dead zombie, one of the most popular pets in the genre? <br /> <br /> Once you realize this, you see There Todesking it its real context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage has the week, last few hours. Seven are the weekdays (weak, mortal!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't fear Reaper, Buttgereit tells us because Reaper only takes what is mature. And apples that are not picked for food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, fellow IMDBs! <br /> <br /> (And see this movie that only compares with Ingemar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
