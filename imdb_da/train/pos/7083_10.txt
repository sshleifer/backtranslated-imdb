A great addition to everyone's collection. 12 monkeys are a movie you don't see every day. It has excellent actors going with an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he has the role of John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors' story is not a new one, but history takes a fresh new direction on it. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that has wiped out most of the human species. <br /> <br /> Actors in this were awesome. I must mention Brad Pitt, who was funny when the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) meets in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The manager did a great job of bringing us a disturbing picture of a future destroyed by a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the virus world made them feel like they were driving the world when people are driven to underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was excellent and must see and also it is a must. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
