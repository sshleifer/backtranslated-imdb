I don't know how or why this movie has a bad rating on IMDb. This movie, accompanied by "I'm curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down in this movie is if you don't like the movie's process, not as psychology or if you expect hardcore pornographic ramming. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to see to relax; It is a movie that you would like to see as another masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES, MAY INCLUDE A SPOILER OR TO ******* <br /> The most important thing about this movie is that it mixes the whole movie, within a movie thing, but it does so in such a way that you sometimes forget that the fictions are not right. <br /> <br /> The film is like many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the social system in Sweden at that time. Which in many ways is still relevant to today. Interviews made by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A story about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, who makes a movie ... he's about a relationship with his star in the movie and how he should never have been involved with people he was supposed to work with . <br /> <br /> 3. The movie Vilgot does. It's about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2) who is young and very politically active, she makes a documentary film (IE. # 1). She is also an upcoming age and in her sexuality and freedom of it. The amazing and sheer shine of "I'm curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are cut together. For a moment you see an interview about politics, and the next thing you see what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but do it so well that sometimes you forget it's the story. Another thing is the dynamic between "Yellow" and "Blue", as if one sees one, one should see the other. "Blue" is not a successor at all. I will try to explain the best I can because I know that no other movie has done it, even though it is a good technique. Think of "yellow" as living things, current events in 14 scenes. A complete tale. <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" like all things IN BETWEEN the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you didn't see, it's a complete tale of it yourself. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the parallel movies ... are the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this was useful to people, being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way I watched movies. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
