What can I say about the first movie ever? <br /> <br /> You can't judge this because it's not going to be entertaining. But if you have to judge it, give it a 10. It's great to see moving pictures from the year 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of those people who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
