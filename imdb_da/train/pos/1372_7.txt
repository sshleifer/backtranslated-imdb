"Party Girl" capitalizes on Parker Posey's huge charm. In fact, the movie sometimes seems to be a vehicle where Mrs Posey allows herself to play herself as she usually is. The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Mrs Posey's fans. Mrs Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip to lower Manhattan to show us this speechless soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the various clubs she always finds out. This is an era that was still more naive than what this area and the adjacent meat market quarters became. At least there are no pretensions in the movies and we look at the ground people are going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that way. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes a wonderful Mary. It's because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the casting is good.
