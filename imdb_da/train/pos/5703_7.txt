I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s movie noir themes that I like to watch, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Generally, the essential stupidity of the film noir main character is not well-liked by the women's lead, and her hero is almost a neanderthal, therefore kitch the warning.
