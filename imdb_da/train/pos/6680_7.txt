This was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, though a bunch of actors almost shared the spotlight in this farce of superhero wannabees. The most monstrous was played by Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee Herman" fame. <br /> <br /> There is lots of humor, crystal clear colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining, lightweight comedy with nothing but stupid characters, all of whom will be heroes and leave Superman, Batman, Spiderman you called. They have talents in strange areas, though the real heroes are not (and will not!). It's silly, but you know that too. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie you can see in installments and not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for such a hectic, so take a break here and that's okay. The language was pretty good so the kids could enjoy it too. In fact, I can't remember any gang in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept saying, "What a stupid, suspicious movie." I thought it was fun two hours, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
