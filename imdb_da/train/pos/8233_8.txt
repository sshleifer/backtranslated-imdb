Fido is a story of more matured zombies who have been trained to serve humanity. Everyone falls apart, but when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family child. From then on, disaster happens (well, perhaps not disaster, but to some extent chaos). Most people treat their zombies with justice, and such a character sleeps with his zombie (very fun part of the movie, if not also very disturbing). And we find the loving Fido whatever he does. This is a very fun and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie films (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something fun and different. I rate this 8/10. Classified R for zombie related violence
