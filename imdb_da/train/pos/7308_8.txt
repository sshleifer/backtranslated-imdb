With a simplified story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings the life of a nail-biting nightmare on the Halloween night when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, career-defining role) and her scary friends are planning a night of lukewarm fun - just crossing paths with a hellish psychopath from hell. Michael Myers fled from a nearby insane asylum ... after slaughtering his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy Illinois city where his murder took place. When he puts his eyes on Laurie after she has turned off a parcel to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to steal and terrorize her and turn his funny night into him when he chooses someone on the way to come to her. br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flickering scary ... with the long gloomy shots, it always feels like you're being stalked by the manic serial killer. Myers are hidden well until it is fully revealed by the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. The idea alone is a goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made for today ... it created seven sequels and finally Rob Zombies just as scary remake and it set one new standard for horror that still exists today.
