One of my favorite movies. It has everything - rocking soundtrack, with Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughs, absolutely ridiculous plot and the most wonderful 80's stereotypes as characters. Eddie, the beautiful guy who just wants to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (rock burnout), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (nerd) and Ozzy as preacher (surely he exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, evil and stupid) and the girls (unemployed, in vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? Well, first of all, there is Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every 80's badass rocker you can think of. What about the rocket burner guitar? Then there is the scene where Sammi pulls the old lady through the TV screen and smashes her up. And what does Roger do? Why hover her up, just like a good geek would. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his long delayed reward from Sammi via the wet finger in plug-magic! <br /> <br /> If you were in rock in the 80s or just love ridiculous movies like I do, check out this one. It is available on DVD and very cheap so (trick or) pamper yourself.
