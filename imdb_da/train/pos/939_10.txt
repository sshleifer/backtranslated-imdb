Okay, there are lots of reviews here, what can I possibly add? <br /> <br /> I still want to try. <br /> <br /> The reason why this is my favorite Scrooge is because of Alt. The sets, outdoor spaces, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is cute. The support molding is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew played by Roger Rees. His underestimated sincerity touches and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also a completely credible Bob Cratchit. His is a hard life, but he remains positive and worthy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best part is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his portrayal is for gruff. I couldn't disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning, while they were cold or hard, were not of a character. He is a terribly disillusioned man whose heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> During feedback, it is obvious that he is not all gruff. This is where we see hope for him. If he were completely gone, his partner Marley would never have come for his sake at first. And after all, we are neither of us previously hoped. I think that is a big part of what Dickens tried to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance with his employer with Belle, he sees him smiling as he tells Belle in the feedback that he will go through life "with a smile on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough as director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they come to the left on the editing floor. <br /> <br /> Finally, his transformation is so full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy. Every time I see it. His excuse for his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only Christmas but humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred's wife is so clear. And the line that gets me every time, "God forgive me for the time I have wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
