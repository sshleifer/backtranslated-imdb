This movie moves without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious. It tells a simple story of a family at risk of falling apart, as technological interventions and a forward-looking society make family-run businesses more and more unsustainable. The action is wonderful - although none of us in the West will probably have heard of these actors we should have long ago - they play their characters with honesty and reverence - these are incomplete characters, each with great weaknesses but with such completeness humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to get involved in history. <br /> <br /> We need more movies like this - we need more Western movie makers to create movies like this.
