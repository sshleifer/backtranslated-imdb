I saw this in July and even with the Christmas theme found it touching and sensitive. It is not for anyone with a sense of reality, as it is filled with imagination and wonderful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I've only seen him in remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes always looked at what Hank considered the things that happened to him was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very trustworthy in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was fantastic and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one in which Hank realizes who Max really was in his life. It's not for everyone ..... especially those who are not in the 'feel-good' movie, and that is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and sensible, avoid this. But I think it's worth reconsidering why I lost it. (Yes, some of us still have video recorders. :)
