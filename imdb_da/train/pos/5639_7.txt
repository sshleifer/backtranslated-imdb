I have read the other reviews and found some to compare movies to reality (eg what is required to enter the music school), Britney Bashing, etc. So let's focus on the movie and the message. <Br /> <br /> I rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age group 8 to 14 years and for a family movie. For the average adult man .... 2 out of 10. I like pop / rock music, I'm 45. I know Britney Spears, but never understood she actually sang stronger until I read credits and these reviews. I didn't recognize his poster on the wall, so I wasn't worried about any 'self-promotion'. <br /> <br /> I see movies to be entertained. I don't care about casting, lighting, manufacturers, directors, etc. What is the movie and entertaining me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The world's largest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a completely different story), so one then with the message in mind, as it is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. I found the Texan twang began to fade throughout the film and of course there are only so many ways to convey give up / not give up message, so yeh, it was a little predictable. Great message though ... should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a look, he sees alone, gets Hannibal.
