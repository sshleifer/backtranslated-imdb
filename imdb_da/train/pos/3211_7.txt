This movie is ok if you like mindless action, corny acting and a very small plot! The special effects are decent considering that this movie is from the director of the "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something from a crazy max movie. None of the soldiers speak, so others tell them what to do. It ends up being like a big shoot'em up movie with explosions throughout the place. I personally liked Russell better in "tango and cash" "escape from la / new york" and "executive decision". It must see this movie leave yourself at the door of a no brain action science fiction movie !!
