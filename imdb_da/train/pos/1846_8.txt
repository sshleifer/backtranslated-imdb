When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it should be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories signs seem more real and you empathize with the situations more. The concept of drama is the same, four 30 some women lead us through friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way. Katie GP is a dark and brooding character that you find difficult to relate to and is best friends with Trudi widow. Trudi's character is heart warming, as you can relate to difficulties she has with her being the only mother of the four. Jessica is the party girl very single-minded and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a sympathetic character and is closest to Siobhan the newlyweds who, while loving her husband, cannot help their eyes walk to her workmate. Across the drama is surprisingly addictive, and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it can do well. It is in contrast to other female cast dramas such as Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. This if it is played properly can be the next cold feet. Plus the male cast is also not bad on the eyes.
