Along with "Aparadektoi, the best Greek comedy series ever!" Writes Lefteris Papapetrou, and Antonis Aggelopoulos leader in a magnificent way Soso, Alekos, Flora, Achilleas, Grandfather Aristides, Machi, Johnnie, Corrina and Michalis! In a few words, Alekos, a butcher who lives in a neighborhood around Athens, is married to Soso. One day he meets Flora, an old date for his, who is now married to Achilleas and lives with his father-in-law and his caretaker, Machi. also has a son named Johnny who appears at the end of the first period and the whole second. The other protagonists are Michalis, Alekos assistant in the butcher's and beekeepers, and Corrina, Achillea's lost sister, who has become the best prostitute in all of Athens. The main series of the series is Soso's attempt to kill Alekos because he cheats with her, but anything else that happens in it is not of minor importance. Brilliant manuscript with an excellent plot, poisonous quotes, aw esome performances and a good director. The original idea and especially the shootings were something that was done on the Greek television, for a series of Greek TV for the first time, eg. scenes shot under water! Surely a serial you will never stop enjoying!
