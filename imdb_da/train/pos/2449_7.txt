when i saw advertisements for this i thought "NO WHAT HAS NOW DONE NOT DONE!" because it was to record "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love the fresh prince. But George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how non-stereotypical benny is. carmen is a beautiful good character, it is really fun to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes. I feel bad for the guy who plays max, he looks much younger so he actually is! but max is a fun character and acted well. And yes, Angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george have a big head! nah but he can also be really good. fun show! It should definitely be more often than home improvement.
