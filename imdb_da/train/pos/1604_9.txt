I'm really surprised that this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB. It is one of the movies that could easily come from anyone, but for romantic comedy "Moonstruck" there really is a class in itself. It's setting and ethnic charm is the thing people seem to take for granted. Casting alone makes it an almost perfect film. Few movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's fun too. **** out of *****
