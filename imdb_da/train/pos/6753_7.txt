Otto Preminger's noir classic works almost like a flip side of LAURA ... while that movie was beautiful and has the high-gradient Clifton Web, this movie is very seamier. Dana Andrews is a less than good policeman, who accidentally kills a man only to have it possibly attached to the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving with a powerful clip, so it goes easy in the overview that goes out of the logic. Andrews is pretty nice (much less wood than he has been in the past) and the amazingly beautiful Gene Tierney is amazingly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. WHERE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a fantastic companion to Preminger is equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also with the lead role of Tierney).
