The unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortion. Brooke Adam's stars like Virginia. Her and her squares of a man go to a fancy fertilization clinic because they cannot have children alone. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling has had a very high success rate for getting pregnant. (Insert joke here.) Is it because he creates some genetic killer supermutant babies? That's what Virginia is beginning to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme temperament from the treatment. That's when she starts to take matters into her hands. On this one you need to get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I told you all the goodies that this had, you could hurt yourself putting it on your Netflix rental queue too fast. It's a bit slow for a while, but when it comes to the last third, all systems go! Highly recommended by me on the strength of his un-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
