No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances to date. Mencia is known for poker and making fun of racial issues. But he does more than that in this stand-up performance that took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh, but it also allows you to think about what's really wrong with society today. In this hour-long performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion on Mel Gibson's passion for Christ and an argument that he came in with a woman as to whether He is influenced by Jesus and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether to have the right to speak and tell a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, many of whom have problems with his critics. For example, he goes a long way (and he admits) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he most likely does in heaven right now. <br /> <br /> The main message of Mencia in all his beliefs is that we all have a voice and that we must use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression and that we must use that right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend seeing the Mind of Mencia, his show at Comedy Central.
