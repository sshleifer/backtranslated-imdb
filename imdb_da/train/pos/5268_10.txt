The barbarians may not be the best movie any of us have seen, but really ???? ........ It's so much fun ...... I can't discuss how much I laughed when I first saw it .. The director would really make a serious adventure movie, but it's scary bad ... so bad that it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see it ..... and if you alredy did it, watch it again !! !!!!!
