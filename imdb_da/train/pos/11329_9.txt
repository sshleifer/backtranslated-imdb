The combination of the amazing black and white photography and 'Eugene Onegin with a twist' plot made this a real knock out for me. The atmosphere created by the almost very dark shots as opposed to occasionally very light overexposed white was gripping. There was a tremendous moment when transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps, but where the actors' faces revealed subtle but immediate instances - were accompanied by Lensky's heartbreaking aria from Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, the nature of a good movie is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by this medium, which means that history is often less important than image and atmosphere. Last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film. Krisana is in the same mold.
