I gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute, really fun, while it was unpretentious. I went to watch this movie when it played in the Philly area, and it was the center of a good night with friends. The film is well-written and well-acted, and even though it feels a bit like a sitcom rather than a movie, it doesn't take away from the movie. You just find comedies like this one where you don't have to shock people to be fun. The film centers around a Ukrainian housekeeper who finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. Although she initially helps, she soon adds more madness to their lives when the couple negotiates. Things get longer and more out of control until .... you'll have to watch! Banter made me laugh even after leaving the theater. This movie just puts me in a good mood. I can't wait until it's released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
