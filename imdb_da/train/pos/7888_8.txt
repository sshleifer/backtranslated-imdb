Freddy Krueger's dream stalker from elm street returns, the great character actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5, dream child. I hope I got the number correctly. There have been so many, and this is one of the best, Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who made the very first nightmare in 84) Alice Cooper (Singer), you'll see Freddy as a bother child, a teenager who loves pain and as a family guy (creepy) the effects are very fun and creative, cast also contains Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Breckin Meyer (road trip) Yaphet Kotto (alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (Dad knows best) I was one of those people 3who saw this in 3d, yes the end. I love 3d movies. I missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (I wasn't even born yet) the second wave was in 1983. I like all the Freddy movies. this one stands out as one of the better ones who does not count the first, who was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster from the 80s and 90s with jason voorhees, chucky, micheal myers and leather face.can you Imagine a movie with them all? I recommend it to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike. that Freddy is such a cut up.8 out of 10.
