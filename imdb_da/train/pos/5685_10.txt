Kudos to director and tossed to such a realistic movie. Grinetiness, lack of glamor and desperation pulled me into the movie and held me there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were relayed in the movie; i.e. newspapers, letters, etc. It kept the film's movement at such a fast pace that I didn't want to fast forward. Personally, I thought all the principles did a tremendous job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me cry at times. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his ideas of this kind usually leave me in awe. Overall, this is a brilliant movie that must not be missed!
