Very good western.This was the first time writer Richard Wilson directed a movie, also this was a first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a salon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to this city dominated by prohibited and employed as a tamer, but people are worried that he will go too far, also about the damage he will do to the city's businesses. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock", which was made in 1959. This film keeps a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
