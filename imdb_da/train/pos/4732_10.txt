I am not a big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video store was almost empty, and Jet Li was in deadly weapon 4, and I got it for free when the other movies I had rented were neither I rented it. I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting candidates) spent half an hour after the movie made strange Kung Fu sounds and casts the bearded shurik on each other. I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I've never had Bruce Lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, hitting him, kicking bigger blocks etc movie ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
