What a fantastic fun and original show. The cast starting with the hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who always wars with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN) I've cut harder during this show than anybody I've ever seen (including Newhart one of my most popular favorite shows) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series !! One of the best moments in the show is Cindy Williams, who plays herself. Tammy on the dry cleanser, finds Tammy a picture of Cindy Williams in her jacket, the picture is by Cindy Williams, who makes an unmentionable action with a bowling pin upside down, and it's great to see an actress like Cindy Williams playing herself here. opera just like many surprises, I can only hope that this will be released on DVD with special many special bonuses, the finest series I've ever seen !!!!
