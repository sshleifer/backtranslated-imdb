I love the way that this game can make you jump literally out of your seat while you play it. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you get hit, it's very realistic, while at the same time remembering it's just a game and you're not really there. The sound effects and sound are amazing. There are many weapons and different spells to throw and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. You get this stone that can knock enemies while you restore mana to blast your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that all the time you play it, you are really jumping and scared of what might lurk around in the next corner or what can jump out behind you. If you want the full experience, try playing it with headphones on.
