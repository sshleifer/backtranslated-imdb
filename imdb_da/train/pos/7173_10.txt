I just watched the documentary film "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. It is undoubtedly one of my most fun experiences ever! It chronicles the San Francisco Bay area artists and creative talent responsible for some of the best movies ever made. In addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment of Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - this is a must for any movie story collection and brilliant movie production. If you are very interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
