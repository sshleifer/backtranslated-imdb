I first saw this movie when it originally came out. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie both very entertaining and very scary and unlike any other movie i had seen until that time. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet Altair, a major mainsequence star in constellation Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers who landed twenty years before and had not been heard from the side. THEME: A poorer civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remnants of a highly advanced foreign civilization, removing Krell-200,000 years. "Seeds of employment" from one civilization are transferred to another, unconsciously at first. The theme of this movie is very good vs. Evil. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. I was just a boy, and the tiger scenes really scared me, as did the battle scenes with the unseen creativity. I was also amazed at how real things looked in the movie. What really catches my attention as an adult, but is the truth in the movie "Prohibited Knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we do it (if ever) get in touch with an advanced civilization much more developed than we are at the moment. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves to acquire knowledge along with wisdom on how to use advanced technology. This, in my opinion, is the movie's great morality. <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that "knowledge is power" at best is actually not correct! Knowledge is "potential" power depending on how it is used (... if it is used at all.) [It is not what you know, but how to use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The overall impact of This film may well be realized sometime in the future of humanity. It's knowledge in itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to really control our own destiny OR we will end up as Krell in the movie - just flashed out. Many thanks to those who responded to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all greatly appreciated !! I hope you are so entertained by this story as much as I have been in the last 40+ years .... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out 10 stars
