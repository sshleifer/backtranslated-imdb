I love the recent episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the story of Kate who fell for the main. I would like to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family next. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's a credit to his play that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believe in him as Kate's father. This family is so genuine and fun. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as things really do, and the way it was written in the series and treated, was both fun and sad and was always extremely sensitive and lovingly handled. But generally a very fun show with lots of laughs and fun.
