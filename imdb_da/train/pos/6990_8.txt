Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget coolers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones. Bela plays a crazy scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so that he can keep his aging wife looking young. After a journalist and a doctor have stayed at home and discover that he is responsible for the deaths of the brides, they report the following murders to the police in the morning and the evil scientist is shot and died shortly afterwards. <br /> <You have almost everything in this movie: Scientists' assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and creepy passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find that they sleep better in coffins than in the movie. Corpse Vanishes is worth a visit, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
