What a great movie! It was very scary, great play, well-written, good plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans but is still (one of the best thrillers out there today! I highly recommend it to ONLY fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) Horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress highlighted it. <br /> <br /> *** out of **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with SCREAM. You know what they didn't want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I don't fail, SCREAM has also copied other movies! In fact, almost every horror movie copied earlier. However, SCREAM was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> GO AND HYD THIS! <br /> <br />
