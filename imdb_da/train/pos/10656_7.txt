What a fantastic Barbara Stanwyck movie that I happened to see the second night. "Jeopardy" was amazing. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who along with husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The man has a fall from the jetty, and the only way he should be saved is if Barbara returns to a garage for a pair of ropes. <br /> <br /> As she enters a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything to get Meeker to come back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was so exciting and such a surprise - I don't expect such a big movie. But I suppose I should have realized - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does, is it less than wonderful?
