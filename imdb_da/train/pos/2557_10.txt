I myself am a child of the heart, which means I love to see cartoons, still do! I remember seeing Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was my favorite, still. I thought man, this was a great "new" show on TV, and than my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember seeing him when I was younger" and I'm like, "Dad, there was no mistake when you were younger ". So I think he's absolutely happy for more than one generation, possibly 3. I love the show, it's good for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very fun, my husband and I, both in our 20s, love to watch the show and we don't mind driving again. This show brings back many memories, happy. I also love Christmas especially with Tweety as Little Tim, it's sweet. I can't choose my favorite Looney Toon character because they have changed over the years. When I was little it was Bugs of course and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I've always loved him. In fact, I must say that is my favorite. I give this show a 10 out of 10 because it's a good show for all ages, very fun, voting is unbelievable, the only mistake is that unfortunately it was up, 2 decades ago, but the resumes are good!
