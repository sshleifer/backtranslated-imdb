Dragon Hunters must be the most beautiful animated movie I've ever seen. It was downhill. The movie is about a couple of rogues in search of some money, their weird furry blue dog who burns fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent on the quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the gobbler of the world, impossible huge dragon. But honestly it's not even something the movie is about. Because it's jaw-droppingly beautiful. The gravity of this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and ground surfaces float between the cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are forests of floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a kind of subdued history book looking at it. The world looks like a set of beautiful paintings. The monsters are also visually astonishing, like a fire suit consisting of a swarm of evil red bats. Some of the plot is not too original, just like the main protagonists who want their farm are a laughter of mice and men and never seem to be able to do so in the world; But the beautiful graphics, some seriously scary scenes and dialogue with emotional dialogues make this movie spectacular.
