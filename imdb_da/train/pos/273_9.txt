It's hard for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Despite, yes, it was predictable. I think maybe if Jill HAD slept with Richard, it might have made him a little more crazy than he already was, which would have added more to the excitement. It would also have been great to see Jill and her husband figure out Richard's little problem with his former wife, perhaps a little more backward story. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I would have liked to see more closure with Zack's death and possibly closing with his husband. However, I must say I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not see her there. It was a very appropriate end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to her future projects.
