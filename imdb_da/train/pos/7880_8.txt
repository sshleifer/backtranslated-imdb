The plot of this cozy MGM musical is constructed and only occasionally entertaining, dealing with espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is properly pointed to the melodious intervals that showcase the hugely talented and athletic tapestry Eleanor Powell, anchored by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares top billing with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr get most of the comic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, seems like Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien actually giving it most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion. The technical brilliance of Powell has been demonstrated in an incredible scene where Buddy Rich contributes with his drum skills and needs to be seen several times to allow one's breath to retrieve its precision. Director Edward Buzzell takes advantage of his large cast well to move the action nicely despite the rather heterogeneous manuscript that he has to deal with, and allows Powell's co-key inability to control the affair, as appropriate.
