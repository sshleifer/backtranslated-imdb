Kudos to Cesar Montano to revive Cebuano movies! Panaghoy said Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance and scene that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> While history is not the original (a love triangle - or make a four-cornered love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as master), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses the original language - bisaya for Filipino, Nipongo to Japanese and English to American. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy movies of the year. <br /> <br /> Look here!
