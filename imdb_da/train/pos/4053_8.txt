I remember liked this more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind at an age, as the tone history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected his release in the United States to avoid confusion with his broad Spanish audience, has the comic-like ability of the director's debut production, Conan. In fact, Pazu has the heavy bones and immortal vitality of Conan - which ran out of a thousand stories that bore his girl in her arms and landed on his feet and then began to run. This makes him the most animated and pleasant sign to see. Nausica's techie fans can be disappointed with the flying bugs and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception is the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme of Laputa is not directly related to the environment. If it has a theme at all, it is anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally - this is related to the flying castle, is debatably briefly discussed and not really followed through. All in all, I now regard the play as being at the cross between feel-good and corny.
