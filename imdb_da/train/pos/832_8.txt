Interestingly, how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is compared to the original James Bond novels compared to the bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to start. This is the perfect break for him, even as much as making fun of the bond icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. It doesn't get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No, and that's how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond. Personally, I've never seen Brosnan as Bond because he fits the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan playing a sign that is both grounded in reality and flamboyantly by the wall. A low character trying to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological problems that he has no background for. It's an impressive portrayal, and having Greg Kinear to earth him is just poetic. This movie reminds me of a bit of dynamism between the protagonists of "My Blue Sky", but more real in their handling mechanisms.
