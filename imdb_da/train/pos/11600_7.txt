William Hurt may not be an American matinee idol anymore, but he still has good taste in B-film projects. Here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste cleaning with a tragic past that traces a perennial loser on the run - played by formerly beautiful boy Weller - who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. Current beautiful boy Hardy Kruger Jr - possibly more beautiful than his father - is highlighted as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrible sequence at a chemical production plant that makes history move. Natasha McElhone is a little crazy government agent looking at the incident that gives inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest to hero Hurt. Michael Brandon shows up to play a slimy, non-captive type whose creature you can't wait for. The Coca-Cola company wins the product placement price for 2000, when the soft drink is highlighted throughout the production, lovingly shot on the spot in a winter landscape map Hungary.
