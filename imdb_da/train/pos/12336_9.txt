An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her former naive wallflower type, in a role that allegedly Olivia DeHavilland knocked down. That's fine because Fontaine is wonderful. Scripted by Charles Bennett, who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and later also wrote the excellent script for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a spooky fortune played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (James Whale fame) is a tour de force, and the film maintains interest through the many creepy machinations. I hope to watch this movie on DVD one day, but despair of it ever happens because it seems to be an undeserved obscure movie. Luckily, I saw it on AMC some seven or eight years ago, but haven't seen it since. Catch it if you can!
