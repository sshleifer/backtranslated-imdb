Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar nominated card from 1944, which is basically 10 minutes improvisational jazz game in a long paper jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at a time of the film's highlight so jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most entertaining "jam session" to its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer, and the experience shows in some of the double exposure images of some of the musicians making this one of the most innovative angles of the 40s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in the silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time. What a shame. Nevertheless, this most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you search it out there.
