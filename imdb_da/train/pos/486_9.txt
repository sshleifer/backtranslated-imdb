'Luzhin Defense' is a movie worthy of some time. It's a burning, intense movie and kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is quite astonishing in his depiction of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is spellbound as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is evident from the moment their characters meet in history. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth look at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the movie. Most people come out of theatrical thinking and feel a little touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely love stories.
