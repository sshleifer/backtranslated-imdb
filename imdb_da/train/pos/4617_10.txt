I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena and after I heard about seven minutes in the sky I saw it as soon as I could. The movie is not just a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as children and go through. Not only was the movie terrific of the phenomenal Jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was superbly written and acted out, it was a good deal I loved and seen it over and over again and for those of you who enjoys a good laugh or loves jennifer connelly that you can't turn off watching this movie !!!
