Deathtrap runs as a game in a movie about who did what to whom it primarily takes on a set. The premise is that a talented playwright whose star falls, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student, and he plans to extinguish his protege and direct his play to his high protests. Or you think for the first half of the movie. Past the halfway mark, Deathtrap begins throwing into twists and surprises that set its premise on its head, so just around, and then in an angry spin, the title always keeps fit. It is an excellent mystery film soaked in white. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine plays as the senior drama in this movie - a little loony and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - he does his usual good work. He gets the best line of Deathtrap, which he performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being the band in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> By contrast, Christopher Reeve juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong priest playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also gets to show his very toned body that he must have kept coming from the Superman films. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It is also about a game, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are with comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the accidents that affect the bed's hopping and herding of a body. On the surface, the film looks to be the most slapstick, but when you see that you find out that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one view to capture. Wanted this underrated movie was available on DVD.
