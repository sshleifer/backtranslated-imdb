I got the movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I expected it a lot when it arrived. My worst fear was that it would plodding, as well ... well, do you know what all the screaming fan girls were talking about? GACKTYHOW = hawt yaoi love? That kind of things? Dreading it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The movie was surprisingly clear, though film and music made it a show that someone had to bust out a few nun-chucks every single scene, and the actor on Gackt's side was quite good. Hyde, um, was Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend membership, that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised. He is one of my two great beef with the film itself. But the rest of the throw (including the children actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did - which was mostly shot at and shouted at. But my second problem was much less to have to do with goriness. It seemed far too frightening to me - just like any scene where someone's shot, they either hit down, really deeply honest, or lay there, burbling for quite some time. But Sho just ... takes the shots, repeatedly, club over, bubbles a lot while he talks, and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-movie fan, it's definitely worth watching.
