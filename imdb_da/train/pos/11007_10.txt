Jeremy Northam's characterization of the descending, mildly calculated Morgan Sullivan and seeing him lose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spear of Lucy Liu's presence is excellently crafted and a joy to behold. His offer of a cigarette in the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking, and he is lost in the face, neck and lips. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way to endure. Nor can love "brainwashed" with any of his two false wives. In the gradual phases, he begins to dispense with his glasses, to walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriate driving at times. The extensive use of black and white and grayscale makes this almost a sci-fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to see more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's depiction when she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves, and for whom she performs a mission based on blind faith, some limited vulnerability, and the blink of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less dimensional achievement on her side. She's just no match for Northam's talents, but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wanted to know about other screenshots written by the same author.
