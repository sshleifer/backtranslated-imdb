I have copies of both these films, the classic in which Robert Blake is a mighty fine actor, with the majority of 1967 films Blake appearing more at a window in prison telling his childhood life where it does why he killing Clutter Family did not show much in the classic of what really happened and did not tell us which one really made the killing, but it is a great eye-catching, really if you watch the movie 1996 In cold blood, the classic gives much more meaning.
