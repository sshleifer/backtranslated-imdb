My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this movie a lot. The viewer is swept away from modern life to ancient Japan, while being exposed to very topical themes. The characters are realistic and detailed; It has an unpredictable ending and history which is very refreshing. The story consists of mini-plots within several geisha's lives that live together in a poor urban area. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic romance or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
