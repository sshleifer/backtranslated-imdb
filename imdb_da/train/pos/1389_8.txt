The Williams family lives on a ranch located in the middle of the distant desert. They are in considerable danger when the place is suddenly run in a vortex, where past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on a convincing mysterious note and gradually allows things to become alien, more fragile and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with lots of dazzling images and does a good job of creating a true sense of awe and wonder. The admirable appearance of a legcast qualifies as another big plus: Jim Davis as a cordial patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheery wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the worried Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as a cute little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Cold as gutsy Steve. The funky special effects provide an inspired combination of gnarly miniatures, nice stop-motion animation monsters (the aforementioned creatures include a small spider hairless guy, a large, lumpy fanged beast and a scrawny four-legged guy) and nifty math paintings. Richard Band's enchanting full-bore orchestra score really hits the stirring place. John Arthur Morrill's sharp, sunny film picture does the same. A fun flick.
