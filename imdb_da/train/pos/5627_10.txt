This step actually made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors should do! The action was the best Farrah should have received an Oscar for this, she was amazing. James Russo was so good, I hated him, he was the villain and played it wonderfully. There aren't many movies that have nailed me like this. The cast was amazing Alfie looks shocked at the big eyes Farrah looks like a victim, and you lived horrified again when she went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and felt the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him, but you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. The movie had you on a roller coaster and you went up and down with each scene.
