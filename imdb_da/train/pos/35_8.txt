When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the horrible Red Queen figure, I felt confident that I was in for a big disappointment, but surprise surprised I loved it. Of course, weathered nonsense and unforgiving that such complicated degradation should be rushed to the point where it is hardly possible to read the subtitles, let alone take the ridiculous explanation. These quibbles are apart, but the movie is a dream come true. Fabulous ladies in fabulous clothes in wonderful settings and all the time constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He must not be Morricone, but in these lighter pieces he may as well be it. Really fun with lots of color, lots of sexiness, some gory kills and minimal political interference. Super.
