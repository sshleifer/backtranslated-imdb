Everyone we meet affects our thinking, changes our ways, a little bit of that person rubs on us. "The eighth day" takes up this theme (Compare "Rainmaker"). In this movie, Harry (Daniel Auteuil) meets a businessman expert in sales psychology Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a Down syndrome child on the run. Winning performances from both of these actors gives this film its greatest strength. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges relates his theory of the creation of the world and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely unrestrained, requires a few expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It is the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Downs Syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escapes on a bus and street crash Paradise fun park. The most humorous of all embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a horse-drawn carriage on the highway, and Georges gives back to the driver a rude greeting. But there are also some gentle scenes, especially the impressive use of close-ups of hands - hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands reaching, the hands reaching out and sticking in love and friendship. This is a true cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges suggests Nathalie, where Georges rocks Harry's head in his arms, where Georges stops his dear mother, where George teaches Harry to laugh. I felt there was a deep message in the movie that life is beautiful - the very presence of the grass (did you know it cries when you cut it?), The trees over, the bird's song, the little insects - all the miraculous creatures of nature. They are all there to be enjoyed if we, but back (like Harry and Georges) look around us and listen ...... A beautiful movie.
