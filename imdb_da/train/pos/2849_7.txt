I can't say this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before I saw it, and it didn't do as well as I thought it would. The bar wasn't set so high so the fact that my expectations were met doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The Good: New York City. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city should be more than just a setting, rather one of the main characters. There are really sore moments, humorous conversations and plot phrases left and right, all of which keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them have more" fashion. Obviously, the good sketches / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are many sketches that fall within the "between" category, for many in reality, which ultimately brings down the movie. Also, the diversity of New York City, though pointed out about the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the film, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of making the city's justice. For example, many of the sketches involve doing medieval whites well. I think I know the city is home to many of the demographic mentioned, but come on, Paris Je'times plot and character diversity make New York City Lancaster, PA or a place that is really white. It's just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its legacy such. <br /> <br /> Still, even after saying this, I'd recommend giving New York, I love you a show. Who knows, maybe you disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't. You will never know until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from watching this movie as everyone's opinion on art differs from one another. I just give you a very vague look for what to expect.
