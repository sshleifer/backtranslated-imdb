This is a better than average silent movie, and it's still worth seeing if you're a fan of the silents. But if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other movies before you see this. This is because the plot just seems quite old-fashioned and hard to believe in spots. But despite this, it's still a good movie and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a lovely lady was connected to the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The movie starts five years later, after she realizes he's really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the most of it and does not dwell on how well life had been before this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money so the lady is forced to seek work. She becomes a personal nailress for a rich lady whose husband tries to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady they were trying to join a potential customer for an evening party was not ready for it, and the nail stress was paid fairly for being the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans well and the man is pampered with her! What to do now - when she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her? Well, see the movie itself to see how it's all resolved. I didn't like how they handled the man, as it seemed terribly predictable and clumsy. But when he was out of the way, I admire how the film also didn't give up a plate final and left the film with a couple of loose ends. All in all, a very good movie worth seeing, but certainly not great.
