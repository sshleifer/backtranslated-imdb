For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode, but in recent years it has been obscured by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it is more core Star Trek with this fascinating back story for the current Trek story. I still think it's pretty brilliant how Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to see the pilot, the idea that Spock is the court is a smart one. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the Talosians mind-control abilities and Captain Pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think too hard about the details and just enjoying ST's only two parties.
