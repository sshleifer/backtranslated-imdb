Unfortunately for myself - I stumbled upon this show late in its lifetime. I only caught a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the story - but most of all the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and City, so I saw two characters I recognized. (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (From Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I enjoy watching young actors get their guilt and felt that this show would continue their career together. I hope it will at least be put on DVD, and maybe WB will download it for another season sometime? Meanwhile, I see it on ABC's website from the start.
