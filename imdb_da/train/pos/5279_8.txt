I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this movie. In my opinion, this is an excellent movie, not only as a very human tale of the evolving relationship between a father and his adult son, but also as a small window on the world of practicing Islam for those like me who are not very familiar with this religion. An important aspect of this story is that of the young person's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude to religion seems to change in subtle ways as we evolve on their journey with them. <br /> <br /> This is a very thoughtful, fun and well-crafted movie that I would recommend to anyone with brain and heart.
