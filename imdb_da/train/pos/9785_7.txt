Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie to Hugo Weaving and I saw it to the end. It's one of those "drama of life" films when my mother used to call a movie depicting a story of reality without extraordinary events, and it's mostly descriptive. I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without much fault, but not too much. I longed for something like the interview, or at least some mathematical scandal here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story tells one that one faces one's own destiny and breaks free from the environment that others build for you, but it happens when the life-giving peach plant in the area is closing, so there is no need to do much to change things. <br /> <br /> The "clear" American Beauty song in the background song might have been part of a bigger soundtrack, but the only thing that played again and again became annoying after 100 minutes of movie. <br /> Finally, I think it did its job to present part of the Australian life, but for me it did not seem specifically Australian (it could have been located anywhere) and it did not seem that Be attractive as a story. <br /> <br /> I might be in a particular mood to like the movie.
