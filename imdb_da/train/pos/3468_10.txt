I absolutely loved this movie! I was reluctant to see it first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. But looking at "Two of us" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think the author did a fantastic job describing what "might have been". Aidan Quinn was sweet as Paul and met the challenge head. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was completely credible as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so exciting. The movie left me with both sadness and contentment, both of which feel appropriate to the circumstances.
