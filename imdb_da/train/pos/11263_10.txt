This is a great show! I had an American history teacher in high school who was very much like this. There are many "facts" in the story that are not quite right, and Mr Wuhl points them very well in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr Wuhl teaches a class film student, but history students and even the public will appreciate the witty way in which he reveals some very well-known mistakes in world history and strives to impress them on his students. The use of live actors performing "sketches" is also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the story they learned as a child upside down.
