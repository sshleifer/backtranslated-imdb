The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you don't have to see the original. Unfortunately, it is also the biggest drawback. It would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had evolved. Sinclair in the original is excellent and gives the movies the best comic moments as he tries to handle awkward and embarrassing situations, but supporting casting is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth should be congratulated with a courageous attempt to move the sign on and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawless and lacks the warmth of the original
