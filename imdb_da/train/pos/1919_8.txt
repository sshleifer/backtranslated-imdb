I haven't read the book that this was based on / inspired by. These are some (the others are movie roles) John Ritter's final work (RIP), one hopes it's fun. And it is. Almost every time he is present in this, as a matter of fact. Most of the casts, supports as well as regular, play well off and the material tends to be great. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy of that age, Kerry, the depressive middle-aged who fights for causes and consciousness, and Bridget, the fashion-loving, popular ditz. Sagal is a return to being the female leader in sit-com, and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a little after Mr. Three's Company went on, and for a while they couldn't seem to make their thoughts if they wanted to go to laugh or be excited and be respectful. One can wonder how or why it lasted so long after that: It could still be good, some of the additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of him consists of making his sktick) and had things to say . My personal favorite episode is last season. The mood is a lovely mix of "stupid person" jokes (mainly related to high school students), silliness, dark comedy and raw material. This treated sex and other adult subjects, but never graphically. The language is mild, and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend it to any fan of those who have made it. 8.10
