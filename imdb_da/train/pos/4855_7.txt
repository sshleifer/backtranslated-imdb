The question of whether you like this movie version of "Ghost Train" always depends on one thing and one thing alone: ​​Your reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. He tends to steal almost every scene he is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want him to settle down or take a little back to let the plot's many characters work and evolve (as they do to some extent). But somehow everything keeps pointing back to Askey's Tommy Gander character. Personally, I like the movie, and even as Askey to some extent. I always seem to plonk it into vcr at the odd hours of the morning when I can't sleep and really can't find the energy to see anything else. There's something about watching old b / w movies in the quiet darkness of the horror that I find appealing.
