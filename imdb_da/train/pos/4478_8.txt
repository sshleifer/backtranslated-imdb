All in all, this is a lovely, light hearted, romantic musical comedy. I suppose a small case could be made for the film to be too long. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. The song that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The amazing dance that Kelly does? No. How long does the film take to develop the story and develop the relationships between the characters? No (it seems to be a common complaint many times that newer films do not develop the characters). <br /> Some comment that Iturbi doesn't bring much to the movie, but it gives us a chance to see and hear a good talent from the 1040s. So what if he wasn't an actor? He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson to audition with him. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to the MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During her audition in the movie there is a shot of MGM brass nodding and smiling. You can only imagine that this was the case when she had made her genuine screen test years before. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life, it's hard to hit all the highlights. Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. A good counterpoint in the movie is how Sinatra (a ladies man himself then) played the role of just finding a date while on vacation. You will feel good after watching this movie. 10.7
