But as the days become weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them, they start to wonder if they are alone. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the series has a hard time keeping pace with the explosive pilot episodes that hit the group a polar bear, a giant beastie and the opportunity for others on the island. Nevertheless, the series manages to pick up after a few episodes and is excellent at the final episode. Possibly the biggest thing about 'Lost' is the fact that we visit the lives of every character before the collapse of a series of flashbacks. This gives us more insight and thus more excitement and excitement when the events unfold in the present. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this show is a great combination of drama, excitement and supernatural; It is simply unmissable.
