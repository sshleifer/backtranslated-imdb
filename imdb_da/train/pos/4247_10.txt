GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York City by knowing exactly what she wants: to make something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her knockout good looks, she quickly gets the eyes of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by keeping her faith in her virtue, will she also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. With her platinum hair and beautiful accouterments, she is a glamor. But her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. She rightfully earned her spot at the top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast gives Harlow good support: Lionel Barrymore as the wise old tycoon, wise to Harlow's ways; beautiful Franchot Tone as his son, struck by love; rattling Patsy Kelly, stealing his scenes as Harlow's sidekick; debonair Alan Mowbray, as a blessed English Lord; older Clara Blandick as Barrymore's feisty secretary; cordial Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; Muscular Night Pendleton as Lifeguard Catching Kelly's Flirtatious Eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. It should be noted that this film was produced shortly after Hollywood's production code was introduced. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - where Harlow's character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.
