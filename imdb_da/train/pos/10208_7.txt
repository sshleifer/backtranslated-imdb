We rarely see such short comments written by IMDb moviegoers. Maybe it is because this light dark comedy entertains and thrives without depth, or are we missing something? I would see it again if I had any incentive. <br /> <br /> So what is a coincidence? In French is the "Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We've all had these (it's called life), but when we look at this, you begin to get the feeling that "random" can be more like "fated." <br /> <br /> A "coincidence" in this movie can be an event as small as knocking a couple of leaves of lettuce on the back of a truck or as being bigger than basing a big life decision on the accuracy of a foreign caste. of a stone. All these events cause other events like ... and you get the picture? Domino. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 each, and you really need to stretch your imagination to accept the distant chance that this scenario can happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who think life is like this. But then it's the magical world of the cinema. We admit it is fun to see how the author / director interweaves these independent events in a story that diminishes the lives of those French citizens. If you have a few hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here is the place to do it. Or if you regain the surgery and do not go anywhere anyway, this will involve you while your stitches heal. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not go down like a prize winner, but it should develop a sense of culture. Alien things have happened. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard attributes the following: "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must live forward." If you look at the details of many of your own life experiences (fulfilling your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you will find a number of seemingly random events that lead to it. <br /> <br /> That's the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain "Happenstance" to me.
