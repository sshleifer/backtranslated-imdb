According to John Ford's lyrical shot, fictional biopics of Abraham Lincoln's life, his biggest mistake might have been an obtuseness with the woman and an ability to dance on "the worst road". Ford's camera has only praise for revealing Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities, it is in beauty and depth. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early films that could have been a series of beautiful stills, Ford has a unique eye to tell a story. The movie sings the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneous wise Lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film relates to two young men, brothers, trying for a murder that both claim to have committed. In classic angry mob style, the city decides to take justice into its own hands and lynch them paired until honest monkeys enter the frog. He charms them with his humor and tells them not to steal him from his first big case and that they are as good as lynch with him as the boy's lawyer. The following seems to be outlined for all courtroom murders, as Abe interrogates witnesses for the joy and humor of the judge, jury, and city before stumbling upon the missing links. <br /> <br /> movies play like many John Ford movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a drop of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm, that you're not sure if you're putting up the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite the obvious Hollywood feel of the movie and far too patriotic quarrel referring to Lincoln's future presidency, the movie is totally entertaining and pleasantly well-crafted if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.
