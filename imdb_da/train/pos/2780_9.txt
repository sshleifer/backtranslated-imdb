Fantastic movie - I loved it. Great editing and use of the audio track. Captures the real sense of Indian life, but we can all relate. A well-chosen cast with some beautiful figures. The film develops all the characters so you really worry about them all and you want to know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the football scenes is amazing, and the direction really works as everyone comes out as genuine and natural. You can just join that mess for Jess in this movie! The action was really good, even the tomboyish walk and body position of both leading ladies is very convincing as someone who played lots of football.
