For me, movies and plays are about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this movie, I thought the story of history by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was their best. Understanding and understanding the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel made this story more convincing. You could feel his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was greater than life. Susan Haywards fear, aversion, but when obedience to his authority as his king was beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel David's anxiety near that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. And the sadness when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massy's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. The sets were right enough and the atmosphere credible. All in all, I think it was one of the best movies of that kind. I gave it a rating of ten.
