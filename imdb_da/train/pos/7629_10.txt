Kurt Russell IS Elvis, clean and simple. His involvement in this role resulted in what I think is the best movie movie ever. If you are an Elvis fan, see it if you can. <br /> <br /> The film for television was made two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> There are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one to see is the longest. The shorter has more than one hour of recording edited out. It just doesn't work because the scenes in it often depend on the scenes that were cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis childhood through his emergence as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurts true father) are excellent as Elvis' parents. And Pat Hingle provides a very competent colleague Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the King!
