Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the big shakespeare like Olivier and Welles; and he further suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always brilliant, purely steals the show away. Olivier acknowledged the potential of his production and threw Iago with someone he knew he could arise. I hardly understood the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see also Venice's views.
