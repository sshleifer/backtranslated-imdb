As someone else has already said here, every scene in this movie is gem. Most movies are fortunate to have a scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit a home run every time. The cast just got the right one to take the excellent script, and besides, Dick Hyman made the musical settings of the opera and the other music a perfect match. It's hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood throughout the long production of a movie. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera work reflects every little emotional bend of the story. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I mostly know through his Frank Lorenzo role at All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80s) deserved much bigger star than he ever got, and Aiello's unhappy loser is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this amazing cast. Has Jewison ever written about this movie? <br /> <br /> Would love to read it. Hard to figure out why the average rating here on IMDb is so low ...
