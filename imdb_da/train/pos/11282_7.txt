This was the second of the series of 6 "Classic Tarzan" movies with Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. As usual, this was a wonderful movie in this series; and perhaps stand out as an "between" movie in a progression that could almost exemplify the evolution of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it turned out to be a good pace, but not as good as subsequent films. Also, the cinematography is less complete than later Tarzan films in this series. The stock I saw was of uneven quality that contained some grainy landscape and some underloaded and over-exposed scenes. The sharp view of later Tarzan movies is missing here. On the other hand, there is a scene, very early, where the jerky movements of a camera with leaves swear in front of what the camera backs up and shows safari men throwing in the jungle were really almost modern in style and standing strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, an interesting feature here was Jane's approach and instability when she was subjected to Martin's flirting. The kiss ?? and Jane's anesthetized, and partially guilty, reaction ?? foreshadow some of Jane we see in the future also in these movies. Compare eg. In Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's overall actions cheated Tarzan and delivered Boy to his family. Later, she admits Tarzan that she was wrong. Here is nothing quite so explicit, but we have Jane "back" to Jane Parker from yesteryear and in an almost inverse series of actions stripping off evening dress brought by Martin and Harry to lure her away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There were quite a number of depictions and sequences that particularly struck me in this view. First, the image we get from Tarzan's domestic life, here as later, is a combination of sensual idyll with always the obvious possibility of violent death. This to me is very much at the heart of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some rather violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan led the elephants into the elephant's cemetery valley; Tarzan is rescued from the hippopotamus of the hippo, and then the nurse of the monkeys; The Cheetah will find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; The Cheetah especially crosses the river on the log. The last battle scenes of wild and lion on the ground and wild and monkeys in the trees. Jane shows us that she is really of Tarzan's world now, and quickly shows her entertaining woodwork to build a stove to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is beautiful: suddenly, Tarzan is on stage, flinging wildly from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and calling the elephants to rescue! The last cry of Tarzan in triumph, with a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing and happy Cheetah next to them, is a strange picture and a great summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> Overall, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
