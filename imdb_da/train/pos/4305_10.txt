The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique piece where the connection of the whole plot would fail to convey much. It is central theme that seems to be the inherent uncertainty that life has for people in all races, backgrounds and stations. But preaching that the theme of the film would be terrible to undermine its scope. Similarly, in a particular genre, it is in vain in a particular genre. <br /> <br /> The movie has volumes to say, but probably different volumes for all viewers, and says it all in such a non-preaching way from so many angles that in the end, I can't even define its key message for myself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it does business with such laser precision; every plug, dialogue, and background music bar that contributes to the pervasive mood and powerful message that I am pleasantly surprised and get away very thoughtful after each viewing. Still, it does not feel stuffy at all. A sparkling movie with a great cast and everything works.
