This played at our theater in Amsterdam, and the movie we wanted to watch was sold out, so we went to this, without knowing anything else than it was a documentary about the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune as it was a very strong movie about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This movie has some of the most amazing images I've ever seen in a movie and took me from deserts to oceans to rainforests and showed things I've never seen in movies, TV or book! "Earth" is a film that every student should see before they are combed. I would urge my niece to watch this movie as she will inherit the planet we are leaving her. This is also a movie to watch on a theater screen or a very large TV, as the photography is so powerful and exotic.
