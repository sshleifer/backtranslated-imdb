This is by far one of the better made movies and did not leave me disappointed at all. The soundtrack along with well-shot handheld camera work was exquisite. It is always possible that a movie will not hold its beliefs as well as another, but I felt the rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning quickly becomes a staple in films that require a child with an old soul-eye and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken, they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light.
