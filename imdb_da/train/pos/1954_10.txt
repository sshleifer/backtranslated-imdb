I thought this movie did a good job. It wasn't as creative or original as the first, but expected it to be. It was a whole lot of fun. The more I think about it the more I like it, and when it comes to DVD, I will pay the money for it very proudly every last cent. Sharon Stone is amazing, she is always, even though her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, it is one of the movies that is underestimated in its lifetime and it will probably be a classic as in 20 year. Don't wait to be a classic, see it now and enjoy it. Don't expect a masterpiece or something that grabs and soul touches, just let yourself get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs. All in all, this movie is entertaining and I recommend people who have not seen it, see it because what the critics and cashier say doesn't always count, see it for yourself, you never know you can just enjoy it . I tip my hat to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
