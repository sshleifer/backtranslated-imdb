Tintin and I recently sent as an episode of PBS's P.O.V. series. It is based on a wallpaper interview by Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971, in which he discusses his various experiences, which publishes his popular character first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comics. Magnificent views of various comics and surreal images of Herges dreams. I first met Tintin at the Children's Distribution pages at my local primary school library that read Unicorn's secrets. My mother later got a subscription to CD, and I read the whole of Red Rackham's Treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comics in a local bookstore after that, but for some reason I didn't get safe enough because I was 12 and I thought I grew out of them. I have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herges death. Haven't read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life, as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his appointment (which he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Update: 9/4/07-I have now read Breaking Free. Tintin and Captain are the only common characters shown here, and they are tailored to the antitapitalist view of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a truffle with a chip on his shoulder, who still cares about the captain where he lives. The captain here just tries to make ends meet with a wife and a daughter whom he loves dearly. They and other construction workers promise to strike after an employee dies of a faulty equipment accident. It all takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact. Not that kind of thing Herge would approve, but an interesting reading anyway. Oh, yes, the dog Snowy only appears in the upper left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running over the police!) And the dedication side.
