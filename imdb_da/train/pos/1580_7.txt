This is not another scary look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events taking place on a small street in Berlin and some of the people involved. This movie is currently starting in New York City, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is saddened by her husband's death, and family members have all gathered for her side. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), so she travels to Germany and locates the 90-year-olds who tell her about the events at Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo would keep all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse Street though they were supposed to have immunity to be married to the arias and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release. The eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and have nowhere to go, but she meets 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann) who takes her in. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also in and finally tries to socialize with a Nazi officer to get them to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who makes her first feature film for nearly 10 years after working on television, and although this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts, she remains one of The most reverent directors in Europe. This is not one of the Nazi films where we see horrible acts of inhumanity to Jews, even though we see some serious treatment being issued, but instead it is more of a recall of a small event that involved them people were life and death. This movie does not attempt to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances, but what it will just do is simply shed light on a small but true life event that occurred in a historical period. Part of the film's strength comes from his actors, and there are some good performances shining through especially by Riemann and young Lohde, and it is always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a crucial role. This is not a good movie or something that will change your perspective on World War II, but given that innocent lives were killed because of the events that took place, I believe only the reason is important enough to tell this true story.
