From the excellent play of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) script, from the lavish film to the beautiful music score of Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in movie experiences: one that is almost impossible to find in any area. <br /> <br /> Several comparisons have been made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With great thanks to Mel Gibson, Braveheart hit me as too much of a self-conscious and preaching epic to rival Rob Roy as that kind of movie I would like to see more than once. While Braveheart is working hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy just takes you and absorbs you in his tightly edited story. Not a single scene is wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy features the perfect balance between dramatic excitement, action and even occasional humor. The characters are widely used and convey perfect languages ​​and manicures that anchor them in their authentic period. <br /> <br /> Also, they are not caricatures of good and evil which we all too often see in one's modern movie. <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope that the heroic Rob Roy rules, we realize that his predictions are products of his own pride and honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful villains in the history of the cinema, but there are moments when we can understand how events in his life have shaped him to be what he is. Rob Roy uses a level of character development that makes his story even more credible and poignant. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a lovely treasure that offers one of the greatest sword fighting ever choreographed and a climatic end worthy of all the excitement.
