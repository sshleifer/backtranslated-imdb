I can see why this film was nominated Oscar for Best Live Action Short, as it was masterfully built. Although you don't look like Blues (although it sounded much more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It is simply very well made, but for the life of me I cannot see why director Gjon Mili should only lead a movie - one. In other words, the film has been nominated and yet the director did not get any kind of career increase. As for the black performers, I could understand this and it did not transform their career into high gear, as most of the white society unfortunately has indifference (or worse) for black or "that kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you don't enjoy the previous part, you can move on to the 5: 50 mark - where it gets significantly. As the lady stopped singing and the artists began to improvise, the pace improved a bit.
