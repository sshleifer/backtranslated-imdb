Paul Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It was truly a pleasant surprise. The story is about bi-sexual author Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), when he is enticed into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and film photographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and morbid sexual images, this really draws you into the story, you don't want to see, but you can't turn away. This is by far Verhoeven's best movie (maybe just another for Robocop). True The fourth man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are completely free (just ignore them, but believe me if you watch for at least ten minutes, you will be connected. This is one of the movies you need to know how it ends, a real whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and exciting, i like the spider metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
