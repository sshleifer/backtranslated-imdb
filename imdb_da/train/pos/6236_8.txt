Plot intellect is about as bright as feather down. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of boy and girl we are used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat", now absent. Instead of the typical unintentional acquaintance, the dance duo are former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since their dance days. Of course, it's a 30-year-old musical that has the problems of misunderstood romance, classic courtship and the easy annoyance of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has cost Ginger something quite special. And then in the great tradition of dwindling economics, there's nothing better for Hollywood's best entertainers than put on a show. Delightful figures from Irving Berlin sprinkles all over the show. Top hats and evening dresses are saved right to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out again to charm the world ... and the charm of the Navy. Everyone and everything is just so much fun again. <br /> <br /> Pure classic silliness at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
