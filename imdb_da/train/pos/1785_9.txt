If you don't like a chick flick, stop right now. However, if you enjoy movies that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary plays, read on. Ann Grant Lord is dying. Her two daughters arrive at her bedside. Ann starts talking about people from her past, who daughters are ignorant, and they are asking whether these lost acquaintances are genuine or imagined. They will realize that these people from their mother's past are real. The story changes essentially between 1953 and approx. 2000 with a few glimpses in Ann's life between these years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of his life and experienced the greatest tragedy of his life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends from college, Lila, is married. Ann's second best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Purple and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer who lives in Greenwich Village, who wants to be a free spirit, but is still bound by many of the 1950's conventions. <br /> <br /> Soon after Ann will be the house corner at Lila's wedding, she meets the person who becomes the decisive character in the Three-Harris life. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and is becoming a doctor in a small New England town. Ann is instantly enchanted by Harris, adding a complication that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but in 1953 he has redirected the gay desire for Harris to his good friend, Ann, for he cannot admit himself to have a sexual desire for another man. Buddy shows his inner frustration by being the alcoholic, cleverly cracking bad boy in the family - much to his very right and tight parents chagrin. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all these expressed and suppressed feelings lead to tragedies - after all, it is a chicken. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Ann's daughters have become distant from their mother and suffer their own understanding of life and doubts. Constance is working on emotional exhaustion trying to quit her roll as a perfect mother and wife. Nina, who has always felt worse, cannot maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Touch all these relationships for a period of fifty years, and you get an exciting look at society, its values ​​and its effects on the personalities and actions of the complexes involved. All they perform in the evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this movie so much, very special. Claire Danes plays the 1950s Ann, and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of the times that conflict with what she must do as opposed to what she wants to do. Her performance is not easily forgotten. Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose mind changes from the present to the past of fantasy flights, and of course, Redgrave draws it all with sterling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the movie. The scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful experience to see. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Ann's second daughter, Nina. Nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while closing a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a lot like this, but I have never seen her give a bad or incredible performance, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> In 1950s, Mamie Gummer plays Lila and shows us a woman even more contradictory of her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gamer's mother - plays today's Lilac. What to say about Meryl Streep, except that she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance. Director Lajos Koltai said in DVD extras that he was looking for Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he would like to play a scene in the movie. He was right, and Luk's performance in one scene etches it into your mind. All the other scenes where Close is Lilas very real mother, and you get another performance. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the movie, combined with the one containing the exact described above that makes whole movies worth seeing. On Lila's wedding day, Ann enters her room and creeps into bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misconceptions about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated 50 years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In the latter scene, Streep and Redgrave are enthralling. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes. A very special movie with incredible plays, direction and landscape? Definitely. I can't recommend the evening too much.
