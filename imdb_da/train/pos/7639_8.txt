It's not a big movie. The action is not amazing (some sub charters are even played badly), the movie is not beautiful in any way. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this one isn't for you. but it has a great - really big plus on the story. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we did not ask for a date, the test we have failed, the friend we let down, are all in our history. This movie works because it touches it. It's a great story because it's a little. It is the life we ​​all have, with regret we all have, and yet the message comes: every life we ​​could have lived would have had their disadvantage. The first time I saw it, I was 15. It was shown in a party at my school. 16 years later, I keep reflecting on it every time, and every time I see it, it puts a smile on my face. See it. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
