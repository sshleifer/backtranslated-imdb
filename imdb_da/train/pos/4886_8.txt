The last of the Blonde Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman in the loose. She has spent most of her life being the obligatory wife and mother, but has never been really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth has her regular lunch with her mud children when she sees a street performer. This sparks reminiscent of when she was a member of an all-girl swing band in London during World War II. We soon learn that the band was not as much a girl as a drummer was a man dressed as a woman like some as it was hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls out her scissors (as she has been secretly throughout her marriage) and joins guitar-playing street musicians. Elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist and the money starts to flow in. She does not take money as she is wealthy and does not need it. Her game is strictly for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the band's drummer. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - the ladies, and Elizabeth - only fifteen at that time - was the only band member who didn't experience Patrick's "talents" other than drum. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her grandchildren to get the old group playing again for the grandchildren's school dance. Thus, a lovely trip down the memory court combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all starts with some really good swing and blues. I suppose I am at the age when I really enjoy older actresses doing their thing and this movie is a treasure chest as it not only stars Judi Dench, but she is supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and a series of spicy British character actresses. This is completely topped by Cleo Laine's extraordinary voice. Yes, it is fluff, but quite lovely and extremely entertaining fluff.
