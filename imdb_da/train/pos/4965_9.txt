Of all the football movies I've seen, this is one of the 2 best. The other is pyre height. But Hero is about the biggest world championship ever and thus also the biggest player ever to play in a world champion, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him mainly, but also revolves around the other giants in the game at that time. <br /> <br /> The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. The story of Michael Caine is appropriately impartial and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the World Cup's individual games; It is rather about the feelings of the players and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games like France against Brazil (one of the biggest games at all times) was covered in the same vein. The final Argentine VW Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of the world football. to be seen again and again, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
