This film is of the essence of the generation for some of us born in the early post-war years (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved to spend Saturday afternoons in your neighborhood movie house) so you certainly saw . And remember to see it has probably stayed with you. It's style is a short and somehow brilliant exciting moment in our growing days. <br /> <br /> It had a modern, space age storyboard for the audience of that time. The set was any city with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in 'why can't they let us have fun' rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause. All signs were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the police - were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them all <br /> <br /> It had a unique horrible monster. It is the first victim to be heard, it hurts ..... it hurts and we were convinced and afraid. The threat is constantly growing throughout history. There are intense periods of excitement, colorful effects, a fabulous McQueen leadership, and moments of humor, both calculated and not. It even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make them more sensitive to us wanting to cry. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the summer, age 9 or so, double-counted with 'In Married A Monster from outer space', and was so excited by the experience of this particular dual feature that I went back a few more times before it went. Everyone I knew then. Everyone I knew loved it.
