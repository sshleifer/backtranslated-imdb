In War, Inc, we find the logical expansion of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities that we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the antiquity of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad, you are already halfway home to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit man named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly released country as his cover while waiting to access his latest goal. Although he finds himself fascinated by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We're introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him since and the company's assistant named Marsha Dillon, who actually runs the entire operation for him (and played fun by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played appropriately over the top, they are not always the moments you expect, and the little touches often catch you by surprise. All main characters are in solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to removing the Disney image. Tomei is fun but undervalued, while Cusacks own almost all the scenes they are in. To be fair, they get good materials. The authors turn into a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling all the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the ending is the only thing that keeps me from judging it higher as history twists and makes it the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your comedy broad and physical, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested throughout the movie. On the other hand, if you like blunt comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
