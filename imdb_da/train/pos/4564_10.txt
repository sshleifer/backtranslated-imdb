If there was ever an inspirational story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to continue despite the odds and do it (even when "doing it" as an expression, one can have a wide berth, which is an ultimate personal truth) My left foot is it. It's a tough movie to watch at times: to see the less quiet aspects of Christy Brown's personality appear in two key scenes - one when his sister declares she's pregnant and getting married while his father has a bad reaction and at a dinner table, when the woman who came out to him enabled him to communicate effectively, has now at a key moment announced (the dedication of Brown's art) she is marrying another man - is hard. Very, very hard. More, because it is a man who cannot respond in accordance with these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: through screaming, screaming, and fates aiming to hurt himself. However, this is not a story of heartache and family function, although there is a part of what submits to the autobiographical account, but that a man who overcomes his serious disability becomes a working man and a force considered in art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful and unforgettable performance as the flawed but persistent Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker also made it his supporting role as Brown's regular mother.
