If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this movie and it was intercepted by the producers. In many respects, it was a typical 50s movie music by the free unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with great help from Gene Kelly. Gershwins was, of course, among the largest of all Broadway musical teams, but in my opinion George was among the greatest of all American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest men's dancers in the film music (a resurgence to the other?) And I can't imagine his cast ever being in doubt. But I think the rest of the cast needs an explanation: Oscar Levant was a well-known personality of his time, and as a real friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a known neurotic and hypochondriac, and here he plays as always. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at this time, and she was of the French "gamin" type. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Gu√©tary, who plays Maurice Chavalier, oops, I think Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but he is certainly more than OK as French boulevardier, although it is a little too young for that part. <br /> <br /> The voice of the genes chief can be used here, but Guetary has much better voting equipment. Although Gene was better thrown elsewhere as, of course, in "Singin 'in the rain", where his character is much more computational, he shows himself to be something of a heel at times (he was not for nothing, cast as original heel Joey in Pal Joey, Broadway musical.) I wasn't so enchanted with his "I Got Rhythm" scene with the kids who didn't seem so spontaneous as it was supposed to be in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the movie is, of course, the long ball at the end of the movie based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of great French impressionist painters. I found it hard to believe Gene and Oscar as struggling artists, and I don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they could be, but in balance, the Gershwin music works very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well finished with fine clear graphics (when assuming oath to be) and the mono sound is good, but a little low.
