"Kennel Murder Case" starts at a race and does not stop at the very end. Everyone had reason to kill the victim and several tried. William Powell is amazing as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as the evil niece who will only marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her legacy. This movie comes paired with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to rent the disk (or check it out from your local library), do so. It's pure entertainment!
