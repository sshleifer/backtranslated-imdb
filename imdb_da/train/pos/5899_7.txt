Sweet idea ... salesman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small little county in Lampidorra. The country that was not even in North America was made as the 49th state ... (of course there were only 48 states at the time when this was made in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country she has inherited and we follow her together as she tries to find out what to do with this strange country and its even more frightening people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people Navajo and it is becoming increasingly sillier from there. Though Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and tiny smile never shakes or melts. There are other songs scattered throughout which citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a brilliant British version of technicolor, or something similar, if the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese supplier. Bogarde made a big splash in the British film industry after serving in the war and even became the knight of QE II. Craig and "the new princess" bump into each other and their adventures become more intertwined when Lampidor's financial problems worsen ... Fun little farce .... like Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the author and director of our little project, and was married for 50 years! The guest was better known for writing and managing his sci-fi flicks, both in the UK and the US.
