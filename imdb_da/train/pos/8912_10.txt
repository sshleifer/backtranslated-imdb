I've read many comments on this site that criticize The Blob for being cheesy and or campy. The movie has failed for amateur plays and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell those critical critics that this movie never took itself all that seriously. This fact must be clear from the inconsistent theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening point. For what it was supposed to be, this movie is excellent. I've seen a few of the latest ultra low budget trials, the Blair Witch Project was one of those that has absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted and thoroughly entertaining. The scene in which the old one comes across the meteorite and the pokes mass contained in a stick was done excellently and truly unsafe. The scene at the hospital with Blob slowly moving under the rug on the gurney while consuming the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00, inflated to today's dollar value and make a movie anywhere as entertaining and or as successful as Blob. It just can't be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
