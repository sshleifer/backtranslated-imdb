The reason does not begin to describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather, * this * movie. It is completely self-explanatory to the point that you think it will fold into itself as a black hole. The author writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It is very philosophical, like "Waking Life" but more Zen-oriented and for that matter much better, in my opinion. At some point there are person-on-the-street interviews, and then you see pictures of these people being filmed, and then you discover that their answers will be the script when keeping flubbing their lines. There are beautiful scenes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD so I can see it again more carefully. Seen at Cinequest (San Jose, CA Film Festival) on 2/25/2002.
