This show was a landmark in American comedy when it was the first sitcom to steal an entire African American cast. Unfortunately, it was never cast on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. Dad's James, he's trying to drive the house, but his wife Florida always gets better off him. The three children are the artistic JJ, the mood Thelma and the young intellectual child Michael. Always going to the house is Florida's gossip friend Willona. <br /> <br /> I saw two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - the only two on the spot). You might think why an English viewer has seen a series that has never been shown or hardly heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, Britains first became all black sitcoms called "The Fosters". Only two series were made and it now seems to be forgotten. But I saw an episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Perle's gossipy friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I have written a review about it). While looking at "good times," only two things have annoyed me. First, the opening theme was (terrible) and secondly, the audience was laughing. I like the audience laughter, but in this someone would say a little fun line and the audience would get angry and start clapping. Apart from that, it was a very fun show. Let's hope more episodes appear on youtube and hope someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Series 1 Episode 6. Foster's Episode of It's called Sex in the Black Community. The second episode I saw, Black Jesus was a title of an episode of "The Fosters"
