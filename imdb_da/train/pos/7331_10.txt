In a time of magic, barbarians and demons are ravaged by a devilish tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the realm of the ice and wants to conquer the fire area controlled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra has been kidnapped by Nekhron's goons, a warrior named Larn has to protect her and must defeat Nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> A nicely finished and superbly underestimated animated fantasy epic combines live actors with animation scattered over them (rotoscoping), it's Ralph Bakshi's second best movie only with "American Pop" as number one and "Heavy Traffic" is third and "Wizards" are fourth. It is definitely better than his "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork is designed by famous artist Frank Farzetta, and the animation has good color and there is also a hottie for the guys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD from Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian", "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal" , "Starchaser: Legend of Orin", "Fantastic Planet", "Princess Mononoke", "Nausicca: Wind of the Wind", "Conan The Destroyer", "Willow", "The Princess Bride", "Lord of the Rings (1978) "," The Sword of the Stone "," Excalibur "," Army of Darkness "," Krull "Dragonheart", "King Arthur", "The Hobbit", "King's Return (1980)", "Conquest", "American Pop" , "Jason and the Argonauts", "Clash of the Titans", "The Last Unicorn", "The Secret of NIMH", "The Flight of Dragons", "Hercules (Disney)", "Legend", "The Chronicles of Narnia "," Harry Potter and The Fire of Goblet ".
