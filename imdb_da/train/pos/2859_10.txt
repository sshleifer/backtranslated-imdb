I know it sounds weird to come from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped flying, but I love this show. I don't know why, but I enjoy seeing it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found buying the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but it's okay. I will continue to look online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy the other through 14 seasons, send me an e-mail to darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only down side is that the DVDs are from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and my computer. Oh good. I still own it!
