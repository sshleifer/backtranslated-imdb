This movie really woke me up as it awakens the greatest male character of this brave different movie from his life-rack. This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life with a bank counter in a small provincial English town until the astonishingly beautiful, wild, girl-to-die for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia. walks into his life to become his beloved wife, at John's plan. But a glitch pops up - Nadia doesn't speak a word of John's language. Even though it is quiet and emotional outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that, instead of using the full repurchase policy for the corresponding service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. What's going on from there? in the plot, really bad john shakes from his sleep of a decent-paid, secure emotional to a decision-making decent-thinking action figure that gives the viewer a subliminal message "you would probably have acted the same way". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a good team that appears Russians and they can hardly be distinguished from the real thing, "almost" only because of the small accent that is present in their Russian dialogues, however, are small enough to amaze a native Russian of the hard work done to make the words sound right. Nicole Kidman again proves his talent by playing a character that is completely different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is fast and captivating, and you are definitely not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you feel you are in the middle of the plot and are back with a desire to see the successor as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this movie straight away and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, big acting and ideas beneath the surface. Just as the idea of ​​the "rude awakening" from the artificial safe routine life on a wheel in a community's machine was the life that members of Fight Club were so eager to finish and the machine that Pink Floyd sings to ("Welcome to the machine ! "). I bet that in the end John was far away with Sophia on the way to the unknown, but he hadn't met her at all. <br /> <br /> Thank you authors, for the great story and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can arrange it anywhere and name the location regardless, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to 99.9999 percent of potential viewers I'm sure of it.
