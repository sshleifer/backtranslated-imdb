Personally, I thought the movie was pretty good, very good actor by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer fame. I really can't say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and generally I thought the movie was just too long. Apart from that, the film contained a fantastic functioning big game and many places were beautifully shot, great effects and a lot of sword games. Another strong effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can't say more about the movie, but if you are just prospect of Asian cinema is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it, but if you are a tough Asian cinema fan I will say this should be in your collection very good Japanese movie.
