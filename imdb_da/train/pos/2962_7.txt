Parker and Stone transplant their entertaining humor from their animated masterpiece to a live movie with live action movies with generally good results. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt runs crazy with their new toy box. The reason is simplicity: two average guys invent a new sport, a mix of running basketball with baseball scoring that becomes a national craze. Along the way, they meet numerous sporting movie clich√©s and send them along with any other popular culture that enters their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode with the usual machine gun dialogue, toilet humor and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a weakness, it is the association with the team that gave us the "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series. This influence is evident in the powerful use of lame singing and the presence of a shiny and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a bit better playing corporate bard, who has been his party ever since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine is the only one he can do, but one must admit that he is perfect for the role of the lunatic teamaker . /> For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable than rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests itself in prominent soundtracks in almost everything they create. As usual, they offer a good selection here, including the obligatory track from their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA. A special mention should go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some kind of prize to hold hard jobs playing Stan to Parker and Stone's furious Cartmans. In summary, this is an entertaining comedy held back from its full potential by over-reliance on "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or terribly) if they got full control of a future movie. America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.
