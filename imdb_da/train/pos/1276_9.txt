I love this movie. The Noir image combined with Spillane's no-nonsense character Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and rarely feels found in low budget detective films from the early fifties. It may not be 'The Maltese Falcon', but this film makes it a solid contribution to the genre. The games are often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his 'ladies' are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. The bad old Mike Hammer, who is effectively played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the mysterious psychiatrist's beauty as he meets when he examines an army mate's death. When the crown finally falls, his face is a picture. Good to see that the 50s censorship did not force the filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A bona fide low budget classic.
