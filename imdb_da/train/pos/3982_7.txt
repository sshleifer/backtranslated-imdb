This particular Joe McDoake's short topic was obviously inspired by Warner Brothers spectacular spectacular Thank You Lucky Stars, one of the all-star war moral boosters of the period. In one Eddie Cantor, both himself and one would be comedians who would like to break into movies apart from his resemblance to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, starring in the McDoakes shorts, is both himself and McDoakes just trying to pause in movies. As a thank you for your lucky stars, a few Warner Brothers gathers together with a free moment that struck through this movie. O'Hanlon has been sent by casting to a small one-line role in a world war movie, but lookalike McDoakes gets the message. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he begins to think of ways to deliver his one line. Maybe sounds like a real movie star would help. <br /> <br /> 86 later comes to the bill Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook, who plays a British cockney soldier, find a niche in the poor McDoakes film industry. It's worth seeing this very fun short topic nominated for an Oscar to find out what's happening with O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
