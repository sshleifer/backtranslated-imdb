This is a scary movie. Creepier than anything David Lynch, and it shows what a good director Polanski is, as this is not his usual type of work, and it is BRILLIANT. It all starts with Trelkovski moving into a rental home in Paris. He quickly learns that the former tenant, a young woman, committed suicide, and he believes that the rest of the people living there drove her to it. He also thinks they are trying to do the same with him. What results are a fantastic and scary look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The whole production has written classic horror everywhere: from the picture to the music, the viewer can feel the bad Trelkovski's terrorist build. <br /> <br /> Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe just drive him up? Is there a difference? Find out for yourself. 10.10
