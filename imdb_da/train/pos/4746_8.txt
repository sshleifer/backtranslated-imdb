This movie seems to draw a borderline - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who find it unbearable. <br /> Initially, there is a terrible mass of comedy in this movie, many viewers are not "getting". Of course, Jet Li's Mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he'll probably say it's a joke. The guy who has a time bomb sewn to his heart - scandalous? Of course it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask if this movie should be so fun, why all the violent and violent violence? Well, first, the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; And while the Hong Kong audience would recognize that the violence is extreme, it is definitely just a little more than the average for a HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Also, Black Mask is really the kind of movie that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of seeing people shot without noticeable open wounds, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde, and the wildlife portrayed scattered blood everywhere. But the fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal projectile, it is almost certain that the blood will spit, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese cartoon movie. It is true that the Spiderman films never make it victorious - but if they were faithful to reality, they would be! Well, despite its comic book origin, this movie is true to reality. The only complaint I have is the flashy, over-stylized filming and editing. If the film's makers had shot it with an eye for Hollywood-style nostalgia (such as The Rocketeer or the latest Sky Captain movie), I doubt anyone would have found it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it stands, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
