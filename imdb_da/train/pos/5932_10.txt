Best Stephen King movie along with IT, though this is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> One has it all: <br /> <br /> A big throw with an Alice Wars and Brian Krause and a fun como from King himself; <br /> <br /> - veldosed horror in an entertaining story; <br /> <br /> good use of music, Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk" in particular; <br /> <br /> -like characters in a typical King setting: in the middle of nowhere village; <br /> <br /> - Lots of humor. You can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top; <br /> <br /> -gold but really nice makeup effects that they don't do anymore! <br /> <br /> A 4.5 rating: I don't really understand. When was the last time a horror movie was as fun as this one?
