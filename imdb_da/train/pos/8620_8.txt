I just finished seeing my 139 widescreen version with some friends and we were blown away. I will not bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The big blow is exhausting. Afterwards, we were stunned to find that there were still almost 30 minutes left to go, but that didn't stop us from being totally involved and entertained. There is one thing that almost ruined it, and it was terrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here, and each time they are used, we all broke into laughter. It's horrible. You have been warned, but the story and the story keep you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are several amazing moments that enable you to appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that works beautifully. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Look it up. It's fun, it's different, and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect, and it's very refreshing.
