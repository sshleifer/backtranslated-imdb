"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a <br /> <br /> long time. The action from <br /> <br /> the outstanding ensemble cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman puts an excellent performance and is electrifying every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke matches his scene for the scene and Albert Finney simply chews on the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, <br /> <br /> criminally underutilized but looks great for her 42 years. Scripture is excellent, the story is non-linear, but easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, has proved to be a gem with this!
