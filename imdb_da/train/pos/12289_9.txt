First, I would like to point out that I did not read the book, so there was no chance that I would be disappointed with that aspect. The big mistake I discovered was historical detail with more cars, trains, clothes, etc. I don't think at that time was home. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is ok, nothing to brag about. But the play I think was amazing. I have no experience in acting, but I still can't believe how people can consider this terribly! Maybe they have only seen two films (ever), and the other must have been really good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood his character, one who crawled the social ladder with very hard work, so fighting against those who would take his life's work from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he does not know that the cause is no longer at his side, and he ends up with a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made this so credible, I sympathized with the character despite his brutality. After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas, he had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not up to the other players' standards. Look out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between so many stars. Unlike today's films, only the interpretations mean only humans, but at the same time it is not a pretentious movie, too worried about being intellectual. The best proof I really liked, I write a review 7 years later.
