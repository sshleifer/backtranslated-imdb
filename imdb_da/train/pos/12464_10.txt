Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what more can you ask for? Monkey Grip based on the award-winning novel of the same name explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a lone mother who falls for a heroin addict Jobe (Friels).) A simple story is made really extraordinary through the all-round grand play (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and good use of it small budget.The only fault is (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although the movie was shot mainly for budget reasons in Sydney, as a result in a few scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton post office (Sydney scenes). Apart from that, "Monkey Grip" is a must see (sorry clique, but it is) at least for an award winning achievement from former "Play" School and "Better Homes & Gardens" the presenter Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
