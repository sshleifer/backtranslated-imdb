Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say this is a rather outdated movie and performance by Clara Bow. Though the story was quite typical of Clar's later silents, I still find it a bit reassuring and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop by nothing to win the man she loves ... never mind this man is married! Clar's lack of modesty was shocking today, but I think it was the movie's sweetness and general fun. Although it's not a great storyline (quite typical, actually), this movie is a great showcase of Clar's ability to make the audience laugh.
