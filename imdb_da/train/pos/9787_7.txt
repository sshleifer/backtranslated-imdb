This story is beautifully acted. It is both sad and cordial about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where to go. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and ever since she has been labeled 'the miracle child', she is dyslexic and finds life a little hard. Her finds along the way affect those who are closest to her. Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's former boyfriend is handled very delicately and sensitively, and the entire support casting is genuine, three-dimensional and trustworthy. Set around a peach canning factory in the small town of Australia, this is a warm gentle, erotic film and leaves you with a comfortable feeling when the credits are closed. After reading some of the other slightly superficial comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliant and very sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean he's not attractive.
