Contains * spoilers * - also my quotes should not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always notes the satire in social comments and economic parallels - how true. But for me, I see this movie so much more than that. I love this guy's symbolism in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him, but it won't stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his gritty laugh and eternal curiosity are so fitting: <br /> <br /> "It's brilliant - can you tell me what is the relationship between ink and gasoline?" <Br /> <br /> The only moment in defeat is, when he realizes that his invention has not worked, it is almost naked. But more than shame is the simple disappointment that "it didn't work." He's never really scared of people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we'll also stop it." <br /> <br /> Barely a moment's hesitation before he's out trying to get away again. Has he shown signs of the pain that such treason must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the role of Baptism. She is sick and tired of money and power. She believes she has finally found love outside her father's business. At first, she doesn't care about Sidney more than anyone else. But the moment he falls out of his car and she goes back to see if she might have killed him - and yet he still only thinks of the beauty of his invention. She has finally found something that she thinks is worth living for. The funny thing is that it's not even romance. It is friendship, but of such a noble nature that the title hardly fits. It is more admiration, and perhaps even inspiration. <br /> <br /> After her discovery that Michael has no true love for her and that her father is totally incompetent to take care of her, she goes to cynicism and tries to tempt Sidney. Fortunately, she finds that there are really people in this world who live for more than power, money and desire. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. If you would have said" yes, "I think I would have choked you." <br /> <br /> I completely love the end when all this crazy company seems to have come to nothing. But then begins the bubbly, bubbly blow, and Sidney goes out, his steps fit the tune: dauntless. Where's Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love, and she was not really a scientist. He got help to escape, and she got a shot in the hope of hope. (Pollyanna) A continued relationship would have been good, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I had hoped for ..." <br /> <br />
