My Goodness. This film really shows the talents of reality. Billy Connelly bends his actor. Really a great man if you look at him in Absolution as a rebellion, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer, and finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks from sweet to scary, absolutely fantastic! Cariie Ann Moss is also not hack! Jump in the career of Matrix and Momento as a darker character, to a warm warming conservative 1950 housewife! Rarely these days to see that the actors cannot be so molded. <br /> <br /> Now on the story (No Spoilers, calm). This movie would make Max Brooks (Author of Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy with joy! Finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies if you don't like zombies if you're just bored, or if you're too busy, watch this movie!
