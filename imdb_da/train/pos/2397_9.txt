Having seen and loved Greg Lombardo's latest movie "Knots" (he also wrote and directed that feature), I decided to check out his previous work and this movie was worth working and renting. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek, excellent tag on Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed with the underlying knowledge and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the film's story in the film mirrors the story of the game itself - and very wise. Life's trials and tribulations in parallel many a Shakespeare game, and Central Park was rarely exploited better than the forest around Macbeth's castle. Mr. Of course, Lombardo has a distinguished place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Knots is a fun and warm sex comedy about six thirty something New Yorkers, located primarily in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood, with Manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown into good measure) and has spent a long time around Shakespeare's play. The film is paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama in the core of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare "game in a movie." I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
