The boys work outside a recording studio when they hear "an English voice". It would be Miss Van Doren who auditioned and went under Miss Andrew's name because her father did not approve of her being a "radio singer". But she hopes some big wig, Mrs Bixby, a friend of her father will hire her, and then he must give his approval. She leaves but within minutes running boys amok in the studio causing chaos and having other musicians out to kill them after they destroy the recording session. Finally, it's quiet. "Whew, we removed them," Moe says. "Yes, we also got away" replies Kr√∏llet. The boys then fool in the studio, put on Miss Van Dorsen's record, and the curls are dressed in women's clothing and pretend to sing. Mrs Bixby enters, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an extra $ 500, she is asked to come and sing at their high society party that night. The rest, as they say, is history that Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some fun results. Oh, by the way, he accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto." What happens at the party is simply that the truth wins, but not before a few slapstick antics take place. All in all, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't rate it as anything special.
