I have to say that as a BSG fan I wasn't quite sure what to think about this show. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center screening), and the film and filmmakers talked afterwards. Ron Moore said they would make a clean break from Battlestar and do something different and yes they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would win others. "Even without their talk, I am now a fan of the new show, but here's what I was thinking about the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really good. I think I'm a true sci fi (or 'syfy' - Should I really write it?) Geek, because I wanted to see this as a series, it has a strong and rich history and kept my interest, it starts with a small group of teens who plotted something that for me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. The actor who played "Ben" should have given us a glimpse of his intense beliefs. The actor who played "Zoe" seemed a bit posy, but she played a teenager ( and I'm sure I won't be the only one who thought "Zoe" was a Cylon in the beginning, dangers of being BSG geek.) If they hope they will be the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, They might like to rethink it. Surprisingly, it was the adults who caught the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Daniel Greystone, a man who is haunted by his family drama, jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and not getting away. He does a chilling and enchanting job of conveying the worn-out knowledge of his character to the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene where he spins a web for his daughters young teen turns, shuts her and then rejects and releases her . No sign of all the "serial killer" he played on Grey's Anatomy, really impressive acting. <br /> <br /> Just as strong, but not nearly as much, is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is as smart and well-written and beautifully played as Stoltz, and I totally believed that they are a couple and a couple who have been together forever and have a strong relationship that is rarely seen these days. I look forward to seeing what is happening to this family and hope that they will give her as much as Roslin in BSG. She is strong and smart, and when she knocks on her baby, you break, it's really good. Not to mention her eyes that could hold magical powers, it's so intense they are. The scene where she picks up the government agent - very short scene, but beautifully played - really gives you an idea of ​​her power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show that didn't work 100% for me was the scenes with Esai Morales, and his mafia-type clan. He does a good job in general, but I didn't believe in this mob's power or intimidated by their threats. I found myself wishing that this whole story line was a little more mysterious and hard to figure out; The way it is presented is almost a tribute to the goddess, they kind of hit you over with that little bit. But in time I can see how this will develop into an interesting 'Upstairs / Downstairs' kind of thing with the poor minorities (Morales et al.) Against the rich peoples who control the planet (Stolz et al.). And to be honest, I enjoyed it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name - it was a very well played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to BSG fans, the boy playing 'Willy Adama' doesn't look really like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Whether he wants to be more than he was in this movie, who knows? I probably couldn't tell that. But it didn't disturb me, because he wasn't as interesting as everything was going on around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays 'Sister Clarice' and she is chilling and strange in every scene she is in. I'm not sure where she goes or who she wants to end up, but I was very much impressed with her acting. In this movie she was kind of on the page, but was of course created to play a very important role later. She was nothing like her character in "Rome", something I always find impressive in the actors. <br /> <br /> A nice surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even though it is the same guy who does it, Carry McCreary It has a scary and unusual approach that surprised me I would buy This score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> Regarding the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very clever and articulate, David Eick was bluntly wise (like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was thrown, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not respond properly to the questions (but I have always had something for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she tasked Seth Green with mistakenly saying she was on '24') and the girls playing Zooey and Lacey were both treasure. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there and answered questions about how they made the scenes with themselves at BSG. All in all, a very interesting and wonderful evening. I give the exhibition a 9 out of 10 and look very much forward to seeing it all unfold. NOTE: I just saw this again and really hope they are exploring what HOLOBAND was originally made for. I have no idea what it can be, but it has a great fascination for me.
