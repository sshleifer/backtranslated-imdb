I felt I had to respond to the comments on the front page of this movie because some of it was a little misinformative. <br /> <br /> Originally, I wrote quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was correct, this is the "comments" index and not a bulletin board (although we used to use them back before IMDb added the movie) so I will edit this to make it unnecessary. <br /> First of all, you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin "panorama" movie, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "goody two shoes" roles he had played in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal") . Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to construct a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway, although Warners had banned the MGM for the rights to "Pal Joey." In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra was fit for the role, but other problems reduced the movie (script changes and poor direction. ============== ============== ============== ============== ================================================== ================================================== ======= $ is not well done, even referring to your art education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the story / characters The pictures are so bad, the audience knows that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even though he knows, even though Milo has suggested him to the point where he almost believes in her, but it is important that the audience does not sit there and say "But he is a great artist if he only had the chance!". You want the audience fully aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show and again understands You do not structure the story utes because he does not want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows that he is not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as "Joey's" enthusiasm for "starting a nightclub". But it serves the same function in the plot. Remember, it is important in "Pal Joey" (the game) that Joey gives up on his night club after he understands that he does not deserve it. Same with the art exhibition. If Kelly's paintings were actually good, it would undermine this whole point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I think it's in the eyes of the guards. I agree, chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine. Compare it to even worse "forced" romances like that between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it just shows you haven't dug under the film's surface in its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and the characters, and through the dance the plot is solved through images and symbolism. It is about finding love, enjoying love and losing love (he is looking around and his love is gone). The Symphony's movements are designed so that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you don't see it, it's not the movie's fault. It is certainly not a "crap". ==================================================
