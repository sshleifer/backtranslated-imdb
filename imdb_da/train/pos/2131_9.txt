This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuances in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a joy that brings sharp cartoon help. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the film, and his oily charm is well used here. Frank Morgan, is lovely as the owner of the title store, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very trustworthy in all aspects of his role. The two leads are equally successful, with Margaret Sullivan doing an excellent job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman. <br /> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart himself. The film is presented from its point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more than up to the task of carrying the movie with a great performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart when he gets fired from his job because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatically an event causes, so perfect. In my view, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest film actor in the history of media history. There is no one else who has ever been admitted to films capable of conveying so completely what he feels to an audience. At the time he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, but he is quite the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
