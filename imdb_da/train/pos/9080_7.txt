Maybe I should examine my head, but I thought it was a really good movie. CG is not that bad. I've seen worse. The appearance of being (and of creatures I mean the good and the bad snake) was pretty cool. The action scenes that involved the snakes were really good, I thought. There are sometimes logic at times, and history does not always make sense. But for a creative function, there is much worse. A lot of the other creatures seemed to be lifted from other movies, so it is not entirely original. I think the story is original, but it is a bit like Godzilla (the big budget American version) which liked a lot. I didn't like this movie so much, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked the music. All in all, I think Dragon Wars is about a 7/10
