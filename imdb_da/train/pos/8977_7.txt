As a movie there is almost no 4, but for movie fans in the 1940s, it is almost a must-see and bets a 9 as a show program! I was drawn to see this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was Doris Day's amazing performance. Outside of 'Calamity Jane' I have never seen her put over a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, though he does not see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost certain that Humphrey Bogart put a look. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track of. If it ever comes up to a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence if nothing else! <br /> <br />
