This film-based presentation of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is a most beautiful and interesting representation of Coleridge's haunting poems. The striking cinematography combined with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world-famous artists and Michael Redgrave's amazing tale, is very much worth looking at this excellent visual work. <br /> <br> In the age of television, such work as this is an invaluable tool for inducing young students as well as adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, this kind of work is rare; It is regrettable. As a student of world literature and as a former professor and academic advisor, I feel that several great epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be so "translated". Although it is not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am happy to recommend this fine production without any reservations.
