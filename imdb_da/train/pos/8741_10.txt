"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it has come across beautiful little bits that complement something really good. <br /> <br /> The story couldn't have been better; It's wise, has "heart" (feeling), and each character has a nice "bow" (a growth or change). In comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" are to have a "bow" Buzz that learns to love being a toy, and Woody overcomes his anger over Buzz. There are lots of laughs and sweet moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors have great voice work, and the animation, both the movement and the details, is amazing. <br /> <br /> This serious movie bird does not throw "10" easily, but this movie certainly deserves the "10" I gave it.
