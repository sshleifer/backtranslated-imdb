What another reviewer called lack of character development, I call understatement. The movie did not bash one over the head with overexploration or unnecessary backstory. Yes, there were many countless stories we only got a glimpse of, but it was primarily a one-day snapshot in an event that catalyzed change in all the characters' lives. Henry Thomas's performance was a very nice study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
