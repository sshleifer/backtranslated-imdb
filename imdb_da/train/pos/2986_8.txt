I'm amazed we even see a nay-saying criticizing this old movie. We usually do not achieve good opera films, and here is a true grand opera reproduction. Understandably, the images are not large. It's dated. But as an opera, it cannot be spoiled; and I'm an opera buff. I can't even detect a lip-sync; If we didn't know it was Tebaldi in the sound, nothing would convince me it's not Sophia Loren. She does everything with flair! Her dark makeup is fine; and she brought the role of the beautiful life! The rest of the casting is wonderful, as is the amazing ballet troupe. Most of the players are excellent; Loren really wonderful. Her rival Amneris is also fantastic. Anyone who didn't care about this 1953 job is shamelessly rejected. Value would have enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi is the Aida engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
