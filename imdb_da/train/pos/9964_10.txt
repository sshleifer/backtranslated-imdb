Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come by, the length is now standard and you have gone long enough without it. (When home video started, there were at least three versions with parts missing ..) Everything you read is true. There is no defense and no one lives without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at, and the production values ​​are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie epic. But no doubt all over Santa Vs. Satan's Angle is so jaw dropping STRAIGHT it made the movie a hit at the time, and a cool fave once home video really is going. How good / bad / strange / is it? I only saw TRAILER as a child and remembered it for almost 30 years. Including Murray's over the top voice over. I told my older sister and she called me a liar and couldn't believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where Santa vs.Satan .. Add to the thing that Santa asks about the Blessed Virgin Mary before going out on Christmas Eve , kids who want to catch him and make him their SLAVE..and an international kiddie sweat shop .. and it probably comes close to many nightmares the kids had in their 60s. Like others here, I see the matter every holiday season now. (My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it is the movie a demented masterpiece and a total must (along with Brianiac by the way ..). It never fails me to make me laugh. Better, I think, as SANTA CLAUS CONSERVES MARARTURES. Parts of it can still make you curl or just crawl out. (How many parents can you go for cocktails on Christmas Eve? "If you get bored, just go down and play the piano." DANG ..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, strange .. hi what else can you have?
