What an overlooked 80s soundtrack. I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs, but in watching the movie it seemed to personify everything that was the 80s cheese. Clear film that relied on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships was in style. The best part was his miserable Texas accent. Compare it to Friday Night Lights. I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of movies. Also as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie. I was so shocked to realize that I had never seen it. Another strange movie of this genre would have to include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that all these big stars played big roles in these CHEESY movies. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
