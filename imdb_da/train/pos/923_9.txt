I've never seen it on TV, but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found out it was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's fun and the animation is excellent. The level of quality I would only have expected from feature films, so I'm surprised by some of the bad comments about it. Maybe the DVD release was enhanced animation? A bonus on the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I am an adult and I greatly appreciate that it is for adults. It's not just kids who like cute animated characters. It's not far near "raunchy" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents don't want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
