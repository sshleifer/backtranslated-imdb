Though you haven't seen too many movies before, you've certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many movies since. <br /> <br /> Not one of Grant's or Loy's best films they make a great effort together. After all, with so much talent and very good supportive throw, you know that laughter is there. <br /> <br /> The movie is light, has some dramatic spotting, but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile all the way through. <br /> <br /> A great example of classic American film award that has been the time test. Definitely Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on popcorn.
