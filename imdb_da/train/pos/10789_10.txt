When I was little, my parents got this movie so I could see. I really liked it and I saw it again and again. Even when I was in 3rd grade, I saw it from time to time. Recently I have seen it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the show was not aimed at my age group (I am in my late teens), I still found it entertaining and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and goes well with others. Some parts I found quite entertaining. Also, this show has no bad content, so you can leave the kids alone with this show and not worry about them recording any bad language or not. I would recommend this.
