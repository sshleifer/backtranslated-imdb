I saw this series when it first came out in the 70s. I was 14 years old and I saw it at my best friends house when my father didn't want to see it. It was a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as someone will tell two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverent silence, it must mean that this was something special. The broad sweep of World War II events presents a difficult issue for document. So the decision makers broke it down, they considered the most important key events and made an episode for each one. Some episodes included long periods like "Wolf Pack" that covered almost all six years of the Atlantic struggle. while the battle of Stalingrad had an episode to itself. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made today simply because most of the interviewees have died. The list of important players is displayed, providing a great insight into thinking at that time. Anthony at the foreign secretary, Carl Donnitz, the eats of the submarines, Albert speer, pet architectural and later the Minister of Arms of Hitler. In one of the later episodes we see Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker, and it was for her that he dictated his last will and will - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped through the Russian lines . These and many others play a major role in the realism of the imagined events. <br /> <br /> If I have criticized the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included, but their revelations in the war came out only after the series was made so I cannot blame program makers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles and music are magnificent, and Lawrence Olivier's story provides a natural gravity to the script. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? undoubtedly. unmissable
