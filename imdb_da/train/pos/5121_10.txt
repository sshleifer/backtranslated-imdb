I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger are doing higher prices than average, I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the inner scenes were filmed in the club itself, and Gilley had low ceilings - maybe 10-12 meters high and smoke to simulate a "smoky bar" hung 2-4 meters below the ceiling. The camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a party! Sure there was an auxiliary light, but to maintain the bar's atmosphere there had to be low light images. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was excellent! He got some shots, he had no hope of achieving, and the effect of them created a sense of reality for the film. Thanks, Ray - Great work!
