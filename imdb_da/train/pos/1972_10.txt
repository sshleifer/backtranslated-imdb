I do not understand your objections to this movie. It is an exciting and exciting extension of the character created in the "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is that Sharon Stone's characters are still alive and not in prison at this late date. SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character revolves all these people because she is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis' crooked policeman kills these people to hit Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What disturbs most people about the movie is that none of these theories ever becomes pronounced as the "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care to kill the policeman, the only killing that takes place on the screen.) I think this is a brilliant plot unit in a spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey." WHERE DOES WHAT'S TRUE? The blonde is really crazy, the policeman is really busy and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interactions between these and other signs in history. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks, and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over it!
