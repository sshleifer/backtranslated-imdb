Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as freshly baked! Japanese bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-Pan, to Japan, and to the Japanese who will be recognized the whole world . <br /> <br /> Of course, it's just outside. In fact, Yakitate! Yes-pan is not really about bread, but the reaction that comes after eating the bread and the pun that comes with the reaction. The series is lovable because of these sayings. From popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to blockbuster movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. That's all there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Yes-pan is pure comedy. Well, there are times when the story turns to drama, or even murder, but the comic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at their own view of the sky. Just watch it. <br /> Just remember that this is also fiction, although some of the breads made here are based on real bread, eat homemade Japan # 2, won't turn to a Super Saiyan or turn your body into rubber .
