Thats My Bush is, above all, a very entertaining show by Parker and Stone, I thought. Its often very much fun and it is quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would definitely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. There must have been a lot of money in this and it shows. A lot of expensive little details. It's not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they put a lot into this show of course. In a sense I understand it was also the death of the show, but too expensive. It could certainly have been done cheaper and went on the will was there. <br /> <br /> The critics liked it, and it had its little fan base, but failed to get a big audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which I think is almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> Since I really liked the show, it's wrong. The problem with the show is that it doesn't know what it really will be. Its like trying to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well cast, but in my opinion they do not always get 100% the bizarre humor they have to present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the show needed some signs down to the ground for the show to work. In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, a kind of realistic touch in the more looney universe. I think it's a bit of what makes South Park work. You need some realistic characters that you can relate to, and that makes the crazy stuff so much more interesting also because it forces you to take them seriously at some level. If everything is archetypes and stereotypes, it's hard to get into the show emotionally, which really is Thats My Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are signs in South Park that make sense of the insanity of the show. We have nothing like this and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another spotlight is Parker and Stones who flirt with Republicans. It's the only thing about them, I really don't understand what they're trying to do. Don't portray Bush as nothing but a stupid Homer Simpsons kindness. It's a little subversive in a world, how many people can't stand him and think he's the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy world of Letterman and then only his every movement is satirized. But it's hard to understand whether Parker and Stone actually matter. Its like joke is on us, but somehow it doesn't hit the mark. It seems awkward because it doesn't remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> Besides, I actually thought the show was very enjoyable. Some of the jokes here are fun. The pro-life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes of them in any show. And the show is filled with great material, and sometimes it's fun fun if you use your head a little while you see it.
