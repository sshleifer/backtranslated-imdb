The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the eldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom sister pursues because she thinks he is the "big time" that will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life . Although he could be accused of killing her, he only kills his spirit and willingness to live, then becomes an addict and ultimately dies of an overdose. The story is not about street life or the Italian mobster trying to buy Stix off and threatening him. It's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life of the times for young women trying to be "discovered" then.
