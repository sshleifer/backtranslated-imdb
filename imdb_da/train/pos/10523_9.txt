Emma is a true romance. If you love the sweet things, loaded with daring and stupidity, you will love this movie! It is true for the novel, which is very important, with a few words added to joy. Gwen is not one of my fave actreesess, but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer in spades. She shines in a role I think no other actress could have done proper justice to. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, the hero. how shocked are you? I never looked at him as obviously beautiful but hey! What the right role can do for you! He looks so good as the sensible, royal Mr K, that I literally look at him in a new light. He makes and excellent romantic lead. The charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a good casting. A good movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. It enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
