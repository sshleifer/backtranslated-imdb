This is really a 'heart warming' movie. It won the George Peobody Award, which won over "Roots" so it can tell you something about the essence of this movie. I see on the Internet how to order this movie, since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-author of this movie has been deceased for a few years now, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would love to have her only grand daughters, my daughters, watch this movie, and pass this wonderful story to his grandson. My oldest daughter was seven years old when it was broadcast on television, and since then I have been looking forward to seeing it again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not 'destroy' this movie for you.
