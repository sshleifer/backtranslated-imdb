Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with the British music development in the late 70's should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film of a young women's attempt to make her into the music world captures the times perfectly from open sexism, gross economic times, social upheaval, to the shift in pop culture from gross thumb to terrible fake and pretentious Futurism / New Romance. The music and fashion formats created daily in Britain in the late 70s are still being rediscovered and reused (which has really been new since 1980). This was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and examines the cultural landscape, and both do very well.
