This movie may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin just came across Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satirical humor. This movie is all their grandfather. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as its strong entertainment value.
