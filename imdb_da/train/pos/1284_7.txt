I saw The Babysitter as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie packs a lot of history in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cyclists, lesbians, sexual inconvenience, extortion and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The leading players are doing a credible job. And I found the intricately woven plot to be trustworthy and interesting. <br /> <br /> But the support end, primarily the cyclists, delivers a stylish performance, especially when asked to deliver lines with more than a few words. Perhaps the right cyclists used instead of actors. A few of the characters were particularly unusually credible. <br /> <br /> The musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the time being, the pace and for moving the story forward. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in opening credits that the movie featured music by "The Food," I googled them; but couldn't find anything ... George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and starred in this movie, looked like the idea so much (by a colorless married man redeemed through trials and tribulations, and a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "Weekend with the babysitter."
