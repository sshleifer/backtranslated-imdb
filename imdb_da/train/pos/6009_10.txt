Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a campus uplift and he flies all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flying it himself. <br /> <br /> Once out of the desert, Mark marks a car from the air. A young woman named Daria steps out and sees Mark circling in the plane. Mark floats the plane very low several times, causing Daria to appear or be hit. When he lands, he becomes acquainted with Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's aerial heights. <br /> <br /> After engaging in a fun conversation for hours, Mark and Daria become naked and love the sand. But with Mark avoiding the law, they realize that he must continue to drive. So Mark and Daria's short tryst is quite exciting because it does not develop into a thoroughbred romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was Eraserhead from the early 70s. Both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was as innocent as his character was in this movie. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While driving his prison sentence, Mark died an immense death. He was killed by a weight of 150 pounds, which fell on him when he was weight lifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the amazing filmography and special visual effects. The incredible, slow motion scenes of garbage floating in the air after an explosion were a brilliant blow. Although it wasn't like a groundbreaking movie like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point was still resonant with the early 70's counter-culture. I recommend it for those who like avant-guard movies that highlight the upheaval of the youth uprising in the early 70s.
