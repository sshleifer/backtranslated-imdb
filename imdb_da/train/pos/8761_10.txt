I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The movie is only wrong because it seems that the two accused appear to be in some monastery that works as monks in the grass and under strictly almost martial arts-like discipline. Plays and filmography and amazing colors of what is to be considered Thailand are striking, but Claire Daines steals the whole movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the difficult lesson of life itself, in an act of incredible selflessness unheard of completely unexpected in the real world. The shortcomings are minute and I recommend the movie, which seems to be buried unfortunately forever for rare television shows. I for one want the movie for my collection - a collection of only "10" rated movies. Look, you get very touched.
