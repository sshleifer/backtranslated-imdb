Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" has achieved classic status thanks to timeless history and outstanding plays, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainer's performance is so complete, she is almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long one), Rainer instead relies on facial and body language. She looks and works Chinese to the point that anyone who is not familiar with her work can easily confuse her as such. <br /> <br /> The movie remains relevant today because it explores the staircase to the rich history and the universal themes that come with it. When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve economic success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life filled with possessions but lacking in meaning. It is only when they return to the ground after turning off a carob of carob (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to see) that they again find fulfillment. A common formula told with the Chinese family's unique perspective (especially in 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is not worth anything without friends and family, a point that the film runs perfectly in the last 10 minutes with an emotionally satisfactory conclusion.
