I've seen almost all of the Gundam / Mech anime that has appeared in the US and this has by far the best story. The way its plot twists you riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that primarily focuses on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to run the latest mobile suits known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight a strong uprising known as Oz. As things start to warm up between OZ and Gundam pilots, new political groups will be formed, and the old ones will disappear. Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. To achieve peace, Gundam pilots must address the events of their world and complete all the fighting. But how far are people willing to go to achieve their goals. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep plot.
