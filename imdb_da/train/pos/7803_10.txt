I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. it was exciting and was an excellent insight into what actually happened to Steve Biko during the apartheid law. How anyone can say that this movie was the most boring or boring 2 and a half hours in their life, I don't know because it had made me hang from start to finish. It was amazing how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he fought the apartheid law and gained equal rights for black people. In some, Steve Biko says to a policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, showing them that he and all the other black people in South Africa were no different from the whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he devoted himself to what he believed in and didn't quite believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I very much enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to people. It helped me see that racism is not right and that everyone is alike, their fate should not be determined by the color of a person's skin. n
