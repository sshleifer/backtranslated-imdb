These films make no pretentious effort to hide their true genre - a campy B movie. It will flatly tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. It should also have given adjective the meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this movie in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" And then you laugh. For example, there is a scene back in the "17th century Japan" that shows a few samurai who are at the forefront of a temple. On the background of the temple, there are several tourists who look in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I couldn't stop laughing. And the play goes from decent to bearable, oh gentleman, but it makes fun. You will see some decent actors and then find others really awful. I have to buy something, even though I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several games and she's great. Her airtime in the movie was pretty short though. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits and he is also better at theater than in this movie. In any case, it is an entertaining movie if you have nothing to do on a weekday evening.
