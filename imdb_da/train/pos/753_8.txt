History of four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most head of the pile - but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) relies on drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new from what we have seen many times before - but this one has a big difference - it is accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first watched the film), and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothing and attitudes quite right. Even the biggest song in the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before this came out. This movie hit me harder than any other teen movie of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were like here! The film is (of course) dated, but it captures a time we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The action is good in every way with Foster, providing the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-appointed. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) plays more or less realistically a teenage girl. A very good movie - essential view if you came in the age of 1980. The movie has a deserved R rating (lots of drug use and swallowing) but should be seen by all teenagers. I give it a 8.
