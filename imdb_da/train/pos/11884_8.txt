I found this movie to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo announces the eldest that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members alone and with each other are touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family as physically demonstrating as this; nor one who is inclined to shout at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that the youngest couldn't handle the news, but once beyond that, I found this a thoroughly moving movie. <br /> <br />
