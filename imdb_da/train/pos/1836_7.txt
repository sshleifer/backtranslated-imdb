Time for a hit! Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Posted by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes ladies and gentlemen ?? in Vipul Shah's 'Waqt', we have probably found this year's first bona fide hit. Filling in with all the necessary ingredients in a commercial Bollywood fare, 'Waqt' has everything it takes for a movie to click with the Indian audience. It's the kind of movie that makes a distributor feel happy and consider his next phoren visit! In this 'saga of Indian feelings' we have a happy family (isn't it always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), postman-turned millionaire (don't ask how! ... there's something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that? Seriously - who gives a damn!), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a doting father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude to life's responsibility. His love for Aditya nevertheless results in his postponement of the serious problem. But when he faces a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that the new problem can make him more conscientious of his own life. But this supposed solution becomes a problem in itself, as the shift between the loving father-son increases, and the fence continues to grow. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunity to infect both comedy and drama. So the pre-interval you have the original fun, later annoying comedy track of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and the after-interval has gone for your clothes darkness between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati piece 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the film is based) does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid. The dialogues tend to be inconsistent at times. It doesn't help that songs act like acne on a teen's face and lose the procedure. Obviously, a few numbers could have been done away with. On the leading edge, Vipul shows that he has a natural flair for storytelling. 'Waqt', as well as his previous debut 'Aankhen', manages to keep you interested until the last wheel. On a personal note, the seesaw of emotions was a bit shaken for me. But the audience from the audience reactions it was working. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'Waqt' is about its performance, which corresponds to a whole point in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible and that is his age! Shefali is pitched in a finely sophisticated performance and matches the superstar at each stage. Boman and Rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics. Priyanka does not have much to do than to fulfill the role of helper help. When it all boils down, 'Waqt' is Akshay's vehicle. I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role suits him. Put him in a 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi', and he's great, but in a 'Bewafaa' he's terribly bad. Here, Akki is probably at its best. Whether it's his comic timing or his emotional reproductions, he's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for its fans! Ironically, his previous best effort in 'Aankhen' with the same director and Big B was by his side! ' Waqt 'is by no means a memorable movie. It is not one that will work in the best movies in our industry. But it's one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, 'Waqt' can just do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Band Character <br /> <br /> Trivia-This is Akshay Kumar's second consecutive movie after 'Bewafaa' where he performs on stage during climax! <br /> <br /> Rating *** <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
