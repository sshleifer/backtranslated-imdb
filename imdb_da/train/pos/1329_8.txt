I grew up in Brazil, and I used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the green coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from Rio de Janeiro city. <br /> <br /> This movie brings life to the world in the 16th century Brazil, where Europeans hardly began to explore the coast, which was still in pristine condition and sparsely populated by various native tribes. French and Portuguese fought each other for territory and even at Brazil's tree trade, which was constantly negotiating with the natives who also fought each other for some reason. <br /> <br /> A French misfit ("a mercenary") is left to die of his own compatriots, but manages to escape and is imprisoned by a completely naked native tribe. While he is a "slave" of the chief, he is, according to the tribe, allowed to live in relative comfort for months, until time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a rapture ritual. <Br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it recreates in loving details the native villages and their lifestyles (they went naked and were cannibals) and ask us to acknowledge and accept life in these times as it is was: in a beautiful garden of oath, life was cluttered, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and bizarre customs. Europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There is no romanticized "noble savager" or "heroic explorer" here, it's just people trying to survive in a tough world. The film is neither incredibly sympathetic nor dismissal of the natives. From what I know to the subject, the picture is quite accurate, which adds a clear air to the project: How many films have you seen with regard to Brazilian natives' lives and their early relationship with Europeans?
