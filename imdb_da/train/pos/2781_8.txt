This was a cute movie. A really good movie when you need one. The story is light (it's not Gone With the Wind), but sometimes you need this kind of plot. Quiet and warm figures, amazing plays and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is amazing in this role. She is definitely a new shining star to Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on her, she becomes BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> Also impressive was the soundtrack to this movie. A lovely mix of modern and Indian tunes. I danced through most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if a funny movie is what you need.
