"9/11", appreciated by Robert DeNiro, presents recordings from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. <br /> Never for pigs and gorys, yet powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. Anyone who has not moved this TV show is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 Stars - <br /> <br />
