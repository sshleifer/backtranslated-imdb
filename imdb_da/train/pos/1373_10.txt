This movie must be required viewing for all librarians or librarians. All the best lines are directly related to the librarian. The Public Library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument among librarians and library school students. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they don't * usually have sex in the Romance language section! (The best film about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
