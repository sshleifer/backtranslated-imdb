I actually found this movie 'interesting'; Finally a worth my time to see and rent. It is true ... some scenes were over the top of emotionalism, shouting, etc. But which movie does not emphasize its agenda, genre or 'ax to paint'? Almost none! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere made by a S.Fran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his "own" review of the movie; not by the movie at all. Anyone watching this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chasing, yes !! Being "in" an Italian family myself, I can fully relate to the environment depicted on the screen. The film also has its tear-effect parts. It's real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
