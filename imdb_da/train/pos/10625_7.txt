"One-minute hat" is undoubtedly one of the better movies to come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it is a brilliant movie in any way, but it is definitely worth a watch. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" chronicles Eric Seaver's sweden adventure (played by director Kallio), a formerly abused child who has now grown up and begins listening to her evil side. "Hat" is very nice visually. The shots are creative and the lighting is extremely mood and interesting to look at. This movie actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent Michigan releases like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies." Subtle Dolly Shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this movie $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> But "Hatred" stumbles in the same places as so many other local films do, and it's in the story and character section. Essentially, things just happen. Eric Seaver does not develop at all. Basically he has always been crazy, it's just that people start to notice it. The film just walks along its joyful way with very little development. The end is also very steep. <br /> <br /> But since this is a horror movie, since when do we care about plot? We just want to see people die, and "Hatred" surely delivers. When the body counts mounted, people in the theater began cheering "Kill her! Kill them!" When people scream back on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> It's the place where "Hat" succeeds. It is fun. And in the end it's all that really matters.
