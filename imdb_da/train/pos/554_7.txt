(includes small spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Of course, Stewart is remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" so it's easy to find parallels between the two movies. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. In "The Far Country", Stewart's Jeff Webster gets by not being involved in helping others (except himself), to look pretty much the same: A world where he (for all practicalities) doesn't exist. /> By not being involved (and by trying not to worry about anyone), Webster is forced to see them for whom he cannot help but care is being hurt, pushed around and even killed, while standing by doing nothing It reminds that George Bailey viewer sees a world that has turned upside down because he also decided not to get involved by not having been born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end up with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell. Stewart, by reversing his non-involvement philosophy, has apparently earned his "wings".
