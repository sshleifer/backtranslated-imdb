People of Honor Stars Cuba Gooding Jr., as Real Life Navy Diver Carl Brashear, who believed a man's Navy to become the first African-American marine diver. Sometimes by his side and sometimes his opponent there was a man whom Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His depiction here is so liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in the hurricane. Through every scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the fight in him as he begins to make his father proud. I also loved how the instructor created and produced a lot of tensions in some of the most important diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine under a mountain target is cardiac arrest and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I could see was in the support pile. Cuba and DeNiro's characters are very intricate and exciting to see. It makes you a little sad when they have to encounter heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric diving school Colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba's love interest are the characters I found to have much depth. What could have made these signs more comprehensive and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was it Colonel always in his tower? How did Sunday's wife come bitter and always full? <br /> <br /> Another curious question should be here. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I think if this movie is chronicling this man's life wouldn't his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Honor men, however, are a perfect example of triumph and belief that the human spirit encloses. This movie will inspire and make you feel like this man's battle. What I think was the reason why this strong story was told. My hat goes out to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
