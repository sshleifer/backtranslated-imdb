Loved it, but still has nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was well presented, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to the reality of writing. Many scenes seized the imagination and created a nail bit. The progression of situations was wisely written, which made me believe that the story was just one way to find a new twist on what I thought might be obvious. Too bad there must be commercial. I have told many friends to look for further exhibitions, and of course I will look again. I enjoyed the scene in the movie and felt this added to the plots and intrigue. Men and wife heated discussions (or should I say fighting?) Were very realistic. The original situation is a common one, but fortunately the escalation of the story presented is not. I would like to thank everyone involved in this amazing entertainment movie. Thank you! Looking forward to the next movies --- when? Whidbey
