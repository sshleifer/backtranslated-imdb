Kurosawa weaves a story that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespeare drama, and the play is true to the story, where each star plays their part as part of the larger narrative. It is touching, fun and exciting in all parts. The character development is almost perfect, the cinematography is vibrant and engaging, and the story draws you in. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that "Samurai freaks" and the 18th and 19th century dynasty stories in Japan can snub this movie as not Kurosawa's best work. Maybe not his best, but even at his worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is then based on raising the everyday lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless despite being in the not-so-distant past. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to any movie buff, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the movie is based.
