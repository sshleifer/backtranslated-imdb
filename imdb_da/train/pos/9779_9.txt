Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but somehow change. In the first story, our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who will find out what was happening on the cult. Something slow as history is told in flashbacks while the two are sitting on chairs and facing each other. Reporter is especially interested in what leads to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist in history. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> Another story has a fierce young criminal who visits a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy. The patient seems to have some sort of agenda, but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things go slow and become strange. Then there is a strange twist in history that is very well written and surprising. Finally, the story deals with spiritual healers who claim to be able to remove people's diseases from them with their hands. One of the patients is a former cult member, so the successful cure becomes more complicated. Again we are surprised by a twist. There is a beautiful gory scene in there. There is a lovely female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason. I found the stories very well written, and the director fully succeeds in creating each story with its surprising twist and gory deepening. <br /> <br /> Note: Review of the German DVD.
