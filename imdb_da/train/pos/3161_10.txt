In fact, I didn't start to see the show until it came to FX. I was bored and had nothing to see and saw that the show's reruns were premier so I decided to watch it. I was so sad that I had not seen the show since it was first sent on t.v. I loved the show so much! Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not fun enough. They wanted to make stupid jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not the 70's show. The 70-year-old show was fun, smart and so true. I think it was the best show ever made and I am very sorry it ended. Although I love this show, I think it should be completed in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. Last season was just not right, Eric was the protagonist and the show had to be completed when his character leaves. I still love this show, and I hope television will start making more shows like this one.
