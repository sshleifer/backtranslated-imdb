I'm looking at this site and it doesn't seem happy for me to listen to any crazy and ranting on a real classic. Well, I agree to let everyone get their opinion, but here are mine: <br /> <br /> This movie should not miss a classic horror watcher, and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. Of course, it has lost some of the flair and grandeur with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it's actually a scary movie, even to today's standards. It's overall ickyness will crawl as much as the original audiences, so don't drop a classic if you haven't given it a try. See it, but not with a critical attitude. Look at it to have fun how it was originally intended.
