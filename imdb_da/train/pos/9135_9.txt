I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rock! Excellent movie, has it all, good music (Prince of Rough!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad movie that moves a lot. I will not say much more, I must not renounce the plot, but I will say - the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many family members correspond to the one depicted in the movie. I see this as being very realistic and is so genuine, making the film much more moving. My generation loved this movie growing up, so many of us loved the prince and there is a lot to relate to for any teenager who has undergone similar problems. It's not just a movie for teenagers, Id recommend it to all age groups. And it's not that dark, the movie has some good music, tape performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
