This small set of film is a slender and retracted giallo. It weighs away from some of the clich√©s of the genre and adopts a looser approach. It's about a woman who is searching for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who suddenly disappeared without apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals. In true giallo style, murder is never far away. <br /> <br /> Cast is really pretty good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o'Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80s screaming queen). The leading actress is Rosemary Dexter, and while I'm not familiar with her, she does a good job of leading the picture. <br /> <br /> One of the basic features of Eye in Labyrinth is its music. Atypical for a giallo is a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, is reminiscent of Miles Davis, especially his work on In A Silent Way. It's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel to most gialli. The fusion trail highlights the sparse atmosphere and complements the sunny ocean view that the film consists of. <br /> <br /> This is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder. Well, this movie is a little short in this respect. It is certainly not devoid of them, but they are few and far between. The doorman's opening is probably the best offer and a memorable burning car sequence. But this is really not a particularly violent movie. Still, I don't think it should disappoint for many experienced fans of the genre. The mystique is quite convincing and it has enough eccentric characters (idiot boy Saro and the incredibly improperly doubled accent?) And the bizarre moments to satisfy; while the sleaze factor is maintained with a nudity of nudity throughout. <br /> <br /> The eye of the maze plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery, as it contains a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa, all suspected of murder We have the mandatory feedbacks indicating their connections with the last hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victims. While this is not a class-An example of the genre, it is certainly an appealing alternative, as it does not lock too heavily to other sub-genre films. For giallo enthusiasts, I give this a thumbs up and hope one day it gets a nice DVD transfer. It certainly deserves the treatment.
