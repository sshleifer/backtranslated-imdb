I can remember Casper comics, but don't remember any comics. Maybe they were not memorable; I don't know, but in my advanced age, here I see this very early Casper animated card yesterday. Then I was shocked to read the user comments here. Have people missed the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts who want to go out every night and scare c-p out of everyone. "He sees no future in it," according to the narrator here. Instead, he goes one night out to the countryside of the city, accidentally scaring some animals and can't find any friends. It brings him to tears until a little fox hears him bawling and turns to him. The two become friends, but soon the fox reaches out for his life with a fox hunt in progress. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have all mentioned what is happening, so I'll also touch it. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown), and Casper is in tears to lose "the only friend I have ever had." But no one mentions the happy end to this story. "Ferdie" fox becomes a spirit figure like Casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator's comments "they happily ever lived." Both characters look happy. <br /> <br /> What's so sorry? This is a lovely story with a good and good ending.
