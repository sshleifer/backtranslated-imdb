And comedy gem. Lots of laughs loud, shops and pub scenes had me wonderfully uncontrollable. The signs are recognizable and the dialogue respected - I know people like this! The humor is surprisingly gentle and the film (this sounds strange) puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy. It's a quirky little movie with lots of details. It certainly takes a number of views. I've seen it a couple of times (I've shown all my friends!) And feel something new every time - a little dialogue, something visual that I hadn't picked up before. I could get really picky and find a few flaws in the movie, but I don't get it because it is a really fun, emotional movie that is really worth watching and that anyone with a sense of humor should enjoy. It's a movie that finds its friends and I hope there are many of them out there. Oh .... and it has a good soundtrack.
