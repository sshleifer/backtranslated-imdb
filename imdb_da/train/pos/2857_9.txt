As part of our vocabulary from the late 1950s, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. on the big show "Bonanza." <br /> <br /> It came Saturday night and everyone was glued to the TV. This was a real show depicting family values. There could have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was dominant as the family's patriarch. His words depicted wisdom. We were often left to know that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best of men to the bad wife of his dead. He bred wonderful sons. Of course, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine, and Roberts surrendered a lot of money when he left. His career never went away when he was associated as a Cartwright son. He should have tried to get back in the series. He certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out.
