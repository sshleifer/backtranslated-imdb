I can't say that this movie deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol raised on it by some reviewers. Yes, it is skewed with an exaggerated upholstery, disturbed editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience through it without checking his or her watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some ridiculous, fun lines, a talented and serious cast and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi do outstanding work and add combat and variety to the team. I can't say that Reubens or Mitchell added much to the movie overall, but each had few chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The reason I said above is your classic "underdog-make-good" thing. No surprises there, because you know they have to win. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, frightening heroes and villains, but the dialogue and the interaction between the characters. In all, these people are children at heart who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the movie give this movie its emotional grounding. Look at Azara's relationship with her long-suffering mother; Macy's endearing innocence in his reluctance to accept Cap. Amazings secret identity; Stiller's rage (not unlike the one weird, spazzy child you once knew who would always go in gloomy, outrageous races on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of the superhero comics; and under its parodic look, "Mystery Men" shows us why these hackneyed comic-book troops matter to so many. <br /> <br /> It never sounds really good in a satisfying whole because of the large number of semi-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is so worn out fun that it makes up the. The fact that it should be good that it does not seem to be good seems to be lost in some reviewers here, so I give a warning: If you are the type of viewer who finds his pleasure in an itchy and itchy cartoon ruined by the inexplicable and illogical ("Do I believe this is a kind of .. * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone?") then you are too literal and humorous for this movie. Go clean a Sandler movie instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
