I am a fan of ART, I like something about art, I like paintings, sculptures etc. This film shows it so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman will paint all about art, especially naked bodies but she cannot do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not let her paint naked men because it is against moral. Yet Artemisia could paint his girlfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is in love with her too, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom to her by lying. He said he raped her, but it wasn't true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she will suffer much, because in the trial where Artemisia, her father and art teacher, was, someone injured his artistic hands to tell the truth. I think it's a great movie about ART, and an artistic love. It's worth seeing. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she works very well, I also like her performance in "Portrait of a lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
