I watched this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. This was before the television, so a movie of this size could send a young child into orbit. So I impressed that I went to watch this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects that were used at this time were far ahead of its time. Sabu was a real joy, like Rex Ingram was Geni. I found myself singing "I'll be a sailor" for months after the movie left town. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villain as someone you would ever have met. June Duprez was also never lovelier than she was in this picture. The color was excellent. Give this movie an AAA!
