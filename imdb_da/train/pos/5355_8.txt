Running Man is viciously interested in the modern American media complex and hits his target death center. It can be an easy target, but they still pull it off. RM is effortless to go on pro-wrestling (with some pro wrestlers like the hunters), network TV, Nielsen ratings, the US government (which is nevertheless entertainment-oriented), crime and punishment and half fifty other things along the way. It is far from the original Stephen King novella, and Arnold is not Ben Richards in the short story either. But who cares? It is basically an Arnie flick with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners that a business requires.
