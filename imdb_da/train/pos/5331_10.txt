just watched sky tv missed the first half an hour. I wondered if it was a true story, so it looked to the end. There were no cards at the end to say what happened to everyone. It reminded me of speed, but at the end of the day I do not assume that it was released at the cinema when we saw the following error. The yard we saw was that they removed the bonnet (hood) and then later there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to lower it when the engine is back on. It had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the child was to break the bridge and of course when the bridge was not to be lowered, and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears so it wasn't that bad !!!!
