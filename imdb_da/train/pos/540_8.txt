in fact ... that "video camera" effect is just that, it's an effect, a pretty good one. (You don't know much about controlling a movie do you?) This movie is actually better than the original, it's fun to watch, made for TV, doesn't have to follow any rules. I find it hard to see number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, it's disturbing. and all the time we drive for Judd Nelson to get away with what we as viewers are on his side. I hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this movie lets you understand how real movies are made as it is like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the most horrific villains ever, and he is more realistic, he does not just upset thoughtless people as in other horrors.
