Episode two in season one is a lovely holiday tale of love, fraud, ... and a murderous, escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas. A woman (mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime, begins a struggle to survive as a fake, Santa Claus suit wearing psychopaths (Larry Drake, perfect over the top) threatening her life ... as well as her precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered by even those who are relaxed about the program. That way, this particular reviewer looks at it every Christmas on routine. Most notable for this is escalating excitement and narrative phrases, and All Through The Houst is among the best of Tales from the Crypt.
