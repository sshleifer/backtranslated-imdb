Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear. They are all stalked and maliciously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran. "Tramp Infernal" is a beautiful entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". The movie is fast and there are some good death scenes like the neck or axes in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much going on, so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed. But if you're a fan of slasher movies, this rarity gives a look. Mexican horror flicks are pretty unclear (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher.My rating: 7 out of 10.Highly recommended.
