This movie was charming. An auditor wants more from life than the approved conventional success. What does it do so well and makes it so different from the standard dance film that it is not really about being "Great," it is simply about finding a way to express yourself. The great triumph at the end is not the winner of a competition, not the discovery of a whole new lifestyle but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one discovers their passion, they find their calm soul. The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and the "secret life" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in everyone.
