As much as I have enjoyed Hanzo the Razor movie, three are surely enough: "Who's Got The Gold?" The final adventure of the Japanese lawyer with the impressive package is a rather enjoyable piece of Pinku cinema, but offers little new in the form of ideas, while taking a big step backwards in terms of monstrosity. <br /> <br /> The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks like it will explore supernatural territory, something that could have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the ghost turns out to be other than a Scooby Doo style ruse (boiled up by a corrupt finance minister willing to keep people away from the lake where he hides stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is pleased to Reusing known elements from the first two movies is a rather horrible affair. Hanzo once again leads a study that requires him to interrogate women using his powerful penis, cut up his enemies and abuse his superiors. On the way we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (Hanzo forces himself to women who turn up to appreciate his will) and bloody sword fighting. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen and appreciated the first two movies, you might as well watch this episode to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably the least satisfying one of them all. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
