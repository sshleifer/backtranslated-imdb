The kids I took to this movie loved it (four children aged 9 to 12, they would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the title role. (Expect to see more of this next generation of Roberts in the future.) Having been equated with Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she was working streets. Also enjoyed watching a supportive casting that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a cameo by Bruce Willis). Final takeaway: Sweet movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I haven't read the book series so my comments are based on the movie's properties.)
