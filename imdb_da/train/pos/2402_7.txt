The main reason for watching this movie is Warren William, who is in top form as the cheerycampaign manager. He is electric, constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeating the counterpart in the midst of the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he never got his fault. Bette Davis as her boyfriend also shines in a signed role. Personally, I did not find Guy Kibbee quite right as the lame-brained candidate that William and the others are trying to foil on the public. He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person. I would have preferred to see a real character appearing rather than a non-character. The story itself is unreliable, silly and clich√©d. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth seeing.
