This is a sweet and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has driven to California to escape from a mistaken relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American manual worker with hopes of rock and roll star, but a little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken in order to be permanent in the United States, with the understanding that while they will live together until she gets a "green card", the marriage will only be named. It soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", and thus the film's title. As an immigration lawyer, I have seen such "events" on my own, so I was happy to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic opportunities for this situation.
