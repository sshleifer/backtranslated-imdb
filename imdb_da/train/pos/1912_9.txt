I keep it short and short, the people who wrote the lines of history for this show are genius, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is legendary), and they have so much chemistry on the screen, making it what It is a very successful comedy. When I first saw the new episodes that probably go back just over 6/7 months, I wondered what had happened to Paul. I was jaded to find out he was dead when I looked at Google. He was so funny and played his character to perfection, an over-protective father who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boys. The comedy I think has gone from strength to strength, even without Paul in it. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think most people would enjoy seeing it.
