At one end of the 80s, Warren Beatty and starred in the literary epic reds of the founding of the Soviet Union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical John Reed. It was a deep movie both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another form of epic in Dick Tracy, which does nothing to be anything but entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around, just having a good old time hamming it up under masses of makeup. br /> That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same person speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. In this movie, Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in an original manuscript. <br /> <br /> The city's top boy Big Boy Caprice makes a move to really eliminate competition. The movie opens with him rubbing Lips Manlis henchmen in a Valentine Massacre-style shooting and then Lips himself is mounted to a cement overcoat. But Caprice's movements make him a target for Tracy. Meanwhile, a third mysterious and faceless individual seeks to overthrow Caprice himself. Will ours completely sort out this evening's evening? <br /> <br /> The fun of this movie is really contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong is treacherously built to resemble the cartoon writers of strip writer Chester Gould and then indulge in the pursuit of carving the greatest slice of ham you must love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was nominated for Best Support Actor, but some of these guys might have, just because Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it just right, the others all seem to play him. Dick Tracy won the Oscars for Best Art & Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he himself could get someone like Sondheim to write a score for this film shows only that Sondheim wanted to get into the fun. As far as Madonna is concerned, the Material Girl has more than keeping herself with all of these valued heavyweights as club brand singer Breathless Mahoney. Before this film, Dick Tracy films were sent to the B-pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon series. The only thing competing with this all-star extravaganza is a radio broadcast to the Defense Radio during World War II that came to vinyl. Can you believe in a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews Sisters? Try and find a recording of that gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic big screen cartoon will do well.
