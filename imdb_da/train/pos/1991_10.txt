Yes, as incredible as it could be, in 1968 won a musical Oscar for Best Picture - and it was the third musical to win the prize for a five year period, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The Difference between my fair lady, the sound of music and olives! however, it is Oliver! is immensely better! No comparison. The first two films are incredible wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The action is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dance is amazing. This movie is dynamic, current, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York, Oliver! Offering a depiction of poverty in the 19th century in London, England, which evokes sympathy without being discouraging. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
