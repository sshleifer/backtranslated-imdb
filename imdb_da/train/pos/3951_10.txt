I've watched this movie only once on television and it hasn't been repeated. This is strange when you consider the nonsense that is repeated over and over again. Normally, horror movies are a pleasure for me, but this really scared me. DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT If you haven't seen the movie yet <br /> <br /> the weird bit is when the townspeople pursue the sermon where his wife is nearly dead (they had poisoned her). He asks who the hell are you anyway? One by one they give their true identities. The girl pretending to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him says, "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve".
