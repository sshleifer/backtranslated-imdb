Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into the extraordinary details and lengths of the film and its symbolism and judge it very highly. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a much-forgotten movie that seems to have been shot in almost no budget and quasi-documentary way. Pneumonic plague is loose in New Orleans streets and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to consider the main operator (Palance). The film is moody, shot in sharp black and white, and makes very good use of places. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals illness and illness equals crime) and just enjoy chase. It is not always easy to see a movie like this now, as we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early 1950s) and probably will not be of interest to the casual movie watcher. For those who want to see this for the first time, the big chase at the end is tight. It's something else, and honestly I don't know how they filmed anything of it. I can say it took so long to film the final as it did the first 90 percent of the film.
