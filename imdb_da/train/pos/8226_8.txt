We're talking about a low-cost movie, and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosive expert and a meaningless alcoholic); But generally the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are sympathetic, and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I like movies that surprise you with some people who are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ... I welcome this. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try also "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) a movie from Argentina.
