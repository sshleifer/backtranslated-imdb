Now I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Han's best movies. The reason, the fighting and the stuntwork are excellent. In this movie, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a criminal gentleman. After the crime was released due to lack of evidence, he hit Chan for the killing of a police officer. Because of this, he was wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the criminals secretary, went to a mall and began stealing the evidence of the crime of the Lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them on to Chan. However, the warlord knew that Salina had downloaded her incriminating data and hired her henchmen to capture her. Later, Chan appeared on the scenes and began fighting with all the henchmen, defeating them one by one. On the last scene, Chan was seen beating the crime master. Finally, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should see it. Highly recommended.
