I have seen this movie again to try to find out why it was not as successful (commercial or artistic) as it should have been, and discovered a significant artistic profit - which could ultimately have been its commercial extinction . /> <br /> First and foremost, this movie is trying "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than action adventure. There is action in it, but that is not exactly what it is about. If you focus on it, you will end up (as others have noticed) a bad "Aliens" clone. But again it is not so. <br /> <br /> The movie is really about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from human to near machine and back to man (mostly * back *). But because it does not attempt to give you a typical glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell should do this transformation without speaking, and virtually without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job - it can take two views to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is deficient and it is never sufficiently explained whether Todd's ability to hold himself against an army of seemingly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound humanity or what, but the film still makes a fantastic showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.
