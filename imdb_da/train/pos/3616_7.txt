Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a brilliant blow. She's perfect. Her inexperienced inexperience actually works in her favor. We have never seen her before, so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. However, this works against her because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against anyone fighting, we don't think she can beat. So, like a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> Again, it's not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films, "Girlfight" cheats classification or genre and stands alone as folklore, which can darn approach in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana does poorly at school. She beats people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father forces her little brother Tiny to learn how to cope so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives little money to his book sessions and gives Diana nothing like she doesn't need to defend herself or something worth doing for her life. Lille would like to go to the art school (cliche ', yuck), so he gives up to his boxing subsidy to Diana, who actually wants to cash. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who seeks to become a pro. From there, the story goes down to the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title game. <br /> <br /> What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's just a little too credible. Children with hard life grow up in difficult urban areas falling back on sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these conditions. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires is a game of boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal. <br /> <br /> Or there's another attitude to take: finally a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we normally see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions about people's lives and their feelings. The entire battle case is used as a platform from which to paint a larger image. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of some good work from a first-time instructor. The dialogue never rises over soap opera quality, but the story itself actually changed my attitude to some things. Yes, the world now seems like a better place. A movie did it. <br /> <br /> Degree: B-
