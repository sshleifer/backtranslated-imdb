This is a very, very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not drawn as elongated as he was later, and his voice is not quite right. In addition, chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is some bad sap that buys bugs from a pet store - there's no gun or desire from his side to blow up the rabbit for smiths! But despite this, it's still a very entertaining movie. The early bugs were certainly more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films he was messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they messed with the rabbit. But in this movie, he is much more like Daffy Duck from the late 30s and early 40s - a shake that just loves annoying others !! A true "anarchist" instead of the latter is fully drawn. Though this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it's probably fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much he's changed over the years.
