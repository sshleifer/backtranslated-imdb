I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with 'real' actors and scenery can't - even though the computer's effects are changing more and more. They can push the limits of the satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), acting ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', as when we see a modley herd of extinct mammals migrating across the countryside and chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to see as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the weird at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While the Ice Age is not as good as the best animated movies all the time, it's a really fun movie. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronism, the lovely backgrounds and the stomach. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred's grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth and Diego, a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, of course, they have a lot of problems. It is also Scrat, the most eerie rodent of history, who breeds an organic for the winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in ice cave. His opening scene is a classic. It is a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle, there are just a series of fun events with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the diaper-changing or dodos, are fun, the animals are sympathetic and it looks good out. There is also a quite touching moment when hollow paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so. <br /> 7/10
