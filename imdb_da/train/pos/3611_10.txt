I watched this movie after I saw Blue Crush and other Michael's films I thought she had a bleak future in this business. I was very wrong after seeing her performance in "Girlfight", I was amazed at how she captures the feelings of a giant, but also a warrior. In this film, she explains her father about the treatment of her and her brother, the way she communicates anger when he is hit. Her characters learn baskets in the film, she can't always make a wall and hide from love, or just because she has power, she doesn't want to win. I think this role was perfect for Michelle, although she had no previous experience, so the director's talent, I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
