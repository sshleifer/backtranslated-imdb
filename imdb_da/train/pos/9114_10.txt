Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea provides a multi-dimensional look at a community assigned to caps and dealers. But the fun is that this is not at all a focus or even the subject of the short. But it is the undisputed claim of independence from these themes that are most striking. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It's almost this departure, which first takes your eyes off, so seeing it twice is critical. The film has an aesthetic quality that gives its self to the true art in the cinema. <br /> <br /> And this is the true art, with an African voice that is extremely rare. The movie does not copy to achieve its message, it renews and provokes by drawing on subtle stereotypes (not racial but character based stereotypes). From an author's perspective, the film is brilliant. It carries multiplications that contain a very rapid character development. It should be remembered that this movie is less than 10 minutes, and it manages to establish character very quickly. The use of color texture and music is also to praise. But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture 500 years later, music can be expected. But from a point of view view, does the idea seem to be a departure, but the satire indirectly receives a social problem? Brilliant thing!
