This is one of the best reunion matches ever, with Adam West and Burt Ward parading themselves and having fun while doing so. It's the amazing amount of effort that went into the detail, especially recreating the feel of the 1960s era, Batcave sets, Wayne Manor, the costumes and actors chosen to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith , Cesar Romero, and frank gorshin! This 90 minutes is worth your time and is a pleasure for all fans of the classic 1960's "Batman" TV series. I notice that clips from "Batman" were from the movie, not the series itself, probably due to legal limitations. Let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD.
