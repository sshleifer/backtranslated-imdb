Although it was unfortunate to hit the festival circle here in Austin (SXSW Film), just as we got tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at the scene of "The Scottish Play" as actors call "Macbeth" when they produce it to avoid the curse, this is a sharp, effective, and stylish treat for the treachery that takes place in the squad. With a wonderful evocative score, and looking and hearing far better than its small budget will propose, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but quite satisfying.
