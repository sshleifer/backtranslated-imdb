You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, an American secret agent soldier hard guy, sent to uncover Nazi secrets and turn the tide of World War II. It means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to countering Hitler's war machine and even Fuhrer himself. This may be the most influential game of its time. That's because it literally inspired occupation. Many games existed at that time and even more do today, but so often you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Like Tetris before and recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world that led to one of gaming's greatest tidal waves being fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and other legions owe their existence to the boys at ID. Whether it is direct or in most cases indirect, but they still do. Even with the old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, game limits now on the "experience level") and very rectangular levels give the range of all six episodes lots of fun. Especially discover these secrets of treasure and a chaunun in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Halt!" * Bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never gets old. --- 8/10 <br /> Voluntarily characterized PC-13 for "deep carnage". But it is exceptionally tame compared to what games have today.
