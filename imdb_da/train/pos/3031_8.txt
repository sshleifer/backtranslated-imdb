It could have been better if it had been led by someone with more experience. Shumlin didn't do a bad job, but it's not a great work of film art. However, it is a beautiful movie. I've loved it when local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made by his novels and stories. (Many people love "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" once many years ago and liked it, but maybe I just think of the novel.) This is excellent cast. Charles Boyer is not true as Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, careful, caring. Lauren Bacall appeals to the British girl who falls for him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She comes across as an early early teenager. The sign will be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reservation is primarily that it is a little stolen. But the story and the play can hardly get any better.
