This is a great card. I think every voice is made of jason steele. (You can just say if you've heard his normal voice, don't worry about those who look the same. They don't.) It's about. 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Edward Spatula fights the war against spoons and he meets some weird people. In fact, everyone he knows seems quite crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "General Peterson, we must get you a medical unit!" "No, I'm not going to do that, Edward." "Don't talk like that, I'm sure you're fine." "I'm an Edward and you know it." before I go yes? "Can I just have ... a kiss?" "Umm, no." "Come on, just one, little, peck on the lips?" There will be movies soon, the date it is in September, but it will probably be pushed back.
