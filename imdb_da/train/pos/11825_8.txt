Don't look for an over-developed plotline here .... just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one. A gallery of stars emerges as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy featuring incredible makeup and set design, not to mention knockout performances from Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Fun for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
