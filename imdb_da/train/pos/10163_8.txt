This had a good story ... it had a good pace and all the characters were cool. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and it had to be the best I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> However, Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Although small, it was cleverly designed from the beginning. /> <br /> This can be a romantic comedy, and I don't like most, but the writing, the direction, the performance, the sound, overall designed in all capacities were just really tame sweet. <br /> <br /> This movie scored quite a lot out of all the movies I've seen lately - and the rest was big budget or better published. <br /> <br /> Good job writing.
