Lost is the best TV series there is. First of all, it has great actors and wonderful directing. The writing is a very controversial problem, because in the first two seasons the letter was extraordinary, but after season 3, writing was very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many believe that the authors are lost and that they have raised many questions and mysteries that they cannot explain. I think these people are wrong. I trust the authors. I think if the mysteries are revealed from now on, the whole charm of the series will be gone. Still, lost is undoubtedly the biggest television series and it will continue to last a long time.
