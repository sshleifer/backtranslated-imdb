I went to see it twice in this movie, a friend of mine went to see it in the publishing party, and he told me it was so good that I expected a lot about the movie because I couldn't enjoy it because I didn't see it in a nutshell. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time, I felt in the mood for a party. I LOVED the music, it's just amazing. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his instructor talent, he will be a director where everyone will talk about. If you can deliver this movie as your first, be talented. <br /> <br /> The action is made by some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of rising talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
