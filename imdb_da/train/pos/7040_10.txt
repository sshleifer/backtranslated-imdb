This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great backgrounds and sets. 2) It showed inequalities in a war-torn environment along with a technological one. 3) John Cusack's play was amazing. He portrayed anxiety very well. 4) It showed all people's vulnerabilities in a war-torn situation. 5) It gave us a picture of what could happen in the future in many respects. I was also impressed with the actor for the most part. Hilary's play was, I found the most stylish. The values ​​of morality and values ​​in a war-disrupted situation are in danger. The liberal journalist and conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are just unpredictable. Good cases. PSP
