Stan & Ollie become SAPS AT SEA when their friendly little boat is controlled by an evil murderer. <br /> <br /> The boys are wonderful in this feature, starting with one of their most hilarious pieces, the horn factory. Always a few steps without synchronization with the rest of Creation, Laurel & Hardy resident a world where icy radios and bedded billy goats are the rule, not the exception. With its short length, the film is more in style with their classic short topics that explain its episodic nature. Only those boys get screen credits, but the movie boss will recognize other well-known faces: James Finlayson appears as a loony doctor, Richard Cramer makes full justice to his bad guy role, sweet Mary Gordon plays the boys' confused neighbor. It is Charlie Hall as apartment house desk clerk and silence comic Ben Turpin depicts a most peculiar plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the film's screenwriters was silent comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie's main focus, though. Watching Hardy go crazy at the sound of a horn, or Laurel's antics with bananas, for example, remind the mouse why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants.
