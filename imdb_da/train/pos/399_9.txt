This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy films, you should love this. This film is the Asian Lord of the Rings: a high-level fantasy based on the actual Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this movie plot-less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this should be straight up your alley. This movie is still very difficult to find in the US, although it was purchased for US distribution along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Worth searching !!! This DVD is also worth owning.
