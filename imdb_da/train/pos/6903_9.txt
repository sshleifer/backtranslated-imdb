This little valued movie is one of my favorites. I can see it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! A heavy-in-kind, menacingly humorous Gomez Addams, with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this often told story. <br /> <br /> Generally, unexpectedly and unworthily, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out reality and participate in the fun of the screen. Two thumbs up!
