{Any spoilers come up ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of my most popular musicals and movie musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston). As we all know, sometimes the shine (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost in the transition from scene to screen. This is mostly not the case here. The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life, and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is amazing. (So ​​glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors "jump the ball" (that is, have an unmatched chemistry) to perfection in this movie. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York, and the most infamous gambler betting on even the smallest things - as his fever goes up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. Sweet, fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (though true, her song tube is not as excellent as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the mission top with a heart of gold and a drive to heal everything. And last but certainly not least (in my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, representing her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - Hot Box singer and dancer who would like to end her 14-year marriage with Nathan with marriage and release even the psychosomatic cold he has given her. <br /> <br /> First of all, Kudos to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley as they represent their Broadway roles as Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were never two more lovable gamblers than these guys. Brando is amazing as usual, and although he doesn't have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - as he has this sense of will to bring everything he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck being a lady" gives me chills every time I see him performing the number. Especially pleasant is to hear him say "Daddy ... I have cider in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons are charming and comfortable in a role suited to her appearance, voice and the way she wears herself. You long so dear to her not only to win Sky (or, unlike him, faith), but to help people overcome their games, drinks and other sins and live a life with God. Her rendering of "If I Was a Mountain" is fantastic, to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from Broadway cast never could (great actor, but chap was tone deaf ... go figure). I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... wish any guy would sing to me like that. Frankie is cool, slender survival across the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly, you want him married to Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And when you talk about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just pure perfection in this role. From accent to her belt out "Adelaide's Lament", she's just amazing. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you into Adelaide ... especially when she is crying just before and then again under "Sue Me". I still haven't decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I also like them. No matter what, she does great with them as well as "Take Back Your Mink." (I'm sorry they released "hollanderize" from the movie ...) She's definitely MARVELOUS, not to mention fun and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It is a mix of high class and street snake. Never use the "It's", "I'll" or "That's." It's always "It's", "I Want" and "It's." All in all, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals, and it is one that you should take time to see every time it comes. My only complaint? No "Marry the man today." Now it's a good song.
