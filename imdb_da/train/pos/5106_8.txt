I guess every time I see one of those old films from the 80s, it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how majestic they can work today. This movie is a good one. I remember seeing it as a young child and thought it was the biggest movie ever. It has all the heroic characters a young cowboy wants to be. Now as an adult I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I actually know what is going on. I found one thing weird. How many people can move to Houston and join Sissy, marry, move into a trailer, get one fall out, cheat, get an uncle die, then get back together, all in a month? Only in America.
