I just watched this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film, the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the film's presentation. <br /> <br /> All the keys aside, both my kids really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to rewrite many of the subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything away, but the bottom line is that this movie is so much better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially children's movies) out there. Bowl. <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" / original King of Masks that can / can make 12 stitches at a time. The actor in the film trained and learned to make up to 4 stitches at a time (then they would cut and switch to 4 new stitches).
