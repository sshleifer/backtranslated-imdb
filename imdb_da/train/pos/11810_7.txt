I liked it though. Warren Beatty is just fair as a cartoon hero. What saves this movie is the set, the incredible casting, and it removes a mediocre script. I really expected something bigger in terms of action or plot, but I got very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to see some of the greatest stars in Hollywood at that time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The one person who did a terrible job and didn't even belong to this movie was Madonna. She didn't belong in this movie, and her acting was pretty bad. The movie on some points just stood still. You expected something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad guy and he does it well. He and Beatty make an excellent good guy and bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a movie other than Isthar. I didn't see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. Things with this movie are that it's good, but it could have been so much better. I liked it as a kid because I thought it was cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is just fair, and with such efforts in the movie I would still expect a little better. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I thought the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a large-scale movie I just thought it could be finished with a little more of a bang. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only the 7 comic strips that make everything more excellent visually anyway. Costumes and makeup were also flawless. The facial makeup for the villains was great. Beatty just isn't up to such a greater than life character. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much more. It's me better than Batman, the other cartoon adaptation that came out close at the same time. Of course, the film was much larger compared to gross.
