I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally got a chance to see it late last night, and that was all I expected to be and more. That's the way a real horror movie should be. I think why it was so scary was because it was so realistic. The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out. It was very easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. The special effects were very good. I would love to see more horror movies like this one. This is easily one of my favorites. A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have put a good mood for this movie. Other than that, all the elements had a good scare film need. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that doesn't pull any strokes. I want to add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
