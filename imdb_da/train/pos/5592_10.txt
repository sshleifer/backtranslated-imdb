Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nudity, but it is so much more. In fact, this is one of the highlights of the cinematic poetry, up there with some of the 1930s semi-finished art cinema, in the same prestigious group as under the Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante roofs. It is almost a quiet, mostly based on its miraculous images, and also the stunning, symphonic score of Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of film and music, yes, and also with editing, direction, writing and action. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert in using motifs. Perhaps not as subtle as it could be, and maybe a little overused, but the appearance of objects like insects, lights and horses carries the story forward beautifully. The small snatches of dialogue are fortunately unintrusive. They do not poke as much as you could imagine. The final bit is weird, at least said. Reminds of Russian silence, we have a montage of workers. This is hardly sensible during the story, but it is so gorgeously made that I refuse to overpower the mistake. Ecstasy is a film that desperately needs rediscovery. It is one of the best films ever made.
