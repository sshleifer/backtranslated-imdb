I ran over this movie on the TV and couldn't turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely guy who falls for an extremely hot and sweet Goldie Hawn (who wouldn't?). The way Goldie's character retains from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today. This movie gave me a different angle in human relationships, and I also found it very fun. Peter Sellers' role was a difficult sell, but I think he pulls it out well.
