Ok - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks great in this movie - but in addition to his great looks, the movie is worn by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plot. From the start we are introduced to the three leading women of the film. A headmaster - very concerned about his image and never married. A police officer - with children and a bad ex to continue. The third - a power and status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's. <br /> <br /> They are almost "First Wives Club" and there is actually very oral bashing of ex involved as well as some "he left credit card" behavior. Character set - the movie continues. McDowell's character, the chief, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist completing the regular player (Doughty) gets hold of the eye. What will her two friends say about the following accident? Will they ever live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A tissue or two is recommended if you are the tear type - the end uplifting, but perhaps not what you would expect. All in all, a fantastic movie that stands out among the current choices of action, special effects and schlock horror.
