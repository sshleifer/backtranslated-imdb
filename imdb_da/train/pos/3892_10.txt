He is absolutely brilliant. But you need to be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. He covers (attacks?) All possible issues, such as. The first moon landing, Easter / Christmas, transvestitism, film and Mr Doktor Heimlich. <br /> <br /> For those of you brave to gang, this is not it is not for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, you should never see it here; You will feel foolish. <br /> <br /> By the way, I've seen his other stuff and even seen him perform live and this is by far his best work. He just shines. <br /> <br /> What can go as far as saying he's wonderful.
