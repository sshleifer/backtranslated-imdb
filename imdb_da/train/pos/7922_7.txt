In this release of horror movies, 50's Cold War Paranoia, Reagan-era America and high school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star's quarterback of Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania, and while he is in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the state, he cannot control his animalistic calls and continues to kill. Frustrated, he flies the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and re-enrolls in high school. He still cannot control his transformations, and the cities and his friends realize that he is not entirely human. Everything culminates in the school's big football match. <br /> <br /> I expected to be one of those 'so bad, it's good' movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was actually legitimate fun. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a pervive coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's lusty forms flame, Demond Wilson as the bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an odds doctor, all go out with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie, I was struck by how writing and humor were similar to 'Family Guy'. 'Full Moon High' has the same thing, everything goes tuning and never takes seriously.
