This was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed are thrown into this charming real-angels movie that helps the angels baseball team. You never know it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. He was fun. The story is about transforming your life when the child's belief in angels helped turn around anger, hardened, and cursed manager Glover looks the best in people. The film was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams. It was fun, charming, touching and sad, everything very nicely done. You will suffer (or love) it. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
