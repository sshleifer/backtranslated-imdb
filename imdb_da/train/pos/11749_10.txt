Finally, we get a TV series where we get to see the actor! Section 1 was excellent! The scripture gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still "I am not your father - I am your father and you are cheated on me!" bad, but the script made it possible for the actors to actually feel and live the right moments rather than show us what it would feel like so many soaps do. The camera's work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for several hours, but there were no unnecessary 'shots within shots or handheld camera crap' to add an "artistic" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /> <br /> Nothing was overstated or melodramatic, they were real people in a real place with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant. It was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when they get a real script, a real chance! Thanks Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew-wonderful work !! Please continue what you do, your efforts are greatly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
