This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of seeing it is in itself transformative to the viewer. Few movies themselves strive for this level of transcendence, and I can't think of any other movie - documentary or drama - that achieves it. There is no other movie where I both laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and accessible travel; On these issues alone, it's a valuable venture, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, living everyday, living. And it's a great, fun, adventurous story. That's why God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
