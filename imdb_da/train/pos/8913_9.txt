This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13, in 1957 and released next year. Then in 1970 I found myself the same county as a rookie PA state trooper. I've always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner as well, and he had a road sign in front that told all passing motorists that this was "home of the blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park, and it still shows movies today!
