Doctor Mordrid is one of the rare films that is completely under the radar, but is quite worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old series from the 30s and 40s. Therefore, I loved watching follow-up movies ... but judging by the rest of the Full Moon's production, there simply wasn't enough breasts to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary sacrifice scene, there are two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate because without it this could have been a Harry Potter-style magic party that the kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are good - I wasn't sure if Mrs Nipar hadn't walked an A-list picture on this movie, she was very credible. No seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the money to license Dr. Strange because I think it could have been a total kiddie phenom.
