This game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. Spider man has been framed by a mysterious cheat. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiosis like venom and carnage are seen everywhere in the city. Who's behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Now he seems to have turned a new leaf. Venom does not seem to be involved as he is just crossed out by the fact that Spider-Man apparently has cost him a pretty good picture opportunity. Well came from other heroes and lots of villains later spide the Spidey mystery. The battles are basic, not too hard to pick up, the battles with the bosses are quite fun. You are going to collect comics, you run out of the net, and it's a little fun to cross the city. However, it is also a weak point. The swinging is not that big, as all you do is swing through the city as Spider-Man apparently attaches his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-looping either specifically in relation to a say Spider-Man 2 movie video game. Still, it is quite badly fluctuating with the other elements, especially history. So be prepared to watch Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for a wild action packed trip.
