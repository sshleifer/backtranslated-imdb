Charming in every way, this movie is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good. If you love jazz music, it's a must see. If you enjoy seeing loving characters that make you smile, bring a tear to your eye and swing like there's no tomorrow, this movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed, it is best to stick to some of Darren Aronofsky (in other words, proofreader djjohn lights up, you don't know a good time when you see one!) My only complaint is that the movie was just for darn cards. I just have to see it several times to get my fill.
