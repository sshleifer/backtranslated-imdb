Permitted I had seen some "Speed ​​Racer", but I never really saw it, and I had also seen other shows that some with these characters dressed as birds flying a ship called Phoenix and another that Turned about a spaceship that looked like a huge ocean vessel and it flew back sometimes for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for anyone who might be five. This one, although I saw almost every episode and the amazing to me at the time, was that this show had some resolution to it. It actually ended, the evil did in contrast to almost all American comics, where nothing really concludes as the last episode of the generation Transformers ending with Galvatron and this new bad guy who vowed to get Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never Make it home with GI Joe with Cobra out there out there trying to try again and so on and so on. This ended and had a pretty cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a little bland at first, as it couldn't fly and only had a couple of really cool weapons. As it happened, he got a cool shooter like the one Android 16 that was used against Cell in Dragonball Z, and that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. Then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a pretty fun named Bobo in America. The villains did not just consist of Dr. Hell, but a really weird person who was half-man half-wife and a guy with a flying head. Interesting show, and it was nice to see a conclusion.
