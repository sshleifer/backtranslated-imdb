Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting movies. I was more of a movie then doing. I now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home instead of going to the theater. I also saw this short film "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been searching for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your site. Thanks ........ I am surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a Disney image. I also don't remember Disney movies. I didn't even remember that it was an opening movie for Disney. I really want them to show this on television sometime. I wonder if Disey has the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
