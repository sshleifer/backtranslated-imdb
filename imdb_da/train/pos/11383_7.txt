This is a fine musical with a timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a lovely 'Parisien' atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in the form of a story. Well, it's not really there. Or at least not really well prepared. The action is also not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues, I liked the scene at the Seine, I liked the character of Levant, the colors; and the dance of course, which is absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems to me.
