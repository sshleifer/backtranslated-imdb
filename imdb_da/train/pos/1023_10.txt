This show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years. Unfortunately, I will miss it. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a little. <br /> <br /> The last ever episode of SG1 (on TV anyway) was beautifully done. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if he were trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (Everyone works closely together for such a long time there are tied up and downs, but over the years they have become a family). I thought this was a great way to end despite the criticism of others. SG1 was something special and time and time again it took me over thresholds and astonishment. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode 1 I was connected. The mix of action, science, drama and especially comedy has worked so well that I want to have more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show means to me. I can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It has inspired me to do many things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the movie next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I will never have the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
