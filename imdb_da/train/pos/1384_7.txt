Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls as they fight their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace, and it works very well. It gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and become something related to them. <br /> <br /> Using a small throw gives extra pressure to the people as they all have a little more screen time than normal, but the people playing in this movie handle it well. Everyone is completely trustworthy. The visual setting is great, especially the underwater shoots in the swimming pool give a good effect. <br /> <br /> However, many films are made on the same subject, and it doesn't really matter to any of them. It pulls some "standard" printing methods out of the high hat and acts on them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's not good either, and I feel it could have done better if it had taken some less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
