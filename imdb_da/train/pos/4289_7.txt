I must be 100% honest with your IMDb colleagues. I wanted to watch the movie for a very long time only because of the poster. Isn't Charlotte Gainsbourg looking extremely sexy and charming smiling that way? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This movie will deliver expectations to those who enjoy all sorts of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> While I do not agree with another IMDb user who says the movie is overstated; I have to admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has lots of errors. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the lack of screen chemistry between the main characters. There is not a single scene ahead of the climax that shows the protagonists who share a moment of "romance" or even a clue to assuming they are interested in one another. Only scene was both a moment is hugely awkward (when both are on the couch) and not helping the audience understand about a possible love interest. I didn't buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> The movie still delivers very fun moments and has a strong dialogue that supports such an obscene premise. I mean with contempt that it would be very difficult to perform such a farce of a 43-year-old man these days. I understand it's a movie, and so I accept it as a fun situation. Plus, humor is versatile. There are moments with S&M, fun lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, fun situations involving family women and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she is by no means looking at movies. She is fun, sexy, looks very thin and fine, and shows that she is a versatile and talented actress who can draw a comical and dramatic performance in sheer sheen. Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the support supports do what they can. <br /> <br /> The score, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the movie. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be happy after the end credits. It is a good example of a good cinema.
