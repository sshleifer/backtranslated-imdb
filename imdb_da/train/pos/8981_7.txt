Dig! I would say to anyone, even if you don't like Metallica to see 'a kind of monster', it's a documentary about spinal wallpaper about one of the world's largest bands that act as mental children during a breakdown of the slag. It's fun and fascinating. Along the same lines you come! A movie about 'Dandy Warhols' and 'The Brian Jonestown Massacre' two Portland bands starting a kind of music scene at home, just because one of the tapes is getting big and one falls by the way into musical history books. Right from the start, the two bands in opposite directions only draw on their ability to make decisions, whether good or bad. Filmed over seven years and sometimes painful to see we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to the vodaphone advertisement!) And the Jonestown seminar falls from stage initiators to bickering wannabes. As the tapes become more dissimilar, the friendships are stretched tense and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage games. All this is half fun and half tragic and believes in it or not, is perverted to see. As I said at the beginning, you can see the Metallica movie, even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! on the other hand, is a little different and is more fun and much easier to see if you have a passing interest in both bands. Still a good movie and more a testament not to be in a band than to encourage it as a career path. Dig! Is a wild ride on rock and roll coat coats and a good example of the pitfalls and pleasures to be or will be famous.
