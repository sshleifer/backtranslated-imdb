Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and exhilarating, and at the same time so rewarding in feeling and joy. The story is simple and the theme of old and new clashes is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters, and the actors portrayed them. <br /> <br /> The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's pre-expansion days. He runs a bathhouse in an old neighborhood. Every scene in the bathhouse is a source of destiny for us stressed, unhappy people. Not even hardening cynics can find fault in this wonderful setting. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, combined with his modern brother. The interaction between these three people and the various visitors to the bathhouse is incredibly detailed and heart felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion, it is more than almost everything seen in movies. With his regime critical message, this film was not only censored, but also given unreasonably little coverage. It may be random, but when a movie of this caliber is almost impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can't help getting suspicious. <br /> <br /> So help freedom of speech and movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there is even one, share that share!
