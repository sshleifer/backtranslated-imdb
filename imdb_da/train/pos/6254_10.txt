I just watched this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The work title was 'Dog Days'. The audience reaction was mixed. Some people found the graphic gender and the realistic violence to be too much for them. Others really seemed to appreciate how good this movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not too weak in the heart. It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is animal poisoning, a streak tease from an elderly, an orgy 'bath' bathhouse in a shopping mall, anal light penetration, and the malformation of the mentally incompetent. <br /> <br /> If any of this sounds like too much to handle, this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The relationship with our existence is pushed into our face with utmost joy. Seidl has no interest in releasing humanity here. And why should he? This movie has excellent performances from everyone involved, is always interesting, and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film for a while.
