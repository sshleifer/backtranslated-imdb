Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie. She has a great talent for accents and she shows incredible skill in this movie in general. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She was also realistically played. She became frightening, upset and uncomfortable as the media, and the government continued their unsustainable witch hunt. I didn't expect much from the movie initially, but I was really interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neill was also excellent; This is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really seen him in other movies (The Piano, for example). I gave the movie a 7, but if I could only judge the play, I would give it a 9.5 and a perfect 10 to Streep.
