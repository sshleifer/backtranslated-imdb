I first saw this movie when it was released in the United States in 1984. I have seen it many, many times since. What strikes me about the film is the inclusion of art in the rehearsal of the characters' and visa's life. Throughout the film, the two are mixed together and at times you are never quite sure whether you look at the characters' life or a scene from an exercise. This continues up to the climax of the film. All these years later, my friends and I still love to discuss whether "Carmen" is really stacked at the end. From the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of the play, the love of art and the sharpness of the performances all combine to create a fantastic film that in turn mixes and twists the line between life and art.
