Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow followers (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. Scripture is good. Very down to earth and realistic with tone in the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do, rather than Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Even with that, Kiera Knightley provides a tremendous performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this achievement. Mickey Rourke follows up with his Oscar-worthy performance in 'Sin City' with another tough guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing but speak Spanish every time and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi provides a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she surprised me on a particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie, however, is the direction. Tony Scott's quick style brings the movie to life. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. It takes a regular film and puts on acid. All blacks are harder, the whites are lighter, and it has a kind of green glow to it. The action scenes are exciting. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
