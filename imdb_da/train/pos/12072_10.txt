What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy were to come together in a relaxing evening of relativity? <br /> <br /> This lovely novel clef never uses the actual names of the characters so thinly veiled and scathingly exposes not only to the people they may have been, but also to what they came to represent over time. If you are confused by allegory, or if you like your movies made up and mush, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Currently removing the strict avoidance of using the right names for the characters, we see Einstein delivering a pacifist speech to a UN hell for Nukes, being visited by Marylin Monroe after having filmed the infamous Seven Year Itch scene, as some say, led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio. They have a nice interplay where Einstein stumbles with appropriate professorial clumsy about the innocence of perhaps the greatest gender symbol in modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who believes that Einstein is a red. He is determined to extract Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Activities Committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person, may not completely cast as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become her lover, although Marylin will only show Einstein that she understands Special Relativity Theory. <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears as they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks. These are the weaknesses that ultimately lend humanity numbers, we cannot help but look almost exclusively abstract today. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the statement about the film becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Negotiation is one of my top five movies all the time. It's fantastic.
