In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the two other films by Jafar Panahi that I have seen, the director reminds my amounts of depth in subjects that appear on the surface, small. In Offside, Panahi's seriocomic tribute to Iranian women stands up for their rights, I don't think he's so successful. Not what he says is not important, of course (and it's too bad that just like any other Panahi movie, Iranians can't see it). But after a while, the film feels a bit flat and feels long even in 90 minutes. Not to say I didn't like it. The actors are all amazing, and the celebration at the end of the movie is contagious. But that is not an important work, in my opinion.
