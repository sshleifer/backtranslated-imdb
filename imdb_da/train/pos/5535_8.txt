The very first picture of the movie shows a mountain ridge in the early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: "This is almost too beautiful." And it continues like this: Pictures of landscape and animals that resemble a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girls' room, their father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This could seem outdated and escapist, but it fits in with a story of silent beauty that goes on between the boundaries between life and adventure between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme parsimony of the movie, which has a simple, slow story, only an actor and hardly any special effects, exerted a strong magic. Therefore, I find it regrettable that this parsimon has been abandoned in the last few minutes, when suddenly two additional players are introduced (the girl as an adult woman and her son). Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I couldn't bring an English pop song along with French mountainousness. I went to the movie with my two little daughters, but I also recommend it to adults as they appreciate this kind of movie. Clearly, not everyone does.
