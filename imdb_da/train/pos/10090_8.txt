I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was happy to find a fast pace, an underlying moral, excellent depiction of all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, excitement and beautiful filmography - even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor on her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before giving in to those gaspy hysterics who felt her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I wonder who trained all the elephants. <br /> <br /> When you talk about the stone Buddha sequence, you can really see that it is Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is separated from Taylor's. The only thing that breaks with that sequence is the poorly finished process shots, where the background moves much too quickly to horses on a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a thoughtful movie that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
