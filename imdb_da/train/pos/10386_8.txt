what is wrong with you people, if you were not blown away by the action car's sequences and jessica simpsons warm body then you are strongly screwed in the head. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I don't think it was aiming. It was fun and fun, I never saw the show when I was younger, I saw only one episode recently, and when I saw the movie, I felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats almost shook and the car sequences were good because it didn't bother me and pulled out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica simpson is simply, i just wished they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, I had a hell of time watching this and I would go see it again soon and I will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
