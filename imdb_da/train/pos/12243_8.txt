Kate Beckinsale is as good as not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, though I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the second Emma version. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, though. And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie better too ... she was more credible sweet and sentimental. There are certain things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, but how the humorous side is more evident.
