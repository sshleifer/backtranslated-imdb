Growing up in NYC in the late 80s / early 90's club scene, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover this place during this time period. No Madonna came up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but that was where she got it from! Instead of violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights, it allowed people to "fight" within the confines of everything that was not in contact with each other (which would justify an automatic disqualification). Seeing these kinds of extraordinarily talented / well-organized "throw-downs" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular, and all the big names from back in the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all reminded in similar pieces like Malcom McLaren sang "Deep in Vogue" ... it was no matter who you were or where you were from as you walked through these doors in this "magic kingdom" of a kind you became part of something bigger than yourself / you were important / and most important of all, the creation of your own movements and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become king (or queen) as it may have been. The words and whites were as sharp as the movements on the floor. All the tensions, excitement and magic of the very urban NYC energy are recorded in this movie. BRILLIANT!!! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD FOR THE WORLD TO SEE !!! Thank you!
