Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes selected by the Master to fight crime worldwide. The show was fun to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Run jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game. The action was fascinating and wisely created. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me closer to the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but substantiated in subtitle. Hopefully, someday there will be no way to see Rovers in action again.
