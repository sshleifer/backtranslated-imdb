Sentinel I hoped would be a good movie and boy I was right. A great story first and foremost from a novel, and I thought it was an original story, but I think it wasn't, and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good, and Keither Sutherland is also, but it is very difficult to push him from his role as Jack Bauer in 24 but ultimately you do it and he is very different in The Sentinel than he is in 24 anyway another person is trying to shake up their television role but failed. Eva Longeria. She was not so good in the film and had a back seat throughout the case. After I watched the movie I had constant dreams about The Sentinel and couldn't sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
