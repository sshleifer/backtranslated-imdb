Yes, I can remember this! Many years ago I actually looked at it. The story was totally surreal, yet amazing! What anyone who assesses and judges films should keep in mind is what the respective movie is aiming for. It is the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Certain films - like this one - aim only at ordinary and comical nonsense. Such films cannot be judged from a hypercritical proofing perspective. Of course, these films lack quality, lack a sophisticated story that often lacks first-class plays, but if they meet their primary premise - that's okay. I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was fun, had some very funny sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is still a smart actor.
