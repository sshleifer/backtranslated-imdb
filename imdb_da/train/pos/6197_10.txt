Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a finished puzzle. It has all pieces of acting, direction, storyline and entertainment value. They all fit together, and when they are finished, you create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a single mother, Fay Grim trying to raise her son not to grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and walked away. Soon, CIA Fay is desperately trying to find 8 journals by her husband Henry's. These journals were filled with confessions from his long past in the CIA and his engagement with countries and their governments. Fay was sent to find these magazines instead of releasing her brother from prison and being sent in a cat-and-wall hunt across Europe to restore these magazines and learn from her spouse's hidden secrets past she never knew about. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked after seeing her in OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought liveliness to these two comic roles of her, but Fay Grim was a far different role than the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her I had messed with her and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she is on the screen, and when she's off, you can't stop thinking about what's happening to her. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen other former works by writer / director Hal Hartley but I think I'm going to look at some of his previous films if they are half as good as Fay Grim was . <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie selection the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD, I'd like to encourage you to choose Fay Grim. If you have a common sense of how a movie should be, you will enjoy this movie immensely.
