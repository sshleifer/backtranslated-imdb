Moonwalker is probably not the movie to see if you're not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and enjoyed the bulk of the movie, the end wasn't great, but the first 50 minutes were there - if you're a fan. Personally, I think the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. The dance in each video is great, the music great to listen to and the dialogue entertaining. <br /> <br /> It contains many of his finest videos from Bad and snippets from his previous videos. It also includes live concert recordings. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must if you're not a fan / don't like Michael Jackson, steer clear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
