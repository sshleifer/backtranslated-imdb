Like the Arabian evenings, this film plays with storytelling conventions to make us feel that there is plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what seems to be a blind framework that tells the story of its life and so falls into a flashback that leads us right up to the blind man's present, where we find that about half of the story has not yet come. (It must be admitted that the second half does not fully live up to the first promise). Like the Arabian evenings, it tries to get as many Middle Eastern folk motives as possible in one work. A released genius, a beautiful princess, a flying blanket, amazing mechanical toys, cruises, a crowded marketplace, an evil vizier, jewels ... I don't know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in Persian way.
