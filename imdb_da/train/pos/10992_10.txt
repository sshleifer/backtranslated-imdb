Damn, I've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I'm still not bored. <br /> <br /> The pictures are so good and together with the music, which is amazing and perfect fit The CGIs are pretty bad IMHO, but the whole pictures with the black and white feel about it and the completely sterile interior were just ... Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. The whole feeling of feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> But even though the movie had minor errors, such as sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too "slow" but i dont mean the scenic parts of it i loved them completely. Also I was distracted very often by the very complex story, as when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps, where all their data is stored and has this conversation with the guy in there ... but it can also be me: D And the end could have been shown somehow more emphasized, they should have made the recurring-real memory part a little longer and "higher", but then again without all these errors the movie would have been so good that I would never stop see it again and again. .
