This PM Entertainment production is twisted with enough bullets to make John Woo say, "Enough already!" Of course, it is almost not as beautiful as Woo can deliver, but it will be the exploiting job in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover policeman in the near future. When his wife is framed to murder the governor of a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it's up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson is going to draw Van Damme's duty when he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car gates, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shooting outs. I especially liked the van that topples in midair before it comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite piece involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in the Don's simulator. It is only a chance to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
