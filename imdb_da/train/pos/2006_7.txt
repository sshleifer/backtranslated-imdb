At this point, it seems almost unnecessary to say that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a solid, strong and hassle-free performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor has previously been established by his critical recognition achieved in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But if anyone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can act well and it will be expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who belts out hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't generally watch a horror movie. I have come to expect that they focus on sensationalist rather than dialogue and plot. What I liked most about this movie was that there was really a profitable plot that was moved together. Gore is not as much as becoming the focus of the movie and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of movies with higher technical power budgets. So good fans may be disappointed, but the fans of history will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571, where the dialogue takes the back seat to bombast, we get a chance to know "the good guys" and actually worry about what's happening to them. Some scenes are inexplicable (like Derek's hallucinations), but you get the feeling that some aspects were as they should lay the foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this movie, this sequel will never happen. These few cases are forgivable to know that vampires could have been a continuous series. Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. Is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? Yes. It will not leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it will not leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. If you're somewhere in between the scare generator and the scarecrow's lover, this movie is for you. It reaches a good medium with the effects and history that balance each other. <br /> <br />
