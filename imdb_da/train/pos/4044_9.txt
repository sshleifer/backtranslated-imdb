I found this movie to be very paced. The principle is quite imaginative, and as a viewer I was drawn together as the characters evolved. The stimulation is very good for those who seem to think - probably kept hidden from viewer early, and the questions still arise which are later answered and produce a well thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebral and from an action point of view. It seems that some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster with this movie - one of them coming out of the gate. This would be more analogous to one of those coasters who first slowly take you up the hill - creating a wonderful sense of expectation - and in the end, I think is more satisfying for the foundation originally laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
