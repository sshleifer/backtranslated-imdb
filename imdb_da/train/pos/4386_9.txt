This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it hard for me to understand a lot and it ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on it, but then bought the DVD, used the English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this movie and discovered how good it was. It's great. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful window scenes, and the story reminded me of Braveheart, an engaging tale of good-to-evil. Here is Liam Neeson (well) vs Tim Roth (evil). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors come across as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want this guy in his arrogant, annoying kiss. (He is so wild and wild, the sick critics love his character more than anyone else is here). Neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female leader. The movie pulls you in and gets you totally involved, so ready to have an emotional experience that sees this.
