I never trust anyone's opinions about a movie. This also applies to critics. Sure, if it gets positive reviews, it's ok and a plus, but most movies that get critical rave, I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining movie. It takes you out of your life for a few hours and into a fictional character ... that's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, as she was in the first. Anyone who says she's horrible in this movie must have felt the same in the first b / c she's left in the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is her and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are big, like in the first. Who can forget in the first movie when she tells the police, "If you want to arrest me do it ... otherwise get f ** k from here!" Amazing scene and believe me she does it again in this. I was imprisoned by her. Her clothes, the way she smoked on her cigarettes, believe me it's worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I can't wait for this movie to be released on DVD, rude, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are plenty of terms, as in the first, including the end!
