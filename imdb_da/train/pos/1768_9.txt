I haven't been laughing hard at a movie for a long time. I had to go to an advance screening and was thrilled that I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout the movie. The audience all shared my laughter and patted and shouted through most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Steve Carrell (who I already had a fan of). In this film he proves his wonderful talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God, there wasn't a como from Will Ferrell (love him, but saw him too much this summer). There were parts of comic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed daughter with the "obvious problem" were quite hysterical. I will definitely go see the "40 year old virgin" when released. My advice: go to see it for big laughs and an incredibly fun movie on top of it.
