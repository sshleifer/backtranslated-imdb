Being Honest With You I think everything was so good in this movie that there was no reason why it didn't go into theaters. The deaths of the movie are awesome, for example, are awesome when used. There are a few dull moments when the story follows the little girl, but all in all it was a very good movie, which I hope one day will be props it should. The very first part of the movie is probably why it came directly to video with them killing a little boy, but after that story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the mothers boyfriend who moved out to try to become an author. The property he buys turns out to be where the witch (tooth foot) lives, and anyone living in her house or continuing her property will be in great danger, you will not give anything really away just a little info if you wanted to see this movie so do it, it's worth the price of the rent
