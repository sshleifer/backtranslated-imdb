"I like cheap perfume better, it doesn't last long ..." - Ralph Meeker's judging character (Lawson) tells this to Barbara Stanwick's Helen character after he has got a perfume from the perfume she picked out with his husband in Tijuana ...! This line blew me and also seemed like a metaphor for this movie - the cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a 2x4 way is a better man to have around in the long run ! I agree with some of the other comments written about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Although her story says she wants Lawson turned away, she apparently is attracted to her burning nature, and the passion he shook her would probably not be washed with the tide!
