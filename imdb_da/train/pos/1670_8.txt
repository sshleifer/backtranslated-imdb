Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels, this show was definitely a cheeky one. The speaker of this sometimes gross adult chat show, Four-time BAFTA winner and British Comedy Award winning (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this. It had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. They had basically an adult idea that would either gross, humble or humor the guest, but some are not too weak hearted. They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their dicks to play a xylophone, women weighing up in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts and many more brutal but fun ideas. This is for adults only, but enjoy it! It won BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), it won the British Comedy Awards for the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show, it won an Emmy for episode # 18 (?), And it won the National Television Awards twice for Most Popular Talk Show. It was number 52 on the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
