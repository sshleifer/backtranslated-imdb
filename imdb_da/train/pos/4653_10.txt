This is a rip-roaring British comedy movie and one that I could see again and again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never done a bad role, and it is no exception, especially with his dry but very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been an admirer for me since he starred in 'Streets of San Francisco'. I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie, but seems to be so unlucky about everything she tries to do, but truly is so lit up, especially at the end when she informs everyone that she Have invested so much money that she has discovered while making his clothes. One thing concerns myself, can anyone tell me why I can't buy this in either DVD or VHS format in the UK, can anyone please help?
