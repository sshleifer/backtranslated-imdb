I really liked this movie when it was released and I still do it because the story makes you feel like hope in life in general and also people ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's movie. In addition to the positive vibes from the movie, there are other reasons to like the Grand Canyon. First, it has an excellent cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for Best Picture, is much like the movie. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose the Grand Canyon over Crash some day.
