I think this is the most powerful movie that HBO Pictures has made to date. This movie should have been released in public theaters to watch the big screen. It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a good job with the direction and manuscript. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.
