Most movies around or tuned in New Orleans turn out to be ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (investigate: remember "the Savage Bees"? But I will make an exception for "Tightrope" who almost got it right). <br /> <br /> Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. The centers are not too bad (yes, "yat" accent down here is much more Brooklyn than southern), the city of 1950 is shown as it was / was without the mandatory "tourist" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a "quirky southerner". <br /> <br /> One of the few movies to do justice to this city and a good movie to start ..
