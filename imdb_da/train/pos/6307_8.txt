I had never heard of this flick despite the connection to George Clooney (whose company produced and he looks like a very fun little bit) and his Ocean's 11 director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we picked this up in a $ 4.99 discount box (Canadian dollars on it!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I believe that if William H. Macy is in it, you can't be disappointed. This is very similar to the Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more godliness. This is an oddball and sometimes gut-splittingly fun movie. The real heist made me laugh so hard that I was crying. Perhaps the funniest use of underwear in film history. Perhaps it was the low expectations I had entered, but I saw with a group of people and we had a blast. Best $ 5 I've spent in ages.
