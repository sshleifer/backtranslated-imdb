(You know what I mean after you've seen Red Eyes ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, the Red Eye was a better than expected thriller. It starts with a slow start and slowly develops. But when it was over, it's a dump! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to accurately define what makes this thriller as ... exciting as I found it. Apart from that, the director simply put a worthy job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a driving license. I usually forget that I saw a movie. It says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors I think are "closeness" to victims and bad guys ... and over time you really start to relate to the victim. One scans 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but it's pretty good!
