Picked the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks, certainly got my money's worth! Could worry about the hot babes, but the animation just blew me away for a stable diet of the Simpsons (sorry Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend several views with some great tunes, good friends and a few cold ones!
