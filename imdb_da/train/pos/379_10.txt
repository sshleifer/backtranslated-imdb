1985 was a good year for film - maybe even great - but one lacked a gong went far to convincing fans that ol 'Oscar is a bit more like a hoodie for good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: such was the Academy's contempt for one of their greatest directors; and someone who had to wait 8 years before whatever prejudice had prevented them from giving him the statue before allowing him to give him 7 for Schindler's list, which is probably not so good (and I'm half Polish). <br /> Don't make me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I don't beat 'Out of Africa' (who won that year) either; but it was, in my opinion, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big messenger. Maybe it was the music (fantastic), or the cinematography (lavish), but more likely, simply the actor: Whoopi, who showed us all that she was much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before; and of course oprah. <br /> <br /> the rest is history; but at that time: who knew that?
