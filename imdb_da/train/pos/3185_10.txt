love story ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to an almost wet movie), even though it was funny enough. not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing something important. maybe a fifty version of when harry met sally? Ahab no, not really, but if it is in your top ten as it is mine, you will like this movie. really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, reminds you which romance could and should be, something to shoot for. my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
