I have no idea how a Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actor Gwyneth Paltrow has ever pulled this out, but to see it again will remind you what all the bustle of Mrs. Paltrow was in the first place! I was a long time away from the woman and still feel that she is quite boring in her Oscar-winning "Shakespeare In Love" performance, but she gets all the battles right here - she is almost perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but she must be remembered for this. Of course, she is surrounded by a large support console, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al. their relationship); For several years, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than in 96, and I personally find Puckish Alan Cumming a grid presence in something today. But standby is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles Miss Bates when she is drawn to whose fate we are drawn. The movie is worth seeing (again though) for her performance alone. All in all, this age has wonderful charms to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort the British class system. Well worth a rental (because it is unlikely that Paltrow will ever be so good again - but we always have Emma).
