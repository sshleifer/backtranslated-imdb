A warm, moving film that has a fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> As always, Ellen Burstyn is super. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many good performances, but there is just something about this being haunting your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you have to see this amazing 5 year old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could see her again and again. She is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was fascinated by this young actress.
