I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think everyone who saw it before they saw the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. It did a lot of the fact that the film was "by the Cube director" and made it look like a horror movie, as it is actually an absurd comedy (IMDB spelling doesn't seem to believe that Absurdist is a word but it is) reminiscent of Rosencrantz and the Guilder artist are dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way history builds up slowly first, then gradually escalating. I also enjoy the fact that there is no explanation of what happens in the movie. It and the fact that the story is played mainly in just one set are the only aspects in which this movie resembles Cube. I recommend it.
