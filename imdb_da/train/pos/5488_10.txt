One case to be in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He gets things done. He is available. And it's also easy to see why the vest hates him so much. He has control over the country's resources and returns the profits to the people. Mostly the poor. And it's easy to see how the TV stations can depict misleading images to put a case in there. Like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or those who lack WMD's. Or what about the axis of evil. People have to wake up. And get different views. Stop the neo downs that govern the world. Go see this movie with an open mind. And pick up your own mind. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russos: America: Freedom of Fascism. It is not the people of America who are the problem. It's the government.
