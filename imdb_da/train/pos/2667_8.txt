I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience as loud sounds and scary children. They usually lack originality and contain overactive masses. The only horror movie I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well traded and had a great story. But it has been connected and perhaps even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, possibly the scaliest movie ever. The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to review a hotel while it is closed in the winter. There were rumors that the place was haunted, and the last resident was crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced that it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. However, after months of solitude and silence, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there anything in the hotel that drives him sour? <br /> <br /> One of the horrific parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick does. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge but always empty. It is also terribly quiet when Jack's son rides his bike through the harsh times. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he speaks with a ghost from inside a walk-in fridge. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Shining is the tops of horror movies, turning out of screams like Ring and The Blair Witchcraft. It may be an old-fashioned one, but it is definitely a hello. 8.10
