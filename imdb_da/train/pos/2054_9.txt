When I first heard about the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons like many other reviewers, but when I threw it, I was completely stunned that so many great character actors would be in this! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction) who plays the title character, McBain. He is rescued from a Vietnam POW camp by some of his friends, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks) who subdivides a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnam soldiers bear cash apparently) and tells him he can again serve him if he ever gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> So 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) go with the rebels in Colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, taxi driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good ol 'Vietnam friends to help him. First there is the token hard black guy Eastland, played by "American Ninja's Steve James, who was also in director James Glickenhaus's previous movie," The Exterminator ", where the explosive's real name was also Eastland, coincidence? There are also many other references to The Exterminator, including the most noteworthy that McBain himself wears a welding mask when Christina sees him for the first time when working on a welding work on a bridge! <br /> <br / > The other guys in the Vietnam package are: The rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there is doc, Dalton (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like the guy the IMDb attaches to, and I haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there is a policeman, Gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfactory job, he is the game by Thomas G. Waites, some of whom may remember The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other major roles, we find Luis Guzm√°n Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way, as a small-time dealer who can't get a decent job. There is also Dick Boccelli as a drug-dealing kingpin who is hung up in a crane at the top of a roof at the McBain hallway. Almost then he was hung over a meat mill by John Eastland in EXTERMINATOR movies! Now I haven't seen Glickenhaus' "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to bet half a hundred dollar bill that Boccelli gets stuck in that movie too! <br /> <br /> Well, back to the plot of this movie .. they go out to Colombia and save the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the throw is amazing and the action scenes are very well done and you never get bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended for all action lovers!
