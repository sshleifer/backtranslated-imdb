I saw this jolly little movie aged 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To judge it from a child's point of view, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars because it was a young boy at that time, it seemed a little "girlish". <br /> <br /> The climate game where Gazooks tickles daylights out of everyone was a little disturbing at the time, but you grow that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered a Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to see it again! I liked it even though it looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer here got the idea that it was not on VHS. It's out there. Maybe even be on DVD now, at least I hope it is. I'd like to share it with my kids someday! 10 stars here, it's still a great kids movie. (end) <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a VHS copy !! Woo-hoo!
