I recently rented this document, remembering to hear about it from IMDb.com and was fascinated by the premise. I knew very little about one of these bands, but I remember hearing "Not if you were the last junkie on earth" by The Dandy Warhols long ago and enjoyed it. That said, this is my perspective on doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible about this movie is there is no reason to have any prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time engaging the audience and telling them to the people in this movie. I was quickly shaken to life both Anton and Courtney as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this document so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such a master documentarian. <br /> <br /> I also loved the story of "these" bands. Most of what you see is of the band on tour. Both bands are starting to play small venues and are struggling to do so in the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. But that's what makes the two bands the same, and thus the brilliant perspective on how two spring bands can go in such different directions. I would basically recommend it to anyone who likes movies in general. You don't have to have a special love for documentaries, or one of the tapes. An understanding of music helps, but the music itself takes a back seat to the love relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
