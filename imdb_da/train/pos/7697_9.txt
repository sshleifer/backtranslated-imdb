This is another great movie I had the fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al.). Back in the late 80's I was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new to the three major JC, SH & YB. I wasn't sure what to expect when I paid my hard earned money to see this in a "Triple Bill of Classics" on the old Scala. I don't have to worry, I was out of breath with this movie. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and haven't seen this movie, do it now!
