In this movie, JUST, when the production code was enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick "Kitty". The girl from Missouri starts with the girls on the train, where Eadie promises herself to make money while looking for a millionaire man and stays in the process completely. It doesn't take long to meet Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the friendly Doctor in Grand Hotel, and Judge Hardy in the "Andy Hardy" films.) But everything is not as it seems .. Censors must have loved Harlow's line. "A girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that of a gentleman unless she was engaged." Later, someone says, "You know we've never been alone together," and Eadie answers, "Yes, and we're not going to be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, opercrust who comes to his rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares, "You must scrape me off your list - I'm not a ladies man" .... I wonder what that line would have been just a few years earlier before the Hayes code entered the city . What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to be the senior "Baby Talker" as stated in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939, with "Munchkin" in the Wizard of Oz as the last part she played. Fun cleansing body as the girls hunt men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who was an 1920 wrestler (silver medalist) became movie star (he was in many of Dr. Kildares, and would be seen in four of Harlow's films.) Error Identity, Plot Twists, a Young Franchot Tone, Love Stories , even Jean Harlow in a swimsuit in "Palm Beach", although outdoor scenes in the center seem to be a backdrop.
