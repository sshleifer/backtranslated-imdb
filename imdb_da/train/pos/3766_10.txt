Visually creative epic of infinite style. <br /> <br /> This movie can have neither the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic spectacle. But who dares to say that this movie is no art? I am not a supporter of the idea that an important movie should be serious, non-commercial or bothering me with questions. Even there are many movies that match those attributes that I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is probably not one of those films. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive charged, childish energy. This movie does not reflect reality. Its friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time to live in! Apart from the music ;-) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I always wanted movies and scenery of this movie. Particularly at this point, Bogus Journey is far from its prequel. The effects are also good, and I think most of them are very much made without cgi. I generally prefer the good old effects in large budget films. Sure it is "just another Hollywood movie" out of some people's minds. But I think it is in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word for the soundtrack: All the band and orchestral music fit very well into the movie. Also the sound design has no shortage. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this trace of Winger from the stage 'station' building the bill and ted the robots in the habit. I love the unorthodox camera work in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very imaginative! It is far better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. It's definitely better than citizen sleigh, apocalypse now or chris markers sense soleil ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... No way! Yes way! Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Who dares to disagree, is guilty of "artsy-speed behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation (what is the greater self-denial) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not the better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior successor. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior successor! It is not!
