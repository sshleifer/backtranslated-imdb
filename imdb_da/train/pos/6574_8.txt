It can be difficult to get some people to come in, who are used to Hollywood production styles. The management is uninspired, apparently simply recording the scene's setup, and the sound quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people's clothing is competing with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I began to see without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost put us off. It seemed very stagy and cheesy. Then we picked up the tone of the content and really began to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun, despite a bit of greed. Definitely give it a try if you value dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is of course sweet.
