Love it or destroy it, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty's take on the "Dick Tracy", the 1990 movie adaptation of Chester Gould's famous cartoon, anything but a genre classic. Superhero films have come out of the woodwork in recent years and can soon become a genre alone. <br /> <br /> Beatty's movie uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six stripes of primary colors, thus giving this unique yet familiar world of triggerless mutant gangsters and solving seductive women a lush visual style and tone. It can be said that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically shorten the characters and their plays, which I do not believe can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" looks forward to his looks and scary characters, and Beatty himself, who plays dogs and indestructible detective of the title, is suitably stoic and ready to bust the evil at any cost. <br /> <br /> Other than the visual treats and the Oscar-winning makeup there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, leaking over-the-top in an Oscar nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tr acy in a well-planned trait, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal acts in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tracy accompanies his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as the name would have it, remains faithful to his side and cares about The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who ultimately finds a father figure to look up in our criminal busting hero. Tracy's faithfulness to Tess has been tested by the tempting progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's biggest press. While all this goes down, things are warmed up when a new criminal figure comes in the city and decides to play both sides toward the center. The performance is good as Beatty focuses on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leaders becoming the center of the material, as opposed to concentrating only on meaningless action and special effects. Pacino fears free the landscape in a role that really stands out from the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked comic book genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty's assuming his beloved crime detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
