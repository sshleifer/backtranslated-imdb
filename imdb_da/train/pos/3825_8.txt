A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after he has gone into an accident. She hardly turns down in this small town, but shortly afterwards she loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... It can lead to all sorts of plots in a normal movie: Find a new partner and be happy finally; or depressed enough to fight and eventually kill himself ... She tries to kill herself, but not after a series of serious fights with God. She trusts in God only to find out that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I have to be careful about God, that doesn't matter to God. The way in which the film deals with the question is quite interesting: not in the point of view of women or from the perspective of God (in that way there would be lots of grass plants, clouds flying flying views, I assume). Rather, it is from a third party's eye that the film allows us to perceive and explain nothing. <br /> <br /> The movie wouldn't be so interesting, there was only the woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman and of course in love with her, but in her own way. He is a funny guy, like a clown, I should say who is shamelessly about our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman full of excitement, crying and always throwing up, and the man who smiles and speaks silly, ends in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too boring. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
