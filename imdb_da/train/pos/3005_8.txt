This is still the benchmark of judging all Golden Age whodunnits, and given the limited technology and questionable ethical standards of the authorities (on-screen), welcomes all generations of similar trials since film and television. Fast and furious with lots of Warner Bros wipes, and fortunately no time for a love interest it galops along with the amazing cast of it to the violent end. I never understood why DA had to track Vance around everywhere, I always thought they were desk-bound. Palette as a detective, but especially Girardot as the doctor is lovely eccentric and un-PC - when he slips over the other murder victim, he sneaks that there were too many people in the world anyway. Of course, it is William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) who makes the film what it is - when did Powell ever make a dud? <br /> <br /> The police of the crime scene did not really do a very good job finding the other dead body and unconscious dog they did! The best bit is where Vance tells us all the order of events around the murders - the dodgy model set combines with amazing riveting camera angles to produce a very modern feel and scary with what has been before. The only problem is, as usual, that the conclusion cannot correspond to the overall deductive processes that appear all the time and a somewhat constructed ending is relied upon; Of course, some Chan's, Moto's and many others could only be completed this way. But because it happens so fast and is ... a little questionable morally, it does not diminish my opinion of KMC's status as a classic! All the pictures I have ever seen at KMC are (at worst) like looking at a goldfish bowl, so if you are interested in seeing it carry it until you are sucked in.
