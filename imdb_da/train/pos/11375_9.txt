This film tells a great story of history and compassion. From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the main researcher, you will be attracted. It is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol connections and how the agencies work together are also good. Not too done either. I recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history too. How the police work with the political party is what it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It has been a while since I first saw this movie. It does not diminish its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough to the imagination, yes, you want to see.
