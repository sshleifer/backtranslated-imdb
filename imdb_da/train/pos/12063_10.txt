The Woman in Black (1989) is a television adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, which was published only a few years earlier than the movie was made. Unfortunately, this movie has not been released on DVD, and as far as I know, it has been deleted on VHS. It is accessibility in direct contrast to its popularity among those who know about horror movies. The story is about events in a coastal society in the early 20th century, where a young lawyer was sent by his firm to conclude a recently deceased widow who died in his isolated marshland. What he thought would be a routine and probably boring task turned into a nightmare when he discovered that the old woman was haunted for her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, never to be self-righteous, flashy or over-expositional. The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but that's just what history needs and why it works so well. That's what you don't see that scares. That said, there is a particularly scary scene that is dependent on the visual, and it works to perfection. I watched this movie during the day, and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you love being scared, do what you need to get hold of and see a copy of The Woman In Black.
