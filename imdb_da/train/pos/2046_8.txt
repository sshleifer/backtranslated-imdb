While the audio track is a bit dated, this story is more relevant in the US now than ever. With not only blue collars, but everyone's work is being outsourced by US companies, while government profits and Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker who works the same work his father did for 35 years. His wife is well portrayed by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses her job. The mill is closed under the pretext of poor management, but there is also confusion and cheaper wages where they can pay a steel worker in one month (outsourcing) what they should pay Strauss / Emory a day. Remember, these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try the best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and a couple of other colleagues are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes that his local union will be able to reopen the mill as they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> Emory brother Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There are no jobs left in the belt (Ohio) and they must continue. But where in the US can they move to?. Where will it be better for a craftsman ?? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end, where Emory and his crew fill the cargo bin with steel products. The guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy. Generally, a good message about tough times right here in America. Something that has nothing to worry about until it is personally affected. 8.10.
