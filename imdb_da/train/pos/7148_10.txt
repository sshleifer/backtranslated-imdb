This movie is one I highly recommend. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnat's (Shia LeBeouf), who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a boys detention center. There he has to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. While he meets the other boys in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-ray and ZigZag). Everyone is digging, not to "build charactor", but to find a ban on Kate Barlow's treasure. Throughout the film (and book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5 because I'm very picky when it comes to books for movies (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY). But it did really well.
