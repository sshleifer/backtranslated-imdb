My God ! Buttgereits masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films, this is truly disturbing, but not cruel as Necromancy. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the management is quite inventive, despite the lack of money (see "bro" sketch). Highly recommended!
