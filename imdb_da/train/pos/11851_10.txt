At a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, this film reminds us of the notion of "indomitable spirit". If you feel knocked down, this movie will release you and set you up. We all know how hard life can be, once we must be reminded that perseverance and courage will get us through. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it will for you.
