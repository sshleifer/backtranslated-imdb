I am honestly surprised at how little has happened in movies at Columbine Massacre. There is not a big documentary, very confusing. Fortunately, we are splendid with the talent Ben Coccio, who instructed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who did just fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacres will always be a mystery that ultimately is somewhat confusing and ignorant of the two boys' motivation and what actually drove them to carry it out of fantasy in terrible reality. ZERO DAY, which allegedly consists of video tapes made by the sliders and found after the event, is completely rivets. Even if you know where it is going, you still have the hope that it won't "go there" ... and the excitement of the last minute movie is scary. The movie is fantastic from top to bottom, from instructor to script (not very improvised, even if it seems very spontaneous) to the two main actors and the supporting players too. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that worried me. Okay, so we can't understand why the shooters would do what they did, but surely one of their contributors was ANGER. But these boys do not seem really angry. They can say some things to indicate they are, but they actually did not convince me that they had anything inside them that forced them to kill innocent people. But it still leaves me with the feeling of "why ???" that the director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will crawl up on you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH people could only wish for that kind of success these guys had to make a mock documentary.
