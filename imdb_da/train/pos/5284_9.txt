Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. When his son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the talks finally take place. they are difficult and growth is needed on both. <br /> <br /> This movie brings us into these two traveling hearts, and it is actually a great journey for the audience as well as the two principles. The whole picture is impressive, especially the last scenes in Mecca. It again emphasizes to me how much the world can be, but at the same time, how similar. The same was true of the father and son of this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You will be glad you did.
