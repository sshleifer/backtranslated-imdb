John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen for a while. It gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker gets bigger than his city can handle, and he is separated from his beloved (including a sexy Ricci) by his male art director. The image left a refreshing taste in my mouth - like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was rather flat and simplified, it only made the whole grip deeper and critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to carry weapons ... and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
