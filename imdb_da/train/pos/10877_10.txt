I watched this movie with a bunch of friends, and although only two of us went out of the cinema thought how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well that was because it wasn't supposed to be so serious, it is basically a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a crooked job. There seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm ... Scary movie ?? Well this is Aussie and original !!! Jessica Napier has a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a defined bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was an even better move. The impossible princess was queen of the screen !! I recommend watching this flick as you guess the very connection with Raffy, Hilary and The Movie, who never finished 20 years ago.
