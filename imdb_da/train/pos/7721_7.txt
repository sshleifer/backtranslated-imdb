A flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space scientists travels hundreds of millions of light-years from the ground to check into a colony founded 25 years ago on a forbidden planet. What they find is a robot that is more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and completely socially unlucky young woman and her father, a hermit philologist who is haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has set up in. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but it is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped by what makes it a scifi movie, surely, its The Tempest, but how many hundred movies can you say like this? <br /> <br /> Below is a warning story of progress and technology and the social development needed for its proper and safe use. Nevertheless, the film continues with all the hope for our future that we have come from shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this movie is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics behind the scenes, are powerful enough to make the uninspired steering and the inconsistent almost unnoticed. If it wasn't for the greasy retro-art deco of the 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of the very special subgenre of sci fi I like to call the 1950s sci-fi, and although it's not the best, it's definitely a must see for anyone interested in sci-fi movies and special effects. The clever plot that is now being reused in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to and will maintain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will especially be interested in the various aspects of the film, which seem to have inspired themes from the original Star Trek series, which were broadcast about 12 years later, although they may be disappointed with the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and lack on any kind of racial integration. While I didn't think of nitpick, the lack of social progress in this movie was the biggest problem I had with it. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this movie just to catch a glimpse of young, handsome Leslie Nielsen in one of his first major roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and sometimes down-right-poor (especially in the climax of the movie). Walter Pigeon, although quite excellent in other films, also exaggerates his role. Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, but overall the actors in the ensemble play a good job. The problems with the highlighted notions are, in my opinion, just as great as the director's and editor's fault. Although they certainly got most of the movie right.
