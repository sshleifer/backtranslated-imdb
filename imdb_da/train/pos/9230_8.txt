There is so much that can be said about this movie. It's not your typical nunsploitation. Of course there are nudity and sex with nuns, but it is almost random for the story. It is set in the 15th century in Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The fight between the Muslims and the Christians occupies a good part of the film. It was interesting when all ran out of the Muslim hoards that the mother's superior would ask, "Why do you fear the Muslims, they will not do anything that Christians have done for you?" There was certainly enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a monastery to hesitate her father. In the process of witnessing and performing many things: a stallion, a rape of a local woman by a new duke, a youth's torture that was overcome during a visit by Tarantula Sect, and a whipping herself when she ran off a Jew. The torture was particularly cruel, with hot wax poured into the nun, and her nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is committed to continuing to face problems as she questions the male-dominated community in which she lives. She even asks Jesus why the father, son, and holy ghost are all men. <br /> <br /> Finally, she joins the Muslim leader as her lover and they beat the monastery. Here's where you see more meat than you might enjoy at once. But the tragedy must come. She manages to clarify sweet revenge at all, including the Duke and her father, but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same. She is a woman, and that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> I don't want to describe what the sacred men of the church did for this heretic at the end, but it is torture of Saw or Hostel for decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be happy with treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
