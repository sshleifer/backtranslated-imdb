Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" may well be the high quality mark for the Shaw Brothers martial arts cycle. This bursting kung fu epic boasts a fantastic cast - a true who is who of the Shaw staff. Although the plot is quite standard and combat choreography is fantastic as normal, it is Cheh's handling of the subject that makes this movie remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of reverence shown for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple can be seen in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley's paean for the fabulous Fighting 69th in the same title movie or John Ford's salute to West Point in "The Long Gray Line", Cheh's Shaolin Temple is a lovingly crafted ode in the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I'm tempted to do is to compare the Shaolin Temple with the Alamo. Watching this movie will give the same admirable and nostalgic feelings you experienced many years ago in class history as you learned about the courage and sacrifice of the convicted heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the movie you may also be tempted to call out, remember the Shaolin Temple!
