Spoiler for anyone lucky enough to watch this movie (so don't really spoil it all). Saw this movie as it was released and still remember parts of it. It's all in a small town in the west or what's left of the city. It looks more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them is a couple where the wife is particularly wicked. She lets her husband die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her next, but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply. She doesn't realize it soon, she gets very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad in a fun mansion - but that's another story I can't remember for good. The remaining impression of the movie was that it was one of the first times I saw a really evil woman on movies pretending to be anything but evil - cannot be compared to the witch in 'Snowwhite' in comparison easy to find out. Very close western with few main characters and still absorbing.
