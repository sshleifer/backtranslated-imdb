I watched this movie back at the Palm Springs International Festival 2005 and out of the 14 movies I saw there, I would rate this # 4. The 900+ theater was full and eventually got a standing ovation. This was classic Peter Falk, if you are a Falk fan and showed a lot of chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser figures. The movie's title seemed to be long and too strange to sound to me. I'm surprised this didn't make it for general release. This was far better than most of the unwanted ones the big studios throw at you. Maybe for adults it was geared for baby boomer and senior audience. Many people could relate to situations in this movie. This will probably be a revival of many years from now when people look back at this movie and consider it a kind of gem. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
