This is your standard musical comedy from the 30s, with a big plus that it includes some well-known '30's actors in small fun cameos. <br /> <br /> There's not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and "no worries" general kind of atmosphere, with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it. Appereantly, it's a 'Cinderella story', but I didn't think that way at all while I watched the movie. The story becomes very confused in the story, which contains many different characters and also many small cameo appearances when the protagonists hit the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy looks and shows some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy card with it for free. Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long looks into the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as director of the short. It is certainly true that all the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character, but in this case it is no problem as it is much more fun and interesting to see than the main plot line and shallow typical main character . <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly no worse than any of its other genre films from the same era, although the rating here would suggest something else. <br /> <br /> 7/10
