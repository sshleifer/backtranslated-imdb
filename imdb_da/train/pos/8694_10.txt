It was in 1988 when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At that time I was already a very big fan of Spitting Image (since then, it won the bronzerose at the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course, I recorded each show on tape and watched it over and over - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie was standing in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thought it was a mirror) and said to himself "I need a shave". Or most entertaining of all when he played the ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's such a shame that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion; It was one of the most amazing and intelligent TV shows ever. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it was absolutely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years have passed since then and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
