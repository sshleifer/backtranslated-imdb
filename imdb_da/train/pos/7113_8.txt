From Filipino suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes in the center, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeastern city. Good shots of the old terraced houses as they looked then. The movie turns into a bit "chatty" at times - which makes the viewer lose the interest for a short time ... but the overall story is solid and very moving. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to watch the movie "Bright Victory", also with local images of Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus. None of these movies is out in any format and I can't imagine why. I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area!
