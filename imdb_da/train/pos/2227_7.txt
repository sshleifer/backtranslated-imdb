This will get reviews all over the card because it does not fit comfortably to any form. It's horror - but not a splatter party. It's just as much Suspense as Horror - but without the usual Hollywood screaming and shaking camera. <br /> <br /> The movie's feeling is free and leaned beside no special effects, because I think you should listen and see the characters faces. Forget that Brendan is a candidate from the Buffy universe. It's a red herring. He's acting here. 'Camp' is a misrepresentation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives a rock solid performance - so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know the apologies that apologize, where the actors clearly don't care more and just wait for the director to snap "Cut" and get their pay slips. This is not the case here. Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost cheerful fun regularity. I don't think the intention was humorous - but to keep you out of balance. <br /> <br /> Think of the lesser of a Horror 'Movie' and more of a Horror 'Play' at a stage - the detached whitewashed house. Then you can see that it is really about paranoia, fear and spiraling madness seen in an isolated place, the United States. <br /> <br /> And it's twisted. Time driving, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazis who may NOT be dead. . .I. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. This would be a good choice for a Saturday midnight sit down.
