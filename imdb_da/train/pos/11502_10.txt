As a forty-something urban scientist / photography and long-standing fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my early childhood is an aspect that has not really been mentioned, the amount of urban exploration, Carl's character, was taken during the series. He always managed to get into a big job, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed with only his faithful penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primal monkey episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other tool to either protect himself or make exploration easier. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently purchased DVD sets of the two pilot films and subsequent TV episodes and have slowly reviewed all the shows. And even though I remember seeing them back in the early 70s when they were first sent, it had been over 30 years ... so many of them seem new all the time again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and very entertaining. They just don't do things like this these days. Now it's all upset spin-offs with predictable characters and plots. Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and faith the series will continue with new generations of fans in the coming years.
