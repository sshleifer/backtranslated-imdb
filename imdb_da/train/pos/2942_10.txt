LAUGH OUT LOUD !!! delirious was so funny .. i was in tears. Eddie Murphy's impression is definitely on the spot. The best impression was James Brown and Mr T> so much fun !! It's strange how Eddie Murphy was back then and how he is now DELIRIOUS is a must see, but if you don't like spooky language, don't look BUT BIG AND SO FUNNY .. I've seen it 6/7 times and still kits myself every time .. This is Eddie Murphy on his prime and you can see where he got humor and ideas about movies as a nutty professor from. He also makes an impression of his family, which is great fun. <br /> <br /> If only I was there ...
