Old horror movies are interesting, lots of screams, lots of shouts and lots of humor to keep up with. "The Blob" is a classic in its own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to be a hero in his city. Going out on a date with her girl is quite typical of all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same falling object from heaven, he stops being the victim, and Steve helps him with the best he can. When it's up to teen power, this movie really does. I know that most teenagers have had their hardships when acting when danger comes, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When the adults in town ended up learning the tough road about "The Blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teens and not let their behavior get better off them. The oozing juggernaut was pretty sweet on the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone stands in the way of stopping the threat, the city is again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time if you don't like Jello, TUG! RATING 5 STARS
