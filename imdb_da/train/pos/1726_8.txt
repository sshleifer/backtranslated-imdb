While I was thinking of "The Great Escape", I got my mind wandering back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. I had read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949, which inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used the word then actually) in the city that showed "foreign" movies, I was first in line to buy my ticket. As someone led up to the news of the wartime and propaganda films during World War II, I had a keen interest in exploring the realities of the conflict reflected in memoirs and stories of men who were there personally. It later extended for an eager will over the years to buy a book on the subject and finally read the equally compelling novels by Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, who gave an even deeper sensibility. However, the film productions were, unlike this, because they rarely delivered the goods. <br /> <br /> The media in black and white films has never been served virtually in those years. I have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as the deep chiaroscuros of movies like "The Wooden Horse." If it is true that we are always destined to be caught in the pictures of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as the symbolic British war hero on film. Not even Sir Alec.
