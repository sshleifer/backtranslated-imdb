Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Out of the blue, his father announces that Reda will drive him to Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something Reda has no interest in doing but is solely committed. As a result, from the beginning, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim man, his father is hard to talk to or discuss his concerns. Both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it is very ironic when Dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it talks about how much the signs grew and began to know each other. However, I really don't think they did, and that's the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and oppression. I really liked this and appreciated that there wasn't a complete solution to this - as it would have been unclear. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well-acted and fascinating - giving Westerners an unusual insight into Islam and Hajj. It also provides a fascinating compilation of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity of the entire movie may annoy some, I think it gave the movie intense realism and made it look like a movie about humans - not a formula. A nice and unusual movie.
