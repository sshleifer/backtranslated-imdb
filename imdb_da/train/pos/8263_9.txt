This movie with the WESTFRONT 1918 is my favorite PABST-directed movie, and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films that played Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). This is probably because both are very similar to the neo-realistic films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film encouraged to use non-actors (just typical people) in everyday settings to create intense and realistic films. In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately the people in the roles act as miners - not actors. The central conflict that the movie begins is that there is a big mine located on the French-German border. Instead of a big mine, it is divided on the border, and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite the fact that there is greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance scene) and WWI gather to create a large gap between the phonics - resulting in a WE vs THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a major collapse in the French, and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risk to their own lives they show that there is genuine companionship between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to make the German audience look in vain of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously fluid movie with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. However, considering the story, the film's impact was minimal at best. It is a shame that, like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL STILL THE FRONT FRONT (Milestone) had good messages of peace and harmony, but in the end there were errors in a positive swinging public opinion. So from a historical point of view it is a wonderful and sad relic that is worth seeing.
