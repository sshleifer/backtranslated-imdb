The movie version of Alice Walker's hugely emotional and influential 1983 novel (written almost like letters from the central character Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave his best screen performance for miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the burning woman tame of fate. Others in cast cast out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the side - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's fierce man; Margaret Avery as Shug, a power of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in 1973 film of Jesus Christ's Superstar) as pastor Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully paced and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' makes justice its source while opening history to involve viewers of feature-length drama.
