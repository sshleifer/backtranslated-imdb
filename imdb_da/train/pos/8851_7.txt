While the title "Before the devil knows you are dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the movie is played as a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a shaky robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers try to escape the mess they've got in. <br /> <br /> Casting is joined by Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke plays the aforementioned brothers. Remarkable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as a brother's wife and the other's lover. Apart from these instructors, the action is unremarkable. <br /> <br /> The story is convincing and is told with some degree of enlistment. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by giving different views and frequent timescales. That said, the film's unpredictability is somewhat subdued, as it is clear that this story is a tragedy through and through. All in all, a pretty impressive debut for the first-time writer, Kelly Masterson. Sidney Lumet's direction is well managed, but I am more impressed with the fact that he still manages over 80 years of age. I was less impressed with the score by Carter Burwell, but it's not a big distraction. In the end, the film shows to be convincing viewing, and while history and presentation may have superficial similarities with other films this one is a unique experience.
