This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Your mother is killed by a drunk driver, so their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole performance is about living life. The girls go through life's problems and have life lessons. They develop crushes, boyfriends and many more. The whole show is basically going with the stream. You don't have to be angry, just let it go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and still see it today. I'm glad they still fly this show on TV. I see it almost every day. I judge it 10/10.
