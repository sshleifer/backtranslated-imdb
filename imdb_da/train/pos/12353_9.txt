A tragic wonderful movie ... brings us to a Japan that no longer exists. Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, I have not yet seen a (hollywood) movie that can match the atmosphere's authenticity in this small river town near the sea ... Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai resembled the last installment of the Lord of the Rings trying to pick up rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like serene but intense story lines, this is a must see movie. It will be a respite from hollow flashy movies, just like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. I think this is one of Kurosawa's better stories. Although it is a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings, it did not become a skin girl. The characters are full of depth and work with great intensity.
