Damn straight ..... this show was kick ass back today and continues to shadow comics today. I can't wait to track some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles) and I laughed my head when he told me one day "Dad ... you sure looked at some amazing cartoons when you were a kid! "How cool is that. <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, dust this one and give it a live action try. Couldn't be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 has been quite lame so far for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll shuddup now <br /> <br /> Bowl
