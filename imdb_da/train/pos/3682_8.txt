Often, films of this kind come across as a mixed bag of great work along with easy drive to fill the runtime. Whether it's the big name support or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. I really think I can say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the amazing end-of-life sequence, the interlacing of characters in a final image of love in Paris, I think the movie would have suffered if any gears were removed. True, there are certainly a few standouts that overshadow the rest, but in the end I have a lasting picture, even though just a split second of each card vignette. Love takes many forms and the talent here rises to the occasion, to surprise and move the audience through sharp poetry and elegance of the many facets of emotion. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprise as a fabric-dressed actress shoots in Paris and meets with her dealer. The statement by its conclusion leaves you a bit of balance as the transformation between the two changes hands. <br/> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a relationship from an old Cassavette movie) bring some good, sharp soft and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their upcoming divorce. What of their conversation is true and what is just to anger against the other, it is fun and leaves a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of love that exists beyond religious and racial differences. It is a cute little story of shy love between two people who obviously feel a connection, but it is not possible to vocalize it. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I will admit that I am disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence Together, this live action tale of mimes who falls in love with a prison in Paris is the same ornate nature like his movie Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Coen Brothers adhere to their weird sense of humor and lives some fine laughs. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the show without speaking a word. His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a dissatisfied Frenchman are invaluable. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here's a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about to get it back in the light of the tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson a movement the couple deals with and find out how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: A surprisingly fun little tale from horrester Wes Craven. A little Oscar Wilde humor can add levitation to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to exercise the fantastic long he takes perfection in Children of men with this tale of two people in love, walking down the street. As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier ultimately come up close, we also find the true connection in their conversation with "forbidden love." Porte de Choisy: A very surreal look at Paris' glamor. This is probably the strangest entrance, but so exciting that you can't look away from the madness that follows. Don't anger your Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that undergoes a role-playing game that seems to have stagnated for years. A slight variation from Bob Hoskins is needed to be turned up. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love among feeding times. I don't know if I should like Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully shot and subdued to allow the blood-red's liveliness, this short is strange, but then it is love. 14th arrondissement: Let it be for Alexander Payne's odd sense of humor to really add a depth to this voice-over story told of an American in Paris to find what love is. Her hard, uneducated French is a very sharp contrast to the authentic accents we've listened to until that point is as big as being both fun and true to the story. Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the case. Paris can be a city spoiled for everyday activities such as finding a parking lot, but when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner everywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno shows brilliantly what love for a child is through her subtle performance, as the story is booked by her song for a small child, yet completely different every time. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite story of the pile. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply amazing. The cyclical nature of history and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for Boro to finally ask for coffee is hard to see. Sometimes love at your last moment is enough to accept a leaving of this earth. Place des Victoires: One of the best stories of a mother trying to kill her young son's death. Juliette Binoche is devastating as the mother, desperate for a last glimpse of her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as the cowboy giving her the chance. Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you have to think he has lost love to accept that he has not been fully invested in the relationship. Melchior Beslon recalls and tries to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp, quick cuts from his meeting Natalie Portman as far as "see" how much he needs her. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Let Gus Van Sant show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his film almost always deals with some form of alienation. His photographer from Elephant is an American worker in Paris who is the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel's artistic ramblings of love and soulmates. Sometimes you do not need to know what is said to understand what happens during the breaks.
