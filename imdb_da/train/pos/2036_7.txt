- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> Looking at the votes of "Creep" today, I was surprised that so many IMDb users rated this movie "1". I wonder: What do people expect from such a kind of movie? Are there so many people watching movies without knowing about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's a pretty good one! This means automatically: It has an absurd story full of holes, monstrous dangers and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just grab some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then ... ... enjoy being afraid of death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing but Kate and a lonely metro station are incredibly scary. There is excitement and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a flashing neon lamp behind you. (In my opinion, the audio editor has the best job in this movie.) When Kate meets with the pursuer, the quality of the movie falls, but it still doesn't become a bad movie. The other part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well finished and the story is quite well developed. (... as long as you remember it's a horror movie you see and not the Discovery Channel!) So if you want to make yourself a very, very scary hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then leave the cinema or turn off your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, right? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you see this movie up to the end, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: Leave the cinema on dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home .. .
