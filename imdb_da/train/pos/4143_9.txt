No, I'm not joking around. If you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie watch it. If you need to cut your arm out to see it, see it. It is worth it. <br /> <br /> The Fatty Drives bus is unlike any movie you've ever seen. It takes trash and raises it to a work of art. While it contains bad shots, idiotic characters, poor dialogue, strange acting and filmography belonging to public access in Iowa, it actually manages to achieve its goal as a movie. It strives to be the stupidest, weirdest, and scary movie you've ever seen. And the boy ever succeeds. <br /> <br /> I would like to explain the plot to those of you who care about such things (of course the filmmakers do not) but you really don't have to pay too much attention because the whole movie's plot is presented in a very long piece text played before the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus ride through Chicago, led by Satan. You see that Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers on the bus must die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except Jesus in the city, call a bully in the hell job, and it fears Satan because well, he can't likes to look like a fool in front of the guy, so he decides to get the people on the bus to write over their souls directly to him, but he is a devil so he must pamper himself, otherwise who would go on a trip with him, so he pamperes himself as Roger and he comes on the bus where the driver is never referred to name, but he is a little fat, so I think he's fat. The bus (and the riders) are on a collision course with wackiness! <br /> <br /> Examples of some lunacy: The title is repeated on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. A sign appears on the bus in the middle of the trip without explanation or introduction, and usually sits next to the others, and they look at her as if she doesn't belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and offer long-lasting looks that are really the same shots repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan gives a minute-long monologue to turn into human form, a title card flashes "Satan must transform." I do not know why. A character is a woman who is obviously a man in a row, and referred to by other characters as "the glamorous Bridget." I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there was a good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer, it got my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
