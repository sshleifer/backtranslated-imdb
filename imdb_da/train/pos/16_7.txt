I found this to be such a romance / drama that has a nice ending and a generally good sense of it. It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family movie with sleeping-before-marriage considered "normal" behavior, but considering the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro I would have expected a much harder movie, at least linguistically. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is the portrayal of how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. It's the movie's big theme, and it involves some touching scenes, but to be honest, the movie is not so memorable. It is still a fairly mild, good story I would recommend.
