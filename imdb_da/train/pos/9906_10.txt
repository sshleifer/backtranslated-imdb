YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, the play ranges from average to ridiculous. Yes, it has been done so many times before. But what we are dealing with is a movie that does not depart from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. In fact, there are some original death scenes, and the excitement is rising throughout the film. In addition, you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. I urge everyone to watch this movie with an immediate eye and see it for what it turned out to be; a scary, fun slasher flick with a second-rate theme.
