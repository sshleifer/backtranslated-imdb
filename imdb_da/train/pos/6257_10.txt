This documentary by Marian Cooper is amazing. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I will see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. The movie footage does not all look blurry and chopped as you might think from the 1925 B&W silent movie. Seen in Iran in 1925, the nomadic tribesmen in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then again and over a snow-covered mountain, the whole barefoot passes. It is sinking or swimming and climbing or dying. Hunting for grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In a scene, a man carries a mule that is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes in Iran are still living like this. Make you appreciate the modern life of the United States.
