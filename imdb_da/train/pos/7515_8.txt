I've known about Bettie Page for many years now. The soft core porn pictures from her from the 1950s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. The "Bettie Page" look is also still very popular in the heterosis fetish world and remains so distinctive today as it did then. So I saw this movie with little knowledge to begin with. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Seeing the movie's recreation of actual characters such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager ?? Everyone is considering trailblazers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired atmosphere of sexual oppression and hypocrisy in the 1950s America along with a sexuality that, according to today's standards, was innocent to the extreme. I especially liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate that Bettie found in. I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting Betty's character in all her innocent sexuality and throughout her complete naivety. Bettie loved to look nice, loved the attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing in "stupid clothes" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires that everything that elicited was completely lost to her. So far she still does not understand what "all that was about" when it comes to her pictures or the S&M content of them. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that she is uneducated or simply to understand it is simply that she does not "get it" about fetishism and never will. No harm there. Bettie Page is simply the one she is. The movie caught it quite nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s depicted by Mrs Harron and written by her with Guinevere Turner really makes me happy that I live in the day and age I do. Hypocrisy and oppression combined with the massive ignorance of our sexuality are all combined into a frightening swell. The film fits in well with this and brings rejoicing as Bettie keeps everything with her incredible faith and her immutable naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit slow at times, but hit all the points that Mrs Harron tried and beat them well. I would recommend this movie even to those people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with such interests, this movie is a must see.
