I must say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and had a jacket. Then, when all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a sign resembling Bill Paxson, but it was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21. This was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camper's (Alan Arkin) most memorable. Later, this same girl interacted and talked about her camp experiences. It had no meaning. She would have been a year old. That said, the film turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the lovely guy who was always teased. A guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an ancient campor who admits that he has grown in touch with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers were successful in life. None of them had very good careers. This seemed very real life. The movie was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it wasn't as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So even though the start is not promising, the film ended up being quite good.
