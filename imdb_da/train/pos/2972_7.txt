I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and expected basketball to be fun, but not as good as it turned out to be! I think that's what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and in no way bother to take seriously. Relax stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor that was present in Basketball was not popular at the time of its release, and if it came out today, it would be a hit. Don't try to be critical, just drop your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Highly recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
