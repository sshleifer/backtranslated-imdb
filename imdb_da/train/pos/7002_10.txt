Will Smith deliver yet again in a movie about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to straighten his clock in a way that will touch even the most hardened hearts! Author Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and create a masterpiece that I highly recommend buying and keeping in your movie collection, as you will never get tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant actor, but one can tell that he has a true love of people and life, which undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this movie. You will find yourself feeling your pain and anger, the frustrations of his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was amazing as usual. I found myself in love with their characters falling in love. Woody Harrelson is also stars in this Top Notch movie. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points ... All I can say is, see it, and when you make sure you have nothing to disturb you, take the phone off, lean back and get ready to start trying to dig up the mysterious life and past of the IRS Agent Ben Thomas ... I thank Will Smith for another great movie !!!
