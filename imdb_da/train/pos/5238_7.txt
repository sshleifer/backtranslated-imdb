I liked Top Gun. It had my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and story line. It's very much like High Noon, as the city's people seem to be weak and afraid to stand up for a villain. This movie has some quality actors who really didn't get the chance to share all their talents. Also some of the players did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a nice man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor is excellent in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with poor material. It is hard to imagine him as a pistol. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two men might have fought over her. Ugh. Finally How can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
