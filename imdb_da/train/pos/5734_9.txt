I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, for he gives viewers unique motion pictures with typical Lynch elements. After seeing most of his works, I thought naively that I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could never have imagined under the name of David Lynch. But after my recovery from the first shock, I began to consider this extremely primitive protagonist, and I concluded that all the absurdity, cruelty, brutality, and disgust presented here reflect the bit of reality, stressed by distorting it. There are things in our life that we hardly ever stress because they are either obnoxious or awful, but they surround us, so I take courage to say that Dumbland focuses on those pieces. It's not a movie to enjoy, though sometimes you are laughing at a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we'd rather refuse to observe with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it. It only exists. And finally, if you're aware enough, you'll also find items that are typical of Lynch. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
