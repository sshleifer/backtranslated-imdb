I have had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie shows what many of them are, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, as well as very unjust. From the robotic flesh, hustling for gifts, to lies and fraud, I have experienced it all in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the picture records for my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It contains thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls I met, black comedy, scams I was interested in, and the story of my shaking and appearance on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent lots of time with it. Then check it out. The Russian woman, who Nicole Kidman plays, is much like Julia and Katya in my photo records. My 3 bridal trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell, so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventure in Russia? However, there is an erroneous impossibility in this movie and that is the way the guy orders his break from a catalog and has her arriving at an airport. It doesn't seem like that at all, so I don't understand why the media likes to continue this. There is not a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way and I challenge anyone to find someone who does. The fact is that you can only book the Russian lady's CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. Then you answer and visit her and if you want to bring her to your country, start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months later. How it works in real life. You can't just order her to get to your airport. US immigration would never allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> - I got everything I wanted by going abroad!
