*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. Everything I almost knew about it was that it would involve Nazi history, underwater scenes and everyone would speak Danish. But I decided to check it out for a reason that history is evolving around a sunken WWII German submarine. I have a fetish for German subs, especially wrecks that can be dived on. So I was a little skeptical about the Danish part, but justified that the bottom could weigh that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always so good and not sure of the budget size, was at least very skeptical. <br /> <br /> Upon viewing, I was surprised. <br /> <I had some thoughts that the actors were insufficient when I saw how some are very young, especially the two main actors. This was not a problem they both perform very well. Like the other actors, mainly composed of people in their 50s and above. This gives some interesting interactions between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not unique in anyway, but something rare. And that's all good. <br /> <br /> With regard to the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was no problem, it had subtitles. Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspect there would be internal shots as well as underwater exterior shoots of the submarine. After deciding their budget was slim, I thought this might prove appropriate at best and down right awful at worst. Again, I was surprised that the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. I had a fetish for German subs, I knew what the bottom should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. The team has done a serious research. It's all good. <br /> <br /> I suppose more people than myself will see this movie just to see some underwater scenes, so I feel I should issue a "warning". The submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. It is a special purpose sub. But to give you a hint of what to expect, it is a cross between a Type VII, Type IX, and a Japanese transport sub that corresponds to I-52. It is God a good design and makes a good wreck. <br /> <br /> The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. It is summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the summer break as they do each year. Their grandfather is a sort of mariner. The kinematics are quite nice, many beautiful summer scenes on the island docks, some new-found teen love, lovely scuba diving and a general sense of "perfect". Once again it is good. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the island gets some visitors of the suspected kind, a collection of men hiring one of the boats, an old minesweep and it's crew. One of the visitors, a man in the fifties, has the German eagle and swastika tattooed on the back. The island's retirees all remember when a German submarine was immersed at the end of 2. World War II, and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold in the depths. Grandfather was one of the young men searching for the sunken submarine shortly after German bodies began floating back in 1945. No submarine was ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy and ... a surprise. *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I didn't expect any of the supernatural elements to appear in this movie and it was discouraged. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, it still fits well into history and poses no problem. It's not like "From dusk to dawn" where everyone turns into vampires towards the end. This is a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: Really good movie, I gave it a 8. Some because of the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that it had a reasonable budget and that some of the actors were seasoned Danish veterans. But even though this had been a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. It was definitely worth it. Yes, a child's story in a way, but again a mature story. It has a lot of excitement and a great aura of adventure that I found very appealing. And again, the cinematography is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
