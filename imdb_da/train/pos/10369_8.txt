"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, joking and incredible though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980 saw a terrible point of view when she saw the 3-month-old baby was brutally taken from their family tent while beating camping at the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the child) was never seen again, and the result of her horrible disappearance created a true life-time all over the world. Meryl Streep makes spotless justice to Lindy, as she always does. But the only thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never falls flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and precise outlook for this baffeling case is tears brought to the eye. The concept is nothing short of scary, and subsequently you are left haunted, but also inspired.
