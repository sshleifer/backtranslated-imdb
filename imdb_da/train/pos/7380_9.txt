The three main characters are very well portrayed, especially Anisio of rock musician was first actor Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as the lower class woodpecker / invader. The film shows very well the snowball effect of being involved in increasingly shady business, contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes. How everyone is carried by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
