This is really a fun show, done in a creepy sort of way, like a Tim Burton movie. It is worth a visit as it is far more creative than most of the shows this season. The best is not a "reality" show. I wonder why the public is so ready to accept shows as such (lacking creativity) and ignoring wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bend. While some decry the premise, I think it's really unusual. Much more fun than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube, when "my name is earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the story and music are wonderful. If you enjoy shows that are a little off the beaten track, I would recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks was, but it has a serious kink for it.
