Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly skilled at this kind of role, where he must portray a sign whose morality is initially uncertain to the public. As is so often the case with Sutherland's characters, we must ask "is he a villian [in this case a smaller one] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently told, of incompetence and timid bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that prevented the highly competent people's efforts. As Sutherland's character says, "The amount of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". The "Committee meeting" (between Rea and Sutherland's signs) after perestroika is enforced, with its revelations, having a tremendous emotional effect. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who worked in that system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes depicting the victims' family members add emotional resonance to the impact of history. This is rarely a feature of a movie with this disease, but reminds us effectively that the victims were alive and loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important movie that deserved its showcase on Canada's history television.
