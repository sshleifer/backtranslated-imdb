I first saw Martin's Day when I was just 10 years old, at home, on The Movie Channel, and still remember the impact it has had on my life. It touched me when no other movie had touched me, and I remember throwing my eyes out. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it elsewhere. I wanted to ask around and no one had ever heard of the movie! I think it was one of the more rare movies that not many people knew about because no one and I mean no one knew what I was talking about. I searched and searched over the years, controlled video store shelves and scanned cable TV lists, but always came up short. Finally I found out in 1996 that I could specifically order it, I did, and I probably have seen it at least 50 times since - and that still makes me cry. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good guy) who longs to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place where he lived by nature, spent time with his dog and stayed alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film he escapes and begins to take his way back to the lake. It is not long before the police find him, and Steckert takes a child as a hostage to convince the police to come back. Soon Steckert and his hostage (2nd Martin) will be best friends and have many fun adventures together - from robbing a toy car to ruling a train, all heading for this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake like a boy. I will not spoil the end for you, but I will tell you that this movie is a must see. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am without a doubt the biggest fan of this movie ever! I managed to find the song that the two Martin sang throughout the movie ("I go back where I come from ...). I even plan a trip to Canada to see the lake and cottage where Martin's Day was filmed. Crazy, I know - but that movie just means so much to me.
