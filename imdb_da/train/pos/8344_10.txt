This is one of my favorites all the time. It's so simple and sweet - surely a chick flick romantic comedy. I like a movie full of good quotes, and it has ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters "Do you think about what I'm thinking" and Ed says "What are the odds for it it happens !" In my opinion, a movie is fabulous if you can see it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it and with this you can !! I also really enjoyed Walter M.'s way of portraying Einstein. I think all the characters fit well together, and the story flows nicely. There are so many times that I smile with the movie and quote my favorite lines as I see it! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys an emotionally romantic comedy every now and then!
