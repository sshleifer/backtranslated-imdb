Every movie Bette Davis star in is worth experiencing. Before Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage", she had been in over a score of movies. Legend has it that Davis was "robbed" by a 1935 Oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress, unlucky mother and manipulative girlfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that AFI comforted Davis by awarding his 1st Oscar to play Joyce Heath in "Dangerous." I imagine Davis' fans of "Of Human Bondage" agreeing with the Oscar-robbing legend will have for my criticism contest of the 1934 movie, for which AFI did not award its achievements and the 1936 film's "Dangerous" performance as she received her 1st Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to see all of Bette Davis's movie footage, TV interviews, videos, World War II commercials, and popular series TV footage. Gradually, it is easy to recognize why this film, "Of Human Bondage," gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25yo when the movie was finished and just about to reach Hollywood's red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in "Of Human Bondage." That's what makes it her legendary performance. But RKO saw her grandeur in "The Man Who Played God", and lent her from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I go with AFI for review, about 41 years after their Stak decision to award Davis his first best actress Oscar for "Dangerous" 2 years later. By doing so, AFI may have helped bring the very best into one of Hollywood's most talented 20th-century actors. Because Davis certainly knew she had to get in on herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue of "Of Human Bondage". Without a doubt she earned more than 2 Oscars; maybe as many as 6. <br/> <br /> "Dangerous" gives an exemplary contrast in Davis's depth of functioning characterization. For it is in "Dangerous" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, she is dead center on the red carpet. Davis is in "Of Human Bondage" just outside the edge, still on the sidewalk and ready to leave for the rest of his 60-year career. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not giving her the legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an actor was given an incentive to reach beyond the star of her soul to the gifted actor's greatest work. It is well known that her contemporary peer opponent was Joan Crawford; a star whose performance still doesn't measure up to Davis'. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is also a radio star 'star'. Lots of people on the stage and the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could feel: the difference between the desire to make a good play or to be starred. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies as I have, watch one after another. Maybe you will recognize what AFI & I did. Davis was on his way to becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo and reached her goal when she was 27. She spent her next 50 plus years putting the bar so high that it has not been reached. . . yet. <br /> <br /> Had AFI sent her the message that she had arrived at "Of Human Bondage," Davis's life story as a great actor may have been brought into the stellar judgment instead.
