Much possibly one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are fun and before you see this I suggest you see "South Park" one of the funniest cartoons created. Buy it, you will laugh every time you see it. Pure brilliant blow. If you don't think it's fun, then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10
