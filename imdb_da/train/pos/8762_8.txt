"What would you do?" is a question that will hold onto your thoughts for weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace. You will also be wondering if Alice (the Danes) told the truth or not - a question that is not resolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly effective and beautifully shot film. Although it is slow at times, its pace reflects the story - but much of the movie will get you on the edge of your seat; Want to know what happens next time. The ending will also let you imagine yourself in the shoes of the protagonists, played brilliantly by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also worthy of praise.
