This movie has so many amazing elements to it! Reese Witherspoon debut performance is of course great, but the same is her chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, soft and clean. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any movie he composes for tenfold. He also seems to have a good chance of lost days of youth films, be sure to get his score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the haunting Gothic music of "The Village". I first saw this movie at about 13 or 14, and now I'm not just crying at the end, I throw a tear or two into nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will end up being a lifetime comfort movie.
