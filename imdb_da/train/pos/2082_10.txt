I first read Pearl S Bucks amazing novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every exciting side of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get it, and considering that it was made in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Certain things must be accepted: in 1937, there was no doubt that Asian actors were cast in a major Hollywood movie. In this way, the end product makes something more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic look. <br /> <br /> With this hurdle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took care of the trouble of hand picking a splendid and starring game. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the peak of his acting as an actor during this period and could almost play something he was thinking about. When you get past the makeup (it's good, but no one really wants to confuse him with a Chinese man), his performance has the entire verisim method of his best work. Then there is Luise Rainer. After an Oscar winner the previous year for her achievements in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Western actress star was on the rise, and she got the role of the O-lan plum despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her another consecutive Oscar, the first time in history to happen. <br /> <br /> Much criticism has been leveled out to Rainer's performance and her Oscar wins here. She has been called wood and a note. There is a small grain of sand in it. However, it is said that all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, but not Chinese, O-lan played pretty much like Buck wrote her; In fact, it's a great achievement, and one of the best book-to-screen transfers I've ever witnessed. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, it was MGM. They had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in Hollywood at the time, and a great budget to pay for the best, and eventually they were the best. <br /> <br /> The movie softens Wang Lung's marriage with O-lan. In the novel, the lust of the flesh comes with wealth, and he assumes a concubine, a feature that destroys his wife, but her feelings as a single woman do not care about him. In the film, an enchanting Wang Lung returns to her wife at her death camp the two gems he had taken from her years before, and realized too late that she was his true love. Corny, yes. But it's Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they were opposed to, the film could well have opened to screams of laughter. But despite the noticeable lack of real Asians in the casting, this film has been surprisingly good with the passage of ninety-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is how good it is when it could easily have been a disaster.
