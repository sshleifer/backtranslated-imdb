This movie is shockingly undervalued on IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it is a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a kind of 8 mile for a female step-dancer than I think you would like it. <br /> <br /> Judging from the IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was "voiced bombed" with many 1's as it happens with so many movies not about the mob , has no special effects or includes non-white or non-equal characters. <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Most noticeable in Toronto, the signals are subtle, and some audiences may think it is set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The signs were light on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree with the title suck. I can't remember anyone in the movie saying these words and it should have a "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). There is not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a voice of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume it's a term of hatred for that kind of people in it and that is sad.
