How can you summarize exactly how emotionally and correctly and touching this movie is ?? For weeks, this DVD jumped from the shelf to me every time I went to the store - after watching Steve Carrell in a couple of movies earlier, I would not smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted until finally I grabbed it with a 'what in hell!' attitude! And how surprised I was! I just wished I had bought it earlier. Having seen it three times in two days, I still smile at how a widow's depiction struggles with three daughters and longs for what is missing since his beloved wife passes, thus encounters an exciting woman, charming her in such a deep And interesting (dare I say bookish?) way, throw a completely different light on life that makes him realize that she is what he has been seeking. <br /> <br /> The choking of the woman who is his brother's girl complicates issues - depicting Dan comic wildly and with a profound chagrin and sees his "someone special" who brings so much fun and pleasure to the family home as well as the lives of his brothers. You just start to feel for him. <br /> <br /> So when the blind date occurs at Ruthie Draper - that's the turning point in Maria's estimation of Dan !! The look she gives him when he repeats his comment, not to like Ruthie - pure Green Eyed Monster! Triggering a completely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This order is one of the most appropriate, as Dan begins to loosen up against Marie. Other gut-wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, faced with his brothers, begins to describe what has just happened .... when Dan's face falls it brings a sharp breath of breath !! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter Lilly makes the present celebrate their love for Suzanne, his late wife brings a warm heart and a little gulp as Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings at the Talent Show .... his voice goes a bit as he represents the song. ... absolute gem! <br /> <br /> The reception of what is happening late in the movie of his daughters ... they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for Marie; The desperation of Dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock, their stronghold ... and tell him so much more than that with just a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future .... but I will end up saying .... <br /> <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie It's just so wonderfully good, with comedies to enlighten the drama that never feels forced or crass that comes across as a true portrayal of a man who discovers new life - Not just with a woman, but also with her extended family, so look no further. <br /> <br /> THEN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-reproduced movie experience with a score from Sondre Lerche, who intimately takes you there all the time, while never being intrusive with fine performances by the ensemble cast. I can't wait to see this again again !!
