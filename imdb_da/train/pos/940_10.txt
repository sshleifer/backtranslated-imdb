OKAY. I'm biased. I live close to Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember them filming here quite alive, and the fake snow on the streets for days. Often when I walk through Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house and it reminds me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott is great and impressive. A man who finds them less than himself is inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most valued works in English. And I don't think there are many cynics who say people are unable to change and redeem. This movie version depicts it all quite beautifully. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays that part of the English miser with wonderful skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version, I strongly encourage you to do so. It's usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you meaningful?
