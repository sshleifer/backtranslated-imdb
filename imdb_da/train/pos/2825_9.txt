This movie was a surprise. I didn't expect much, to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? So what? Probably somewhat rough and with the usual exaggerated fluctuations and facial disorders that low-lying silent films often show. <br /> <br /> Now I was wrong. Greta Garbo should just have shocked the study environments as much as she did to me because this movie made her a star and deserved it. She instinctively understood the power of just standing still or merely holding a meaningful expression for a long time, so that its effect could be felt and not only seen. I continued to think of myself, how did this modern actress enter a creaking silent movie? She was just years and years before her time. The story is not that interesting, it is the usual story of love found and lost. It is only the performance of Garbo like Leonora, the poor countryman who does well in the metropolis and returns to get the man who came away who gives it life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is useful, but his character is never really developed and he is dimmed by the script throughout. At one point he is made to wear Garbo's clothes, rely on a huff, then return and return them. And let's not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garbo and then his wife. Too common, he didn't have much career after this and I can understand why. But he is sufficient as the slightly mystifying object of Leonora's occupation. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic line in this movie that just says it all. "Leonora, you get eye-catching." Yes, eye-catching. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo's gaze as she sits alone in her luxurious car, says everything. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see this again, Garbo is just amazing.
