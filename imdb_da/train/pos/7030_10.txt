We taped this when it was broadcast on television back in 1995 and have been waiting all these years for the release because it quickly became one of our family favorites. The kids are now teenagers and must have seen it a ba-zillion times, but they still see it religiously with friends. It is timeless appeal when in all ages groups - similar to "Fat". Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander lovely and wonderful light on his feet. I have noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provides us with comic relief and wonderful music tracks. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just flat steals the show. Probably our favorite character throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was Chynna Philips' performance of Kim. Part of it has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicated it is Philips delivery flat, imaginative, incredible and just plain horrible. The director should have seen it and corrected it. Or never throw her at first. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is great, and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
