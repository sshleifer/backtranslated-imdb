Garde à Vue should be viewed a number of times to understand the subheadings it contains. If you are not accustomed to French wordy movies based on conversation and battle of wits rather than action, try not to see it. You will only get bored and reassure your opinion that French movies are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a real movie based mainly on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and why Why Maître Martineau (Serrault) intentionally cuts out to be child murder instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he has an 8-year-old sexual relationship. His wife knows it, she is jealous of it, and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still the death penalty) instead of revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his pitiful life.
