This image was banned from American film houses in 1930 due to the nudity of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann) who caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930s, but not so much to the male population. This story is about a young woman named Eva Hermann, who is married to an elderly man and is carried over the threshold of the wedding night, and the man never completes marriage and cares for all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and kills bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain his situation. On a hot summer day, Eva takes a ride on the horse and decides to swim naked in a lake in the forest. Her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns to Eve. These two people become very familiar and there is a romance that begins to flourish. There are many more interesting issues that arise when you watch this movie all the time. Enjoy a great classic movie, which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
