Wow ... I don't know what to say. I only saw seven pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very much in line with the great variety of human emotions. This film was skillfully and beautifully done. Rare to find such an intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it with "Pay It Forward" and "Crash" as far as the exhibition of both light and dark in such a crude way. Certainly hangs with you for a long time and gives you much to think about. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this one. Not usually one for a "bad end" but rather a truth seeker that includes emotions, roles and something more than the subsoil that exists in abundance all around. Therefore, I do not mind a little pain at the end. It is true for life that there are not always happy conclusions. Sometimes it's just not the happy end you think it should be. Many people were able to live happy lives, even though love and a life were lost. If you are a person looking a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
