When Paris burned out, I completely rejected it. I wasn't in the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it should be campy and stupid. How wrong I was about this movie. I saw it after the movie was out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and a place of fun and excitement. I felt I knew all the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular, and the film captured the essence of the homosexual company. What a great job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original cast members did now, but I have not been able to find them all. If anyone has any information about any of the cast members, let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I LOVED IT
