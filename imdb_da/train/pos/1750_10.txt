Well, let me just say something about these actors, they were really a good decision, and from experience, actors really have the dialogue to life. If you go into this even fifteen minutes late, you will be in a shock, the movie will already have begun. You will not miss the first few jokes, provided you miss out on any jokes. <br /> <br /> Wow! I have never seen a movie ending with such a final ending. Not to be hard, I mean, I loved it, but it just surprised me that it really continued until it stopped! But I go before myself, let's start with the start of it when it started. Plot overview goes like this one who is this man and not giving away any spoilers, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he hasn't had any sex ever (!) They use this plot unit to move the story into motion, and there are (intentionally or not it could go somehow) some funny situations had the protagonists, some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses technological advances by combining the film shot of the set and scripted dialogue, some music and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, taking us on a journey from opening credits to the end with a full movie between them. expect to see a fun comedy because of what I already knew about it, and felt that I had just left a theater that just played a fun comedy.
