If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before this ... (is it possible?) ... they probably knew who she was after! <br /> <br /> This show continued to win 5 Emmys, & stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 actions .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra song standards from room to room, full of musicians, including a segment where she is a little girl Again, everyone ends up with a fantastic version of her signature song (at that time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra Sings poverty songs. It's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some good songs like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again" and a "Funny Girl" medley .... All in all, a big part of the TV story, made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
