I just can't understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes it is a typical boy-meeting-girl romance, but it's done with such flair and polish that time just flies by. Henstridge (talk of winning the gene pool lottery!) Is as magnetic and prolonged as ever (who says the movie's golden age is dead?) And Vartan keeps his own. <br /> <br /> There is nucleating chemistry between the two leads; The movie is most alive when they share a scene - lots! It's done so well that you find yourself willing to get along ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you feel a little blue, see this flick, you will feel so much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic, still searching for his princess ...)
