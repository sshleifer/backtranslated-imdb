The early to mid-90s was a highlight in my opinion for the historical drama. The last of Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all portrayed a particular passion and intensity in their respective time periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and exciting taste of a time and place, rarely represented by movies. It really has everything - interesting history, great plays, remarkable dialogue and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed with the seemingly genuine dialogue. I can imagine that this is how early the 18th century people spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle than most found in movies in modern times. The film had a very furious and sexually charged edge for what was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era. The pace was very tight, with almost no dull moment. There were many intrigues and political subplots that complicated things a little, but still did not detract from the main story. The action was also very well done and poignant. Something that I will forever find remarkable is that underneath the highlight activity piece in the movie there is no soundtrack at all. It gives a very exciting and exciting sequence as we have no musical cue about the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always stay high on my favorite movie list. I would recommend it to anyone.
