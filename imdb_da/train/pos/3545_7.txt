Big splashy movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to throw the dice and organize illegal crap games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) will marry him if he gives up craps. He decides on a final game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who plays great, is in town. He asks Sky that he can't get missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to take him to Havana. It may sound like a strange summary, but it's also the movie! <br /> <br /> This is a really mixed bag - there are some wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dance is incredible. The right show stop is at the crap game at the end. Brando is also really good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but he pulls it off. I have to admit seeing great, bulky Brando pulling some tricky dance moves was very fun! Also Sinatra is pretty good, and Blaine is just great as her long-suffering boyfriend. Her song and dance figures are crucial here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she's stuck with a dull colorless role and can't do much about it. The movie is far too long in 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really draw and should have been shortened. Also most of the characters speak in very precise English - contractions are never used. Maybe trying to get out of the gangster's mouth is fun, but I found it crushed and it kept throwing me out of the movie. It is worth catching the songs and dancers, but the long length of it comes to you after a while. I give it a 7.
