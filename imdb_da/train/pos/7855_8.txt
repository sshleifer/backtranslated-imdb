Tess of the Storm Land was a Mary Pickford vehicle I was going to come for some time. I finally found a VHS copy at a reasonable price and had to enjoy it. Mary gives her typical spunky, innocent sexy depiction of a wrong side-of-track girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time is the effort higher: a false murder charge, an illegal child (and consequent cases of erroneous motherhood) and considering suicide. <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford wanted to repeat this. The story is a real moral story, the kind she loved to star in. The controversial issues are not always spelled clearly; a viewer needs to pay attention and get tips on capturing everything that is implied by first impression ?? although everything is more or less explained at last. <br /> <br /> About the only negative remarks I can make would be about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger off Mary, of course!), Escaped in panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab charged against him! Then he cuts it to the top (or perhaps to justify his confusing fear of the dog) that he breaks him to the ground and somehow damages him so much that he still struggles to come up much later as a bad storm hits! This is the same beloved lab sleeping with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hugging Mary! But Maria later throws boiling water into Ben's face, which scarcely slows him down! OK, I've been waiting for Ben and the chocolate lab! Apart from that, the film was quite touching and certainly kept my attention. Pickford's support molding was strong and credible. This is definitely among her better movies.
