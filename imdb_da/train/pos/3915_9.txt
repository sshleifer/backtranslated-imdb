I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time I see it. It is a very convincing version of opera Carmen, with amazing Flamenco dance, just bone set, and of course wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story in a story where everyone parallels the Second until the double tragic end. Of course, a low budget Spanish production, the film features dance by some of Spain's leading flamenco dancers. The combination of the powerful opera music and the dancers' sound boots on the wooden phase makes the story's story even stronger. It is independent film production at the best and probably my all-time favorite foreign movie.
