This film is a good example of good storytelling. The action is amazing. The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or false. There were a couple of points where they probably made people a little more good or bad than they really were, but considering it's a Hollywood movie, they showed amazing restraint. There was not a single explosion shown in the movie, even though they had an opportunity for it. The movie, while having exciting parts, was not made into an action movie. The story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in sadly ordinary times. Well done!
