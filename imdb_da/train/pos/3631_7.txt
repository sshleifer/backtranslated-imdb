The film actually has a pretty good story, but is knocked down in several important places. It's almost as if the director threw the film together without taking the time to make some significant cuts in the movie. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes. This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie. And probably would have been a much better movie if it didn't feel like it was thrown together. <br /> <br />
