I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90s and only recently got the opportunity to see all three parts via Netflix (practical service by the way). All in all, I liked this light-hearted, sometimes genre-challenged mini-series. The story of a younger man who falls to an older woman seems to work, and the actors are all fine. Yes, it has some Romanesque clich√©s to run in the rain or a train station farewell, but the characters have a chance to be explored, so it doesn't look like cheese, just as it would be if Tom Hank's vehicle or the like. Robson Greene, who at times reminds me of a separate birth Scott Bakula does a fine job with someone who is in love with the heels, and ebb and the tide of desire and rejection throws the series into feasible fare. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but it's up to debate I suspect. Apparently there is a sequel and it must arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
