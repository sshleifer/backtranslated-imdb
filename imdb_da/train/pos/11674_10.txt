The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert, it was quite fun to see. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is that Charley fell out of the race relatively quickly after my surprise. When his hands were tender, I expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix, but instead he actually beat the race. The most anxious moment for the show should have been when Max got stuck in the desert with almost no water or food! The finish was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the teams do it. Overall, not as big as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch that you get a look into the world's most challenging race.
