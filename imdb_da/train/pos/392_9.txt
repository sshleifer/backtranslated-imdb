The legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who did not like it did not see the underlying mythology behind the movie. They expected something akin to Star Wars, and it wasn't. Joseph Campbell thinks I would have liked this movie. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average seer might have overlooked. We all have a sword of rock in us. We must all go into our own blood walk once in our lives. We must all face our own insomnia one day. Allowed some of the story was a bit confusing and some of the actions sometimes got a bit hokey, but I think other points in the movie easily made it. I would see it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The Duplicate USA version.) It could have been stupid for the Americans audience who would really have degraded this movie.
