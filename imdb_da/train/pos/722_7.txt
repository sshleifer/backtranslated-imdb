One of the b and c film producer Roger Corman's greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle (originally designated for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically dated story (but would earn extra doses of nostalgia. Given these were the kinds of things that made Napoleon Dynamite characters fun - see Eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n 'roll. <br /> <br /> Students at Vince Lombardi High School meet with opposition from the evil principal, Miss Evelyn Togar (played by cult classic, Mary Woronov), who fears that Rock N 'Roll makes the kids uncontrollable, amoral deviants and promises to make a Rock N 'Roll-free zone. In fact, she intends to wipe out Rock N 'Roll for all students, whether in school or college, and she works with most of the adults who can make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help it. A Ramone's fanatic, she has written some songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School), which she will give to Ramones, and in the attempt to do so, is rejected by Miss Togar, who does everything she can to keep her from going to see ramones playing in the city. It culminates in an ultimate rebellion between the obsolete fun-loving adults and teens (in one end reminiscent of Over Edge, anything). After years of punk, when the celebrities in garage rockers, Ramones (and others) would mark another shift in music development, it was great to watch a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorously exaggerated manner. <br /> <br /> It's mostly mild comedy, but a good emotional comedy anyway, when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (of Airplane Fame) and Joe Dante (of Gremlin's fame), who both participate in some of the instructions, you can get the idea of ​​what kind of humor you are in (and not to mention, expect to see Dick Miller though only for a few minutes in the film's finale). The story will later be inspired (and therefore updated) in the mid-90s comedy, Detroit Rock City, as some minor characters change in the vehicle to aged glam rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend passing the Corey Feldman vehicle, Rock N 'Roll High School forever, released nearly a decade later. The original is still the best.
