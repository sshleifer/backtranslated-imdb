I like it because of my latest personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is limited. The characters in the company really do not enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoy themselves, ie. what they were. The film did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory not only includes romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but destined for the deeper discussion of their values ​​of life. Many films are like this with regard to the discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some kind of them. Before Sunrise treated it in a good way, making the viewer pause and think and adjust the weather and continue watching the movie. Before Sunrise did not attempt to infuse a particular thought into your head. It only encouraged you to think of some problems in everyday life and gave you some alternative options. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical clapping complaints or floating silly ideas. You will still think of these questions for yourself and curious about the next line of history. The end was not quite important. You could get something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be fun. This is an enjoyable movie and worth your time to watch it. I'm also on my way. The film represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
