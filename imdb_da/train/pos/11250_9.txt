When you have just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series at once, you can do nothing but doffs hat - a pure masterpiece, which, compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley, has quite different qualities. <br /> <br /> In minis about Smiley, Alex Guiness, Smiley, steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him. You can say. Here is the ensemble and story that is important as the main player who played excellent Peter Egan in the last episodes is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan only plays a guy named Magnus Pym, who, by lying, being rude and telling people what they like to hear, is very fond of everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech trader. <br /> <br /> Never have the machines behind a spy and / or traitor been told better! Having followed his life from a very young age, we fully understand what makes it possible for him to become a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him "a perfect spy" that his Czech trades call him. <br /> <br /> And by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you've struck it. He rolls on, even though he never gets anything financially out of it, except the promotion of his MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy as long as the flow of faxed information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a non-good king who always dreams of schemes to keep people out of their money. In recent years, his son is going to bail him out again and again. But by the example of his father and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns that lies are the way to survive and does not tell the truth. Initially, he exaggerates a little, but quickly learns to tell the right lies and to be constant and not to change the stories from time to time, to tell those who will listen to themselves and their father. <br /> <br /> His Czech acting Alex, created by Rüdiger Weigang, creates a network of non-existent informants with the help of Magnus, providing the British MI5 with false information for years and years, just as the British did with German spies active in the United Kingdom before and during the war - they continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, settled or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> Young boys playing Magnus in younger years make it wonderful, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, slightly more cynical and tired, Pym played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as it is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to grief or indifference. Actually worth the money!
