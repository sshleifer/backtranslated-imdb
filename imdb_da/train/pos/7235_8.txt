"A Girl's Folly" is a kind of half-comedy, half-mockumentary look at the movie business in the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse of life in an early film studio, where we experience the collection of a set, running through a scene, handling adoring movie fanatics, even lunch at the commissioner. We are also excited about little known movie facts - for example, did you know that "movie actors often do not know the plot of the image they work in"? <br /> <br /> The reason for this movie is basically the movie star Kenneth Driscoll's discovery and romance of a budding young starlet, whom he discovers while recording on-site in the country. I think the 30-minute version I watched was shortened, included on the same tape with Cecil B. De Milles "The Cheat." It is a very credible movie - a light watch with a large cast of extras. As a bonus, it includes some of the best illustrated captions I've ever seen accompanying a silent movie.
