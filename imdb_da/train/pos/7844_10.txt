I really love this show, it's like reading a book, and every chapter makes you feel like more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode and the struggle to try to preserve their friendship over the years. After each episode, it closes a sweet bitter taste in your mouth, knowing that: One - The view was good, you can't wait for the next episode, and it really makes you think about what actually happens to friends in the race of twenty years. And two - the fact that the show is set "on hiatus" and we will not see the show finished at all. Of course, Fox does not know what they have done, they claim they are losing viewers in the 18-49 category, they clearly do not know what people will see if they are releasing a good show like "Reunion". I have a query, even though I would like to travel. If they were to bring the show back and it went to another season, how would it work since each episode is made in a year and history is based on what happens over twenty years? Your answers are very welcome. Bring back Reunion! Bring back Reunion!
