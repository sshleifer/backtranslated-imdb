It was a bit bizarre and bad, and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were also good and complimented each other well. I was sorry to see it cut off. I would have loved to see where it might have gone. You found yourself leaning against the Lucas Buck Sheriff, who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was scary and prolonged. And I would have liked to see more of him and how his character became. However, I want to buy the show just to enjoy it, it was great for something else on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a great mystery about where and what she meant for Lucas. It's a shame it's not still quiet. Or never finished, I would have loved to see what would have happened.
