I've seen this movie many times, and I like that all bad teachers will give it ten out of ten, but feel it would be unfair with other good movies. But I think this is one of the rare gems: a perfect comedy. It is I would venture one of the greatest comic strips of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so sharp that you have to limit the bleeding. The story is well known and is already described in other comments. The two leads provide extraordinary performances, the girls are amazing and the situations are jokingly fun. Not a singing word in sight (note that Hollywood, you don't have to make fun of being fun, you have to be witty) and the move from scene to movie is hassle free. They don't make them any more here. Timeless.
