Okay, so I've come a long way from Houston now, but when I see this movie, I'm back to a little cowgirl's dream of one day riding the bull at Gilleys. (It burned down before I was aged). <br /> <br /> Growing up in East Texas, you know that this movie is a precise portrayal of today's life at that time. If you didn't trust me and watch the movie. Either you want to join the many who love it (and at the same time strangely repulsed), or at least you can make fun of the red throats. (There is plenty of material for poking fun.) This movie does not attempt to be P.C. (what was it in the 80s) or hide the white trash can and it's honest for time and place. <br /> <br /> Must be 10 for me!
