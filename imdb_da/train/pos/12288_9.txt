The sprinkler is a poignant tale of family intimacy, South American politics and super-natural forces. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel to life with all his passion and excitement. In my opinion, this is one of the best films from the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and mellows very credibly, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a great couple fighting for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. Portugal's landscape is a fair replacement for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings of Clara's home and Esteban's ranch are efficient and the period of American cars adds nicely to the post-war period.
