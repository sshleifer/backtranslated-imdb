After watching this movie again, it turned out to be infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times I've seen it. The action is wonderfully wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply amazing as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are just as fine in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful time from the speakers of the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful by the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the finest movies in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! <br /> <br />
