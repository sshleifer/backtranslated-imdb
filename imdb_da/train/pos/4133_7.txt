An incredibly small English movie for so many reasons. First, it is a rare appearance of a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance is not the standard he would last set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is entirely credible as a hoodwinked lawyer. Historically, this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shooting. Being English doesn't have the big budget for the Hollywood movies from the same era, and it often shows, but more interestingly, is that the film filmed just before the war and shows a England that would soon be gone. When we see it today, we think in the form of modern morality and above the fact that this film and its closest American counterpart "It Happened One Night" was on their day when risqu√© as `Fatal Instinct 'was in our time . But after watching and enjoying this movie for the first time, I can't help but feel sad when I see it today. With half the film shooting by 1950 gone, saving the remaining movies means tough choices, and unfortunately movies like this are often transferred to save movies that we all consider important. The color shift, the lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking. This movie along with 'It Happened One Night' is perfect for curling up with a love one under a blanket on a cool evening and watching, or better yet, why not a dual function.
