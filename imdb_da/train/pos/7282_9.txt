This was a very good movie and is quite unfair to judge it without taking into account the time of release. There are some movies that don't get older, but it's clearly outdated. But I watched this movie when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both pictures, as the story was unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this movie as the subject of multiple conversations and meetings, where old boys talked about things we have in common. Therefore, there was a little sense of disappointment and even sadness when we finally had the DVD. First, there was a theory of how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would allow this movie to have something that should be of interest to all the modern filmmakers, especially those focusing on the overdue horror genre. This is the mutilation, the idea that provides coherence in the film; the fact that a human being becomes mutilated creates a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how bad the feeling was when the monster tore Kur's arm out. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctors' neck to take a piece of his veins. Another noteworthy thing is the morbid mood that rides without decay in intensity through all scenes, whether the action is in a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striped dressing room, and so on. May be the reason why it's no longer a good movie is just technical stuff. For example, the accident and the man who saved his fianc√© head could be a more precise work made for another and modern second unit director, interesting. Same thing with all action scenes, including that of Kurt's arm. In addition, something could be done with the monster's makeup. Some remakes have been good; I think in this case an attempt would be worthwhile. Nevertheless, the black and white tones should be preserved.
