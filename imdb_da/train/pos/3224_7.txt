I saw this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a good job with an extremely limited role. Imagine trying to act under these two constraints: you hardly have any dialogue, and because you're playing a hardcore, military robot, you're not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Didn't like asking a diva to perform a great aria while you've gagged and channeled the wallpaper. Despite being verbal and explicit handcuffs, Russell pulls out an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human, despite the limitations. Good work! As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will go down in history as a great portrayal of the complete villain - the one you will love to see the sign and quartet. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and beautiful. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take her eyes off. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is quite standard, with a lot of weaknesses, but as it has a sci-fi cartoon feel, I can't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the valued audience receives a great emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The kind of feeb that believes Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same kind of feeb that missed the whole point.
