Superman and Mole But may be Superman's toughest adventure ever. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to the world's deepest oil well. While some radioactive moths come up through the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople are trying to dispose of the invading mules. Can Superman change people's ways in time to save the pier men? Can Superman warn people about time in relation to the radioactive danger that mules bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Mole, however, are a very intelligent, well-written and well-run movie. Although we will only see Superman fly once short, it still makes a great Superman adventure. One should look for everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
