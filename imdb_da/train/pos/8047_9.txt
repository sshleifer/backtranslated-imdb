I happened upon this movie by chance and I really enjoyed it. Timothy Busfield's character is without redeeming qualities, and at one point, Busfield and Star Meloni are raising women as they pass by ... Meloni's on parade is different from Busfields. Janel Maloney is amazing ... She looks very much like Tea Tea, but the big difference here is that Janel can actually shop. Some very nice things in this movie and worth paying attention when it is on cable.
