I remember this movie. Quite intense for an 11 year old. Good editing, I felt awful for St. Bernard. I would see it again if it was rebroadcast, but the signal goes past Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm just glad I didn't live in this neighborhood. Oh the 70s. What a decade. If they recreated it, I would bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi NJ. The shot with St Bernard was the best and of course the most frightening picture from the movie ... and then they left the carcass on the goat. Rotten children.
