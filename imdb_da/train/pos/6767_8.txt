As a young teenager at that time, Airwolf was obliged to watch a generation who wanted their "cowboys and Indians" to have great gadgets and whiz-bang explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in Heaven: similar cartoon technology, a central character that was essentially a loneliness, and the echo concept of a man making a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was very thematically different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. First, the prize for the series is not based on a desire to help them in distress, but by the Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf in the main selfish grounds (as a leverage to try to find its MIA brother, St. John). And then there is the dark edge offered by basing the series in an 80's war-war context, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy inside. Sure, A-Team constantly referred back to Vietnam and the team's status as refugees, but it was generally done with a light print and was rarely central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the plot was the key to the show's tone and direction - even though this was (inappropriate) diluted when the series continued. <br /> <br /> With the following date, the Cold War setting clearly sets the series, many of the stories are creaking and constructed, and much of what Airwolf does is obviously unlikely even with today's technology. But it's really not the meaning. Airwolf was a rip-roaring fun, trying to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't make sugar canes all by miraculously ensuring no one died. Sometimes it succeeded, but often succeeded successfully - and on a TV budget to start. <br /> <br /> For British readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) has just started (Jan 2008) daily re-releases of Airwolf. Set your Sky + box for this blast from the past - we can even get it re-tooled, re-cast (and, unfortunately, much worse) fourth season, which I never knew before in Britain.
