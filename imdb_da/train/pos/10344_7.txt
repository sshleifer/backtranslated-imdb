Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a 1939 mystery / comedy that is quite good, though forgotten, probably due to the number of amazing films that came out in 1939. < br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented policeman married to his job while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly being postponed. What happens in this movie is no exception - he is called to a murder scene just as he is about to go down the hall again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were great for comedy, worked together well and often, and helped make this battle of gender interests fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are present for excellent support. As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not make much of a woman. Entertaining if a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here threw Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally flowed effortlessly through dozens of movies like the other and the best friend before entering his own movie as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it look easy) who had a Broadway career at the same time as his movie career. He just wasn't cast as a leading man in film or given very challenging roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating notions in "Skin" and "I never sang for my Father" and call him lazy or referring to his smirk.
