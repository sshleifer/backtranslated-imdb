I found this episode to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. The southern park creators have made the best fake of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They have really touched on Romero's underlying social commentary, which he has made with each of his films. I would love to know what George Romero said about this episode. I'm sure it was purely positive! Keep its true vision for its zombie epics intact! Most spoofs deal with the pure gore without the viewer thinking when Romero is trying to deal with his films. I think if a zombie outbreak happened, we could actually worry about our property values ​​before our lives as shown in this episode!
