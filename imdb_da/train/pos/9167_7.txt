This is, in my opinion, much better than any of the 2 1990 versions, but it is still not so good. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it stands out well with other BBC 1980s pieces like Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than any of the 2 90's, and St. John Rivers is at least covered, but not very good. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actor who plays Jane is too old. There is certainly room for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than one teeth used on it.
