* What I like about SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half of the crazy things that will happen to her from now on and not only to her, but to her sister, friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian) , crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you don't 'You must Don't have a fun bone in your body if you only like veeeery sophisticated comedy this is not for you; if you like a fun, sometimes touching show with two hot chicks that can be in the lead (and no one but the amazing 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the headline), what the hell are you waiting for? You are welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I think of you (2002-2006): 8.
