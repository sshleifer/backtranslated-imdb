"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heirs who engaged the son of a poor Marquis, arriving at the family's crumbling castle and learning about a mythical ursine beast claimed to prowl the nearby forest. It is fabled that a former lady in the house (Sirpa Lane) once engaged in pervert with the creature and Lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident. "The Beast" is an art house mix of surreal horror, explicit sleaze and porn. There is implied bestiality, assault and perversion in the priesthood, ample false ejaculation discarded on bare breasts, masturbation with a rose and most graphic of all the eponymous beast toying with incredibly large phallus. At this genuine erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. The women here are amazingly beautiful and they are naked most of the time. Everywhere "La Bête" is a visual celebration. Where it comes from fetishist attention to detail, or the visual motifs that are pregnant with information, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be monitored with care and attention. A must-see for fans of European cult cinema.
