Saw this flick on ENCW last night for the third or fourth time. Enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD. This is really a standout and of course the first of the Mann-Stewart pairings. More here than the usual oater, even though it's not as powerful as The Searchers. Lots of obvious symbolism about getting crew, but mostly it is by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting as a beautiful would be quite interested in Lola, but too yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Kills Liberty Valance, he's virtually reduced to putting an apron and making his enemies coffee. Decaf no doubt. Tony Curtis from the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behave like no Indians I've seen on the screen have interesting cameos. <br /> <br /> Particular performances by John McIntire as an overly-fortunate short trade / gun dealer, hanging out on a very low quality Western version of Rick's American Cafe. No one wants to stay there. Jay C. Flipper in addition to a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some nice scenes with Stewart before coming to the Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer like Wyatt Earp and the Indian chief who takes Walter Brennan off from him in the Red River are pleasant observations. This is the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne or Scott could have pulled off. Well worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
