This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star signing a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in the one that forces Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yes!) Is awarded by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly abiding by the contract. This is a funny movie where Burt shows that he is not too proud. I like it!
