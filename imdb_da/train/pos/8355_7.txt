The film has a distinct (yet brutal and rough) humanity for all its border walking - the zippy / lyrical score points to the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they are most thuggish (like terrorizing the woman on the train), a half-hearted vulnerability deludes never far away (Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby). Being cut off from the scene where Depardieu may be raping Dewaere, so we are never sure how explicit it is to read the obvious homoerotic aspect of their relationship - neither that event is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly read as pro-gay, although it could probably be read as pro-something you want). The film has many offensive scenes and poems in sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon of both sex sensitivity, making an estimate of the whole concept of sensitivity and honesty and hitting many points with possible depths based on the fact that if you turn off enough shots , some of them have to hit.
