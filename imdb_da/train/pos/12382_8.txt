Here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a port of Hell in NYC that just happens to be an old brunt. It looks like there are many gates in hell around, but of course this unresolved model is deciding that she needs some space from her boyfriend / fiance, and then she just happens to choose one that is disguised as a good and reasonably priced apartment. She meets several strange neighbors and even participates in a cat's birthday. After meeting with the real estate agent because she hears strange noises from the night up, she finds out that she and an old priest are being provided as the only tenants. Whoa! So who are all these weird? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins to wander around and finds out that things are not what they think, not by a long shot. This has some decent scary scenes and the idea of ​​the creaking old people who are her "sometimes" neighbors that are different from what they see is pretty exciting. A bit decent and even a parade of less than normal people at the end makes this a decent watch, and although I've seen this many times on television, the unknown DVD version is much better. Not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10
