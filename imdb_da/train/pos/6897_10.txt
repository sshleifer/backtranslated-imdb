It was released in France on DVD several years ago - I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles. Don't be confused with a remake with Penelope Cruz, who gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer who is told by a fortune that he will marry the king's daughter. He goes out to join the army and go to war. However, his love is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I do not want to spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a big loss for moviedom.
