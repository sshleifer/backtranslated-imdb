Just come through to see this version of "Samhain" and although I still like it, it's not like the "rough cut" version I have. If you check the bulletin board, you'll see the director's excuse for this cut-off version, 79 minutes., And he says he had nothing to do with this R-rated trimmed down edit with a brand new screw top. Christian really does not have to get away so much because the basic gore elements still stand up, even though they are very trimmed. This is a shame because it had the potential to be one of the most amazing and best goraf movies this year. It still has pornstars, and they propagate, and some of the extreme gore can at least partially be seen. I'm just glad I got that "red cut" because it's a jewel to a gorehound library. Christian Viel has absolutely the ability and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. Idiots had a near classic in their hands and screwed it up for everyone. "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and mistreated horror movies ever, and too bad gorehounds did not see what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my review based on "work print" by SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The movie runs just over 90 minutes and has no chapter stop. There is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no sound on the dialogue because I think they are meant to be looped later. But most of the movie has sound with sound effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is finished. That's exactly what it says, a "Rough Cut", but the only unknown version of "Samhain" you'll ever see. Reason, because gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some pornstars, but they are just there for the killing and adding some sugar and spice. The story is pretty standard, American tourists on vacation in Ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods. An area that is heavy on folklore involves the old grapes and the celebration of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. (scary) The movie starts with a big dose of doing, as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a terrific gore scene when the guy finds his girl hanging from a rock, with her crying for help. All he sees is her head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulls her up, she has been completely cut in half. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with posts, blood and carved limbs everywhere. We are in the Herschell Gordon Lewis area here guys, except the effects look much more realistic. I just have to skip the story because it's your standard stem and kill plot. <br /> <br /> The next good scene is something to see as the boyfriend of the first killing is taken to a cave like place (TCM-2 thing) and tied to a table. This geek then cuts off all his limbs (without camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his torso on a grill pit, slowly turning over a fire, and the torso has a hard-on (if you can believe the). Yes, very bad taste, rough, cruel, you find the right word, and it will probably also suit. <br /> <br /> Later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everybody is cut from neck to step, and all her postings are drawn into graphic joy, and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, a real turn on him? <br /> <br /> But the best doing scene happens inside the house, and I have to admit this is one of the best doing scenes I've seen. This guy (no matter who) is trapped from behind from a geek and cut into the ass hole. The nerd then puts his hands in and rips out all the boys' posts, the intestines and what the hell is ever there from his asshole. This continues forever, as the guy screams and more and more indards are pulled out across the floor bathroom. This is so extreme, so over the top that I found myself laughing at hell. You will definitely never see this scene on a proper DVD, IMO, along with most of the other really extreme doing scenes. So what to think of all this. Well, though I doubt this movie will ever be released in this unclear presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. Yes, it is a little difficult at first with no soundtracks, a few scenes still to be inserted, and credits that lack names anywhere. But that's what makes this so unique, and I wouldn't act on it right now. Extremely doing, yes yes, extremely extreme doing. This makes "Haute Excitement" like a Disney movie.
