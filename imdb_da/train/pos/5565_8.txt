I am a fan of C&C, going back to their records and liked this movie, but at some point in the mid-1980s on cable TV in San Jose California it was sent with an alternative plot line that destroyed the whole point of the movie. All references to marijuana were replaced by "diamonds". The bag, which "Red" falls to Chong, has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... it's worth $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot where clips of foreigners on a ship were added to observe C&C and talk to each other about getting the diamonds. At the end, instead of "space coke" it's something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and clear that they were trying to make it family / child friendly. It would have been better if the network hadn't sent it at all.
