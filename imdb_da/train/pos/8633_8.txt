Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A counter in a bank is all over him. Then his friend, a writer whose books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he stops. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do just that. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the amount of death (killer / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, it would be a farce. There are many jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a sympathetic amorous villain. Romy Schneider is at her most appealing. Definitely worth a look.
