I found this movie to be very good in all areas. The action was brilliant from all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted in the minute. The reason is interesting, although this film is more for the mind to play between the protagonists and how Catherine continues to write with new ways and phrases for her novels. The setting was also great, and the whole atmosphere of the movie was the mysterious, thriller as masterpiece. Go see this movie now, it deserves better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some flawed horrible reviews about the movie (before it even started) ..... You won't regret it if you go see it .. .
