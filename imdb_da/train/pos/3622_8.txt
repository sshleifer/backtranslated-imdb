I knew I should see this when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was a reason, but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers that comes to terms with aging, weak parents, our own mortality, our children growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought that would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into the trap of the tragedy; It is about what living your dreams mean when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a jar, but he does well, and Rachel Griffiths makes a tiny part like the wife for a thoughtful layered performance. The camera work is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left something that was not necessary. Very fine.
