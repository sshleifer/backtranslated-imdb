Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the movie Black Mask. In this movie, Li Tsui, a refugee from a super soldier program, is seeking to regain humanity, which the program had taken away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires him to solve problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program had fled at the same time as Tsui, but they want to come straight to the world rather than find inner peace. Thus, Tsui becomes the only one that can prevent his former teammates from releasing information that can cost many innocent people their lives. This movie screams across the screen at a huge pace and never lets the audience go. Martial arts are amazing, but because it uses wires, it cannot be appreciated as much as it deserves by the American public. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good actors because they deal with mental as well as physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I'm happy to see that some of Jet Li's movies finally get head stream release in the US and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require (things like duplication and soundtrack) will affect the movie. This is one of Lis's best movies, go out and see it on May 14 when it's released in America.
