Well, after a long wait after seeing a few clips on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I had long been waiting to watch this movie. The reason was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. Sentinel is a lower, creepy movie, although it is a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The play is fine, and there are some really disturbing things like the unpleasant orgy scene with the dead father and the shabby woman in the middle of the orgy who eats cake and laughs. The end is a strange mix of deformed people and cannibals. It is a very strange, campy but in the end I really think a good movie! One of my favorites from the 70's, though it's not very original. It's crazy and extremely scary! Probably one of my favorites all the time. 9.10
