I went through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this movie beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture in 1969. After I actually saw it, I'm not surprised anymore. It was far ahead of its time in terms of style, filmography and flashback use to help develop Joe Bucks character. The most amazing thing for me is the depth of Joe Bucks character in such a short movie. I think Voight caught the naive and the viciousness that was evoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he got the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicited him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if it really is he who has done - or is doing - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise, he may have been typecast after the candidate. Anyway, this is considered a full time big for a reason.
