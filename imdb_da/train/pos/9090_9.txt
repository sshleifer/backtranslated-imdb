The "Hollywood Hotel" is a fast-paced, sparkling, wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from Warners that is unfortunately overlooked. It should be remembered if it is only to give Tinseltown's official theme song - "Hooray for Hollywood." The result of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other pearls, but also the charming "I'm like a fish out of water" and "Silhouetted in the moonlight." The best musical number is "Let it be a lesson to you", where Dick Powell and the company describe the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the eight-ball", a fate that literally moves slowly burning Edgar Kennedy by the number end. The image celebrates Hollywood glamor and punctures it all at once as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicate study leaders. The play includes a sharp big-cap - Allyn Joslyn as a pressure agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's boss, Fritz Feld as an exciting restaurant writer, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as a put-in drive-in manager, Mabel Todd like Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her even goofy father. The "racist" element mentioned in another review is here a ten-second bit, where Herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo-"Gone With the Wind" sequence. It's in questionable taste, but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights of this movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!), Which I think is the only recording on this incredible jazz combo. The "Dark Eyes" sequence goes a little too long and comes in late, but otherwise the "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, well worth your time and certainly a movie that should be considered for DVD publishing.
