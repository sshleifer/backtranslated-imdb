I expected this movie to be a giant 1930's romance. Boy meet girl, they fall in love, boy lose girl, boy wins her back in the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays constructor Eddie with all his usual charisma and evil eyebrows raising. He hides from the police when he bursts into Ruby's (Jean Harlow's) opportunity to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry.She plays hard to come for a while, but a girl can only resist the laugh for so long. The warmth between them is clear and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a harsh job goes bad, and Ruby ends up in a guest house for "troubled girls," she's miserable, and thanks to the ragging that her roommate gives her begins to think Eddie never comes to her. Harlow plays perfectly, the fast talking Ruby. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a special moving scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that seems perfect. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A really sweet romance.
