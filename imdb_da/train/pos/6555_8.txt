I've read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books, and if you're not fancy enough to catch yet, Nancy Drew was the movie of a younger Nancy Drew, not the 18-year-old who doesn't go to school that everyone of The books are about. That was when she was sixteen. So of course she would not be as smart as the one in the book, as she was only in the 10th grade. Apart from that, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and adequate for everyone. It was fun at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a good job. She was articulated, character and sweet. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because of course they weren't old enough to be in a serious relationship they have in the books. It was a sweet, PG movie that I thoroughly enjoyed because, unlike most of my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
