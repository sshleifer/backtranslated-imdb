In this movie, in the year 2022, a lot of people look into the seventies. This is fun at first, but soon the viewer sees how much different the decadent futuristic world is despite the notions, how many things we take for granted can become inaccessible. Characters often interact in a peculiar way, without tact or manners or respect. I think this is intentional, not bad to act. As anyone who experienced the social changes in the 60s and 70s, one must assume that in 2022, an overpopulated city dweller behaves like that. <br /> <br /> I didn't like most of the action scene, except the death of the priest: too cheap even in the seventies. The reason is not too polished. But the big scenes and ideas - like the death of the Sun, the way in which robbers and dead bodies are treated, the "furniture" - outweigh the flaws of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
