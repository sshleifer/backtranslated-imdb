Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-forward low budget sci-fi about the Williams family living in the California desert. They witness a series of events escalating in their level of alienation; apparently they have been trapped in a time chain, where past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of very entertaining special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have each other, a friendly and small little ET who spoils the grandchild and so on. This picture shows a little imagination, if not otherwise. Very good music by Richard Band, who performs special effects from David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and more importantly, a sympathetic family are key assets. It creates a sense of child-like astonishment; It may well be that it is more of a children's shovel (or the children of many of us) who are able to translate any errors in the narrative or presentation. I found it hard to resist; It's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (of "Kingdom of the Spiders" fame) and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
