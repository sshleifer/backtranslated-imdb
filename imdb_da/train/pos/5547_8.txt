Strangler of the Swamp was made by low-cost studio studio PRC and is certainly one of their best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder did not commit him as a ghost of revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to choke his victims, and after several deaths, including the old man driving the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The old man's grandson takes over the ferry himself and falls in love with one of the local men, and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of fog atmospheres, which also makes it very incredible. <br /> <br /> The game includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
