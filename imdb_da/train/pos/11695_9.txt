It's such a good movie! Never mind the low rating here. I really have no idea where it came from, they have to discuss another movie then. Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was so original and charming. I really can't think of anything bad to say about it. Maybe it should be '' your type of thing '', but I saw it with my sister and my mother, and we were all taken by it. <br /> <br /> The action was also very good and it's hard to make in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very exciting and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I've always been very fond of Dougray Scott and found his new '' dark 'role very interesting. It's really terribly difficult to make me like a bad guy, but I had absolutely no problem with that time. Even more, I loved him. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama who also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely see this movie, no doubt about it! Anyone who wants to watch a movie with 80% bloodshed should rent something else, though .. But I think the title is already giving it away. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good work !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
