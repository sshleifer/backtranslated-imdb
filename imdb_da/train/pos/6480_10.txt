This was by far the best war documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrific events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day the soldiers came'. For the last days of the war, when fungal clouds arose over Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series, and I remember well, though it was screened far back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be mandatory to look at as many of the world's children as possible so that the Second World War tragedy is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed, and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
