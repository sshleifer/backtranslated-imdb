Okay, let's get it clear. I'm really not on sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round unit that creates a wormhole. It allows you to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual sci-fi series, but it's not! The reason is set today not in a distant millennium like many other sci-fi series. I find it great. It gives you things, happenings and things you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names for all gadgets. They have some of course, but thanks to O'Neil, who likes to keep simple terminology, there aren't many. <br /> <br /> The series has a good mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy lots of special effects, you won't find it here. They don't use many bad, but a limited amount of well-crafted special effects.
