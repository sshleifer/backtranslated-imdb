This is a fine drama and a good change in the pace of today's more hectic and high films. It is another solid based-on-a-sand store that still means much of it could be done for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know, but I liked the story. The story is about a young man back in the fifties who becomes interested in rocket launch and wants to enter this field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, is doing in this western Virginia city. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, whom I think was exaggerated. I would like a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man still a boy is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring tasks, I think. He likes, like his schoolmates in here. It is great to see cozy children in a modern movie. The other two key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (father's father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher who encourages him all the time.) The cinematography is decent, the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I want more of these kinds of movies made today.
