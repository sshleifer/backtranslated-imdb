What a lovely heart-warming television movie. The story tells of a little five-year-old girl who has lost her father and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very concerned. Only a miracle can relieve their dissatisfaction. As all viewers hope will realize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the little girl's mum as she was as a nanny in "Jack and Sarah", worth seeing if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; years tear smoking film! Ellen Burstyn, as always, is a lovely grandmother in this tender and beautifully recorded film. Jodelle Ferland (the little five-year-old) is charming and a most convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the human kindness milk that is clearly illustrated and clearly still around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" gives us all hope by realizing that there are many wonderful people in the world many love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
