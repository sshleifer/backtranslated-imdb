First time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie we saw it to Alex Winter of "Bill & Ted's" fame. We didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about. <br /> <br /> When the film was over, we knew it was love at first sight. This movie, but not quite historically accurate, was and is the best of its genre. I have seen other films depicting the story of this famous summer, and in my opinion none of the others can compare. It touched on some details, but these parts did not detract from the sheer elegance and romance of history. I've seen the other movies this summer, and I find most of them to be good, but no one as captivating as this one. "Haunted Summer" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and settings seem to be something you could find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the wall of an eccentric home. The costumes were beautiful, and despite the fact that they were not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I wanted to find a nail stress to create such a dress for myself. The whole movie was put on the picturesque lake of Geneva (where I hope one day is due to watch this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> In addition to the tranquility of all escapes from England's hard judgments, this film shows the stranger who also surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice at that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And the admission of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was both medical and recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pain in a lumpy foot. It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong substances that were in their possession during the summer. And they were poets at a time when the experience was the key. There was no time for careful caution. Passion and experience was a big part of the romantic time. And out of the minds and discussions of science came religion and philosophy for the creation of a legend: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at the time) played by beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is the control factor for everything that goes on until she also gives experience. But she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. Like the strength she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actors in this were perfect for the parts they played. The music fits. The direction captured the essence of the summer that I have read about it. This film was based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story from what she could put together from Mary Godwin Shelley's current magazines and the other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even the small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the Gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the monster who today teaches us the moral of "playing God". A certain must see movie!
