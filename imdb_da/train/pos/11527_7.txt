Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940's biopic by Mrs Leslie Carter, who also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains provide amazing performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really made us feel like Mrs Carter. Rains is great as the flamboyant selfish producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the big names in theater. <br /> <br /> Though Mrs Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, served as an advisor on this movie, it is a poor representation of Mrs Carter's real events. True, there was a very public and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly regarded as an outrageous character for it and for becoming an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody. When she broke down with Belasco, she didn't go back to him and actually started working in vaudeville and actually made some movies at the end of her life. She actually married Lou, and he became his leading man in many productions. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, driven by Mrs. Carter regains the custody of her son, she finally recognizes that in her time away from him, he is thoroughly tied to his father. Also in the movie (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical guest house, giving the film some extra interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a portrayal of the magnitude of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments were in the heart of Maryland, where she had a six-foot threesome wig. Off-stage fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage, clapping in the middle of a bell to keep it from ringing. Completely visual.
