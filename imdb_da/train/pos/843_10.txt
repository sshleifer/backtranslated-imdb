Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when did he really be bad? I think this movie is incredibly undervalued! The use of colors in this film is something very different in today's movie world, where every other movie has Payback blue filter. I also love the way they used the song of Asia. To prove that even what was once thought of as a bit cheesy can be really cool placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I made my first feature when this came out. Being my movie was a hit-man movie, I had to check something in the genre that was released. After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my movie got on IMDb that it would recommend this movie if you liked mine. How any of the others relate, I have no idea, making an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
