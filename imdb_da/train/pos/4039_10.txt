Most complaints I've heard about this movie really come to one thing: It's not Versus. Yes, the castrator and the crew are pretty much the same. Yes, Kitamura rehashes a couple of shots in battle scenes that come in the second half of the movie, but it's about where the similarities end. Versus takes place mainly outside and shows Kitamura's ability to make an interesting B movie in natural places. For Alive, almost everything is happening inside. In small, narrow spaces. Here the art design is printed into your face, and WHAT art design is it! We are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to these rooms. Another important difference is that we do not get much action here until the end of the film. Versus was about action and cool, here put much more emphasis on character and situation and crush with your mind. Because of this, Alive is a much more interesting movie than Versus. Don't pop it in and go to a random scene to see five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed, but you'll be glued to the screen for almost two hours and see him interacting with a couple of genuinely interesting characters. <br /> I'm now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You should too! But be sure to realize that this is another animal from Versus - it is often slow and requires a little thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters choose it for subtitle R1 DVD release!
