For a while I was caught in the trap, where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives Bus is the exception. It's the truth. It's the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> The "slime" of this movie seems to come naturally. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an undamaged man in a gem and a store dress. It takes the eccentric couple trying to kill each other to always walk down the stairs. Jesus goes to a funk soundtrack. Anyways gives Fatty the impression that someone lost their mandate to advise a senior film project. But it is the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression the decision makers knew it would be bad, but never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never be duplicated strangely, delivering Fatty. Highly recommended.
