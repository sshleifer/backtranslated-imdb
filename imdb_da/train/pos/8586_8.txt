Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It has been a long time since you performed in a movie, and what a movie was, it was 24 no, but very exciting, especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the champion Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's character is the one who chases Michael Douglas the whole movie, "Kiefer's partner," is Eva Longoria, the desperate housewife. wow she can actually act in addition to flirting all day and look good, though I want Kim Bassinger to have a bigger role, but apart from that, I really think the whole movie was a blow from start to finish. This movie is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone played their part in the hilt. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie, to keep you guessing at all times. and I really think that Kiefer did a lot of work here in this movie, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had today's tricky performance, thumbs up.
