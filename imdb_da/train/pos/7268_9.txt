With all that happens in the world, we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; but it is not without content. There are more than furious acts or heartwarming dramas. There are the charming little shows you can see with your kids and have enough fabric to enjoy with your date. Try it, you like it more than you think. The little girl is really smart and sweet. "Papa" and the girl go through some slapstick routines. When a jealous boyfriend enters, the pier breaks the curl and the known life ships can be torn down. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles like the upper crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable as a duo that exhibits street homeless homeless operators. Their worlds collide and comedies follow.
