Hi, I was alanrick maniac. I'm still crazy-holic. It was just another movie I saw on television. Then I had to get the videotape to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD because the tape showed the first sign of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Look at several movie posters and movie script. Right now, it's getting so worse that I'm trying to push other people into addiction to my site and still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could that happen? What led me to addiction? OK, it is one of the fun, but somehow sad and melancholy intelligent comedies that only the British can produce. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is worlds apart from things like '' This Is Spinal Tap '', because of the characters that are not childish or ultra cool but real. This is a story that men are getting older too. A story about men getting together with each other. Or not. It contains some of the best actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy puts on one of the best shows I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Foreigners Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays the baseball player Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, who portrays the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms, really sings. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy's song in "Love Actually", you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Now you will fever for each scene to get to the x-th time, especially the concert scenes. You will die to really stand in the crowd when Strange Fruit does "Over The World", sings at the top of your lungs. You yearn to cry and celebrate with thousands of people rebirth of the real weird fruit at Wisbech's festival stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to strange fruit. If there is a world where this band really exists, I'd like to move there. <br /> <br /> Are you still crazy ... anyone?
