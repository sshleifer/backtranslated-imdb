Although John Woo is heavily cooked, my number 1 favorite is movie. But I have to say the police story is my number 2 favorite movie. I say this because stunts, matches and action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps out of the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall walking on a pole surrounded by Chrisma's light and sliding down the pole dropped through a skylight and finally landing on the back of the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS new line home video. Any questions or comments are welcome to reply. (I'm only 14, but I know where to find any movies ever made.) If you look anywhere for a movie and can't find it, please reply to me. Thanks and good night!
