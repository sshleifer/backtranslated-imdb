Super Speedway makes a great demonstration of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, crossing different high speed tracks reminiscent of the driving sequences of the Grand Prix (if only shown on DVD!). I enjoy watching it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The only minus and why I didn't give it a 10, some of the driving sequences look suspiciously as if the movie was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a small suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes as you go under bridges.
