This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to both children and adults. Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and seeing Robin's next exploitation. We can't wait for the next episode to fly every week and are happy for the free "On Demand" view. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a place of current fashion. There is a morality for every story. It's entertaining. Violence is not over-the-top or superfluous. The soundtrack is amazing with a John Williams feel to it. It is an old world narrative that is brought to life again with a new world flair. There is so much garbage on TV from the brain rotting "reality" TV to meaningless violence. You should take it for what it is and it is an updated "Robin Hood" that should not be compared to Errol Flyn's film performance. This is a gem to be enjoyed by everyone. Parents who are worried that their children are seeing too much violence will enjoy Robin's losing her taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who would rather try to justify his way out of a dispute than fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Instead of standing by and not doing anything, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being "Night Watchman". The Sheriff of Nottingham is delighted with the supreme evil, just as the Sheriff should be and resembles a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely nice actor, one that makes most women want him to not portray the role of a bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where's Friar Tuck?"
