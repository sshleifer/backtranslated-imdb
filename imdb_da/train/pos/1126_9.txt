My interest was raised when I ran through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought OK, let's see what this is. I'm so glad I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the top, but a wonderful time to be. I look at this, and it makes me sad for everything the hard movie industry is putting out and these beautiful little beads are being passed on. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slowly but the drama is built up and you are drawn into the story. Seeing this lovely movie made me pay homage to more Greek tragedy and pathos.
