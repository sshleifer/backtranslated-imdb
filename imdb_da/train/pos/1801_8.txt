I watched this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it so much and I do it now. But what I realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a G-rated movie, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds singing voice fits a junkyard dog. There are some good songs right from upbeat ("Let's make music together") to even emotional ("home to my heart"). I found the plot good even though it involves a key once or twice. The final scene in the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the most horrific I have ever seen in animation. A movie worth experiencing.
