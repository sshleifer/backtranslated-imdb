I just watched the 6 episodes on DVD. The action throughout is excellent - no doubt. There wasn't enough action for me to say. No real excitement as such, just lots of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in the form of "whodunnit". If you like a good story slowly and carefully, then it is for you. Peter Egan as leading Magnus Pym is excellent. <br /> <br /> The film portrayed a traitor's life. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British intelligence service but who was so injured psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his lifestyle in all things. As a child, he loved his father, but his father was time and time again as a villain and a king. Pym did not fail for ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is badly damaged by his father's influence - it has eaten its moral fiber away. He has no true love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Strong psychological things and not many bright moments in the 6 hour series. Very well done though.
