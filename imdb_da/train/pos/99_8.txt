A Christmas together actually came before my time, but I grew up at John Denver and the songs from this particular were always my family's Christmas music. For years, we had a crackling cassette made of a record that meant it was Christmas. Some years ago, I was finally able to track a video of it on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for 21 years, I got to see John and Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance, it's great fun - good music, heart warming and cheesy. It is also interesting to see the 70's versions of Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I think Denver actually took some warmth to make a show like this - I usually think that artists do not compromise their photos to make sing-a-longs with Muppets, but I'm glad he did it. Although you cannot track the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.
