I started watching the show from the first season, and at first I was pretty skeptical about it. The original movie was a little childish, and I was just looking for a sci-fi show while waiting for BSG's new season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I have loved the characters - it is not as stupid as you think he is Jack O'Neill, the not-only-wise Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, women and children, favorite and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but it is mostly not about technology or space struggle. It's about helping your friend, even risking his life. It's about "we leave nobody back". Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all good qualities that make a human - Human. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking a record, going tenth time and still doing well.
