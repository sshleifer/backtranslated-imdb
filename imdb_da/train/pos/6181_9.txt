A very enjoyable movie that allows you to see old musicals / mysteries. It can't get close to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man's mysteries like a movie noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's put on a show" backstage musical. As a musical, it is not Busby Berkley or Freed device, but it can increase the classic "Coctails for two" and the nice "Sweet Marijuana". The movie runs in real time during a stage show that opens the night for "Vanities" where a murder - and soon another - is discovered backstage. Is the killer found before the curtain falls? Of course, though, the search is fun, although it is a little predictable and horrified by outbreaks of comic relief (fortunately in the form of the clever goddess of the Toby Wing corpses). The stupid policeman is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is just a little too sympathetic, the leading lady a bit too gracious, the bitchy prima donna bit too bitchy, and the enamored waif a little too self-sacrificing, but that stereotypes go, they are pretty stylish. There is a wealth of really beautiful choir girls that are even better selected than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period, which sometimes tends to be a little on the plump side. Yes, this movie could have been much better than it is, and the Duke Ellington number is embarrassing, but if you enjoy diving into old movies, it will turn out to be an incredibly exciting ride.
