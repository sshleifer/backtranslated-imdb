I watched this movie with my family and it was amazing! This movie is more than just a documentary (no more than cold facts) with long mono / duologists and lots of charts ... The complete "power" of this movie comes from the impressive images filmed underwater in air or the Arctic. By watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than by reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life. This movie is not just for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to watch a good movie with a message should see it. This film taught me that we are not just living on the earth ... we live with and through the earth, and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
