This, along with "Hare Tonic" stands as one of the best Bugs cartoons, actually one of the best Bugs ever. There are some comments on how errors in these cartoons are "basic", which means I'm probably not fully developed. In fact, I prefer this "basic" mid-40s version (Chuck Jones' was the best version), actually more rabbit sizes and much more entertaining than the final legged version that towed over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The last few days the bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated to my liking. See also "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for good examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
