In the Hollywood West, these trolls were a hard bunch, as when they came to town, partying was pretty hardy. After all the trail driving was a lonely business back the day before the railways came to all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> The drivers working for Chief of Staff Gil Favor as played by Eric Fleming were no different. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that regulators stayed with it for the most part, we got to know all the drivers at some point. A few point history lines were focused on all of them, although bulk was with Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Rowdy Yates, the number 2 guy with the crew. Clint Eastwood's western image was cast by Rawhide, it is a shame that these are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. Had this been an NBC show, it would have been done in color as Bonanza and run as often as they show up. We wanted to see much more of a man who became a movement legend. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the show before closing to make movies. He made a couple of them and hoped the show would give him a bankable movie name. Unfortunately, he was killed on a movie placement that made an action movie drowned in a river. Had he lived, he could have become a name like Eastwoods. <br /> <br /> Last season, Clint took over as a trail manager and then the show ended. And of course he became the icon he is today and not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it. No frills in this one, these worked cowboys just by doing a job and struggling with the elements and regardless of the situations they were thrown into each year. They really don't do TV shows like these anymore. What a shame.
