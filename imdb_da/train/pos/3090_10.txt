I'm so sorry that ABC is giving up another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and story was great, an actual original idea for a show rather than another boring reality show. Castings were spectacular! Not only were the characters and the actors right on, but it is a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us sharing this whole idea of ​​"connections". I really love the characters Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those who only had a few episodes (eg Sheri Appleby). The actors and characters are so easy to suffer and so talented !!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show midway, also it was not advertised enough. Really unfair !! for all!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please be with me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want the last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!!
