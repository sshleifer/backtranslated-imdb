I found the film quite expressive, the way the protagonist had been lost, but more aware of certain things in life than people who scoffed at him (his flatmate for example). He was tortured and you loved seeing him tortured! it had this perverted side, which was scary but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again. <br /> <br /> It was like a game character or pan-man through a mining country or enemy and we love to see him under sniper or fire, but at the end we are happy to see him survive ... <br /> <br />.
