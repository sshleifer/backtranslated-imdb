I chose this movie based on the plot collection and the critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign films, and didn't know what to expect. I don't care about subtitles. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, gracious quality that allows you to feel comfortable in life. I found myself living loudly loudly repeatedly. I would recommend this picture to anyone, even those who cut off foreign films with subtitles. This makes it worthwhile.
