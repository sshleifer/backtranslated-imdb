In Manhattan, American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and a bathroom-only apartment. Jim works in an advertising agency that raises $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment because of the lack of space. When he sees an ad of a great house for sale in Connecticut at an affordable price, he drives his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house and the man tells him to put the house and build another. Jim checks the information with other engineers, and everyone condemns the place and before he finds that he bought a "pittance" instead of a dream home. "Mr. Blandings Builds His Own House" is an extremely fun comedy with witty lines and top-notch manuscripts. Cary Grant is fun in the role of a man moved by the impulse to perform with the American dream of owning a large house that finds the bad choice while losing touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very fun movie that was visibly inspired by this lovely classic, "The Money Pit". My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
