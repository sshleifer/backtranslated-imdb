It should be against the law not to experience this extremely fun stand-up show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like that. <br /> <br /> For nearly 70 minutes, Murphy continues on dicks, pussies, breasts and persecutions as many famous people, including his own "family". Among the people who get it by murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have never seriously learned so much from anything my whole life. I mean when someone does not know who Mr. T is, but still laughs at Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. At that time, I saw the show, I couldn't remember who Mr. T. was, but still laughed. Now I know who he is and it just makes it so much more fun. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make these impressions so good that it doesn't matter where the hell he's trying to do, it's still fun. And besides that, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please see it ..
