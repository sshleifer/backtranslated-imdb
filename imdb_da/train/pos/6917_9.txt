This is a story about Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "The Gun That Won The West" To cowman, ban, peace officer or soldier, Winchester 73 was a worthy possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own one ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo who would continue to create a race of superior western who added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursues the man who killed his father. Riding into Dodge City with his faithful friend, Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}, the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the city, both men can't get the shoot they're ready for. The men instead squared into a contest to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a contest that Lin finally wins. But before he can leave the city with the grand prize, Dutch hangs on him, steals the rifle and jumps quickly around the city. As Lin sets out to hate the pursuit of both husband and rifle, the rifle will change hands a number of times, each time adding another dimension as the billing day for all approaches. Benchmark for what became known as the so-called "Psychological Western", Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man who is driven to border disputes by an event in his past. Tho shot in black and white {the only of the duo westerns was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feast for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in the silhouette amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City. It's just the starting point that will see Mann use his prospects as a way to run alongside his characters emotional states. <br /> <br /> Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances, such as McAdam, for once and for all that he was one of America's finest and most versatile players. The support support is also not bad. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only female among machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the ever-great Dan Duryea add further class to the case. There are even small parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who had the script ready to run. But Lang went away from it, something that turned out to be a blessing to Western fans. For as great as a director as Lang was, with Man directing {and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands} set the wheels in motion to change the genre. Not only with the additional efforts Mann & Stewart produced, but also in whom they influenced. As Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took all the notes and pleasing to the western purists, they followed and brought the psychological torch even further. <br /> <br /> A big hit at the cashier back at release, Winchester 73 is a grand movie that still packs a blow in the modern age. 9.5 / 10
