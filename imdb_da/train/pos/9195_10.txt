I don't give a movie or show ten very often, but this show touched a nerve in a way that no other show has. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and thought the premise was so interesting so I took a look. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story remains on the supply side, as the protagonists move through the scenes. Sumy Iwaya, played carefully by Koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to keep problems from appearing. No one really wants to put their soul out in front of a perspective companion. So instead, she replaces a human being played by a sweet Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. The difference; He can reciprocate in the same way, after all, Momo is a man, not a dog. Being treated as a pet, he responds to situations in which a dog can react. She spends time with the new girlfriend, Momo becomes jealous. It is when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet that the sexual tension between the two begins to become thick - Momo is a dancer. Her thinking changes slowly as we begin to get a glimpse of his own thoughts. Matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one-dimensional in the beginning to two-dimensional when we see he is a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall to his master as a man, not as a dog. In my opinion, it is worth seeing this story to see this character evolve. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness, you almost want to wish you also had one. Neither will think of the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy) states ?? We both knew this was not able to last. See this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
