I first saw this movie many years ago and have continued to see it several times a year when I have an opportunity. It's on my favorite movie list along with some of the classics. Should anyone tell you it's foolish or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. The dance is not as important in this movie as in other Astaire movies, so the comedy and the play are shining through. Watch this movie if you can, it can be light, but it's still quite entertaining. So I know many people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can't really be fun, this movie has to make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He can be a fantastic performer and talented singer, but it's just not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of history. Comedy turns into a bit of clich√© at times, but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are just perfect for the play and can satisfy anyone looking for some light laughs. Give this movie a chance, even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in anyone.
