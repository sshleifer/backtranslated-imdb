I enjoyed this movie, given it's primarily because I enjoy watching Sean Connery act and this one has the added bonus of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it too. The story has a grandmother seeking Connery's help because her grandson is in prison, and she says he was mistakenly convicted. Initially, it seems that there may have been some racist aspects of the case, but it turns out later that the head officer on the case was black himself and it seems that he did some pretty bad things to force a confession out of the boy. Now the boy is trying to point to another murderer who is locked up in the same prison, one being killed. He is also a very scary person as he takes much pleasure in what he did, wrote his victims to his parents and tried to get people to send them. A lot of phrases in this one with some of it is something unexpected. I just enjoy Sean Connery's character trying to make sense of the whole trial. The film also made me angry in areas, especially when you find out what ultimately happened. You get very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, as they all shine quite well in this. Finally, this gives a pretty good tension / thriller.
