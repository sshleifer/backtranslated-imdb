This type of film about young teens struggling with their own sexuality was somewhat unique and bold and bold a few years ago, but more and more movies like this were made over the last few years, making it difficult for the movies to still separate get out. <br /> <br /> Also, this film received little advertising, except for the usual small-film festivals that featured this little French film, as well as the major festivals that are always fond of this type of small-scale film about everyday issues that are not being addressed. often in movies. The movie premiered in Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards too. <br /> <br /> The film does not really stand out from others, as it actually contains a little bit new when you have already seen similar movies like this, but this does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad to see. The film is definitely a good watch that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore effectively, in a typically slightly slow French cinematic pace. <br /> <br /> It's a forthcoming movie that focuses on life for mainly 3 completely different mid-teenagers. Sexuality is a major theme in the film, which is handled delicately and subtly. It makes the film and its history generally quite realistic, but perhaps a little predictable, as the film does not give anything quite original enough in its genre. This type of French film will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason they probably expect it to be very artificial, with deep layers and meanings for it. However, "Naissance des pieuvres" is a very accessible movie for everyone, and you really don't have to be in Euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. It is a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie because of its subject and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistic by its actors who have not had and have extensive experience in film business, but are authentic looks and feelings within their roles. The strong individual characters give the film some cozy themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie on his subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
