Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your standard problematic predator who has got his nickname because it doesn't matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counts), he never stops after the evil ones. <Br /> <br /> When a pioneering American tank named "Thunderblast" is driven across the border into Mexico, it is the nabbed of revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and the Libyan colonel (Henry Silva) which is adapted to Russian villains. The army personnel involved are held as prisoners, among them Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who happens to be McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey must not have the physical presence of say, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another suitable manager for a movie of this type, but he is a blast as a confident guy who is quick with wisecracks. Fly aging is a large female pencil; She doesn't just look incredibly sexy, but makes it a great game. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and it always welcome William Smith (as a Russian lead) is noisy foam in the classic action movie tradition. The support supports are quite full of well-known and reliable character players: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman delivers the manuscript based on a story from Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. It's the kind of script where you just know the authors have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy and just having fun throwing credibility out of the window. Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of shots, explosions and general all-out mayhem. "Bulletproof" is fun for the action fan who doesn't mind turning off their brains every now and then and just enjoys a generous assortment of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
