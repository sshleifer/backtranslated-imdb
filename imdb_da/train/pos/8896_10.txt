Can anyone help find out the title and artist of the song that was played at least halfway through the movie. I can't remember which scene was playing. The words in the song are of a ballad. Some of the texts go like "It's nature's way of telling you something wrong." It is nature's way of telling it in a song. "" It is nature's way of forgiving you. "Help me with this question. Thank you so much! I have been searching the internet for several days, I can't get this song out of my mind. So now this will challenge me to find some out there who can help to help more with this case, I wish I would have been aware of the scene when it played.
