Note that I didn't say it's better ... just fun. The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving. I was actually surprised that this was not a Troma movie, as it has all the Troma brands, including spitting acidic liquids, wisecracks from villain after every murder, a ridiculous rape situation (which is difficult to disturb as rape is a snowman) and stupid deputies. There is much to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who is noted that he does not have legs or feet, drives a police breaker around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Although it should be close (or below) freezing, there is no breath and there is no sign of car exhaust when cars are driving. <br /> <br /> 3. The snow reminds you of more of flocking or Styrofoam peanuts than actually snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl gets hots to her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is cruelly murdered. She talks about breaking into the sheriff's house in all places to get it on. But first she tells him to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After adolescence, Jake's head is cut by a sleigh runner, his father argues with the sheriff whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. The sheriff claims that Tommy would not have fought with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet higher than Tommy." At that moment someone complains in the background in "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt away, the sheriff breaks a flat snowman made of some kind of fabric for a long time. This is much better than Tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have been able to keep a straight face at this time. All in all, a funny movie. There is not even so much blood.
