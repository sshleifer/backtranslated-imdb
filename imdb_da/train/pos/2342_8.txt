I looked at Pie-light last night, and the word that comes to mind is "original". It is a word that is not widely used in television, as they all tend to copy what the other network does and you end up with seven nights of crimes, unfunny comedies and reality crap. The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British "Carry On ..." series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I have to set more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead in a moment. He made with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve murder using this talent. Everything is fine and fun until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The dream begins, Timeline) and things become really complicated. He can't send her back, and he can never touch her. Boy, would it make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I want to be tuning in to see where this series is expecting it to continue to entertain.
