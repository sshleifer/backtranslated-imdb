This is Neil Simon's job that has many praises! "The Odd Couple" is one of a kind gem that lies inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, pushy freak freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slob. However, these men have good jobs. Felix is ​​a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced, Felix is ​​a wife nearby, while Oscar is across the United States (The West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living in one roof together without driving each other are evil and unlikely. It's a lot of laughs and a lot of fun. I liked the part when the two British neighbors talking to both gentlemen, and after Oscar kicked Felix, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to eat dinner with them the night before. It's time Felix needed to light up. I guess all nice freaks nicely look up. They can be fussy, but they must also be patient. A very funny movie and a nuevo classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a must see classic movie. 5 stars!
