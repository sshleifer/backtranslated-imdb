It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically, I assume that it is a comedy about an inactive rich drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl whom he will marry as he risks being pampered by his family. <br /> <br /> It has fun moments, romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is fun and makes her self-centered character attractive, Liza Minelli is a compelling foil like the feisty opposite he attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It is corny but fun with a memorable soundtrack and ran for almost 3 months at our local fleapit.
