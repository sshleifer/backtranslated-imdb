Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", crying at the end (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60s. I also wondered why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was only given a 7.0 rating of imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Now I looked at the collapse of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave a 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users actually pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I owed this very unusual reconciliation pattern (a sudden increase of 1 characters, with a high 10 rating, only gradually declining and then suddenly reversing and jumping at 1 rating level) at only one things: hate for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have voted in enough chat rooms to see the toddlers of young people (young men, mostly) accusing him left and right. They absolutely hate the man and they will have no role in giving him any credit in the "Titanic". (To answer another user: I am NOT talking about anyone who just doesn't really like the movie and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has and is entitled to their own taste. But no one can convince me the imdb value of only 7.0 overall for the "Titanic", drawn to the level of an immense number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall movie image.) <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user mood pattern "Titanic" to 5 randomly selected cash registers and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will show me). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was pulled from theaters quickly after a very poor picture office, and the imdb voters' rating was: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT DOES ALL THESE MOVIES JOIN "TITANIC"? ALL PERCENTS OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE DOWN! Than "titanic" and none of these stinkers were ever mentioned for a single price. Again the "Titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare it to the other 5 movies I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any explanation other than hate for Leo factor? <br /> <br />
