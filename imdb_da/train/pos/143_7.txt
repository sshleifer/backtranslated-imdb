Kingdom II is a good successor, but not quite as good as the first. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first. There is much more comedy in this good. <br /> <br /> We are back at Rigshospitalet, the Danish hospital. Mrs. Drusse should just leave the hospital when her work is finished, but fate will have it otherwise. She soon chases ghosts, and Helmer makes everyone crazy, and it soon gets worse when black forces are solved in the kingdom. This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. In all respects a lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less seriously. The story has kept many elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of stupid, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some additions to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's an odd story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show to keep it serious and keep it right is not an easy job. Nevertheless, these actors handle this situation completely. <br /> <br /> Many of the good qualities of the first series are kept intact. The cinematography is one of those qualities. The handheld camera, which made Trier world-famous, brings excitement and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters, and Trier makes use of these abilities. Good movement, good lightning and good composition and editing make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Prepare to see better effect in this sequel as in the first. Also be prepared to see more. I didn't think green stuff looked too good. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. Nevertheless, the effects as the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects also look good. Little brother just looks really weird, but you accept it. All in all, I would say that effects are from OK to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also pretty good. Moody and nice. Some of it is really touching. It fits really well. First, there is little music in the action scenes and it works very well. All of this makes this a good successor. If you had seen the kingdom you could see this without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before they see this. These two are a series you will not miss.
