A hit at the time, but now better categorized as an Australian cult film. The humor is wide, uninhibited and in the last scene where a BBC studio fire goes out by urinating on it, raw. Contains almost all the clichés about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to 'the old country', and each cliché about the rapacious, stuck, whinging, Tory Brits. Would be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well-known actors and to the Australians of the generation who can "get" humor. Americans - forget it. The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English, and as such it will be incomprehensible.
