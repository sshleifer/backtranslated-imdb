I just watched this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a tragic love story indeed! I really appreciated the fact that in the heart of history the guy lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving a person who is physically disabled. The love that developed between the character and the woman who comes into his life pointed out how I would like love to heal the heart of others. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie ... was great as the woman so full of life that she is able to revive this guy's heart. Unfortunately, as his family is wealthy and her is not, "develops". <br /> <br /> Sometimes it plays on HBO sometimes this month.
