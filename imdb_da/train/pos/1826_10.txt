I loved this movie when I was a kid. Today at 5 pm it is one of my all-time favorite animated movies. Beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things you like about this movie. Although many people may not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well finished and go along with the story. It focuses on Charlie, a roguish, beautiful German Shepard, who might seem unlikely to some first ... but ultimately will win you over. <br /> <br /> Not a kiddie movie in any way. Often very dark and frightening at times. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs. But keep a tissue handy. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are film sensitive. Without a doubt, one of the greatest animated films in the world. Along with Watership Down and my neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A heavenly masterpiece.
