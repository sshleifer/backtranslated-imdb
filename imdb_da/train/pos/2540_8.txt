Although they are not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as BLACK CAT and BODY SNATCHER), this is a dandy little horror movie, although the sales decisions were a bit odd. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a strange researcher living in the Carpathians - close to where the Dracula character's hometown. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. The leg - whose nationality was never discussed, although the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would have been sensible to have the two roles of change, as the carpathian role seems tailor-made to Lugosi - especially with his accent. Despite this unusual twist, they did two good jobs. Karloff was definitely the lead, but Lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person - something he didn't play very often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a paria, which other scientists (especially Benet) believe his theories are bizarre and unwise. But during the film, Rukh shows himself to be right, and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered is the unpleasant side effect of making him a crazy killer (don't you hate it when it happens?). Although it could only have been a simple, fine scientist, the sensible story became, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the evil Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie is bound to be enjoyed by everyone except for people who hate old horror movies. You can really tell that Universal Pictures has pulled all stops and made a bigger budget film instead of the cheap quickies that both Lugosi and Karloff obviously gravitated in recent years. Good things.
