Which masterpiece. Taking the cold war conflict and transporting it to the future. This movie is satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, it stands for Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The clever naming of the two superpowers, such as Confederation and the Market. Cons are commies and Market, The West! excellent. The wise use of the gen Joxs was before his time. only we really see the dangers of gene technology. Robot joxer tackled the subject head in 1989. <br /> <br /> The announcement in this movie is about the humility of the human being and how it can overcome the government's wishes. This movie scream does not make you get you, you will kill us all. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
