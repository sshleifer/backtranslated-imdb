This movie is just amazing. If you have a chance to see it, then run to see it. Although the movie has nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino has a good job as Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way about him where he can say something at least and make it sound just as well. If you thought Pulp Fiction was good with the swords (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle on how an actor can say them. (it's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast over time and doesn't keep the real-time format correct, it's still easy to follow, but you have to keep your eyes peeled at any time not to lose anything. Personally, I have found that watching this movie does three hours to look like a breeze. It's really just as good. This movie is one of the movies that are traded and managed so well that it not only makes you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s, but that actually makes you mess about the bad guy ... "Good night to the bad guy"
