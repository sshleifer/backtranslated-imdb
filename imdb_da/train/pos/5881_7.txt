This movie was a great comedy. It had a lot of comedians in it like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumar's wife, and it was also all the air winners. Mr Hot like Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr Cool like Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his job he becomes Akshay Kumar's senior and Akshay Kumar becomes really jealous because his opportunity must be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia begins to suffer John more. Akshay Kumar will be better than John Abraham, so he finds an opportunity and he goes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
