Winchester '73 was the movie that moved Mann from the b-movie to the big league where he rescued James Stewart's floundering post-war curve in the process by throwing him as a conflict hero (though he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves the credit for it) ). Both men would go to much darker places - Man with the remarkably gloomy Devil's Doorway left by the MGM until Broken Arrow's success convinced them to loosen it ?? But a movie about a man chasing his own brother as the title rifle is handed over from person to person along the track before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountain side shootouts is increasingly stronger meat than you would expect from the study system. Great dialogue, an impressive support box ?? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them ?? and Mann's excellent visual sense raises the bar with this.
