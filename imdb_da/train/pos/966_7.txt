2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official; The "Takashi Miike" movie, "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô" is the annual midnight screening of the new "Takashi Miike" movie. Call it what you want, this is a fanatic trip. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer, said this movie was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "Ringmaster" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After the screening I can understand where they went with it, but after all it is "Takashi Miike". He instructed '01 film'Ichi the Killer as it was screened at the festival's barf bags handed out at the screening. And no, it wasn't just a marketing grip. <br /> <br /> Plot overview: A young boy with a restless home life is "selected" and he stumbles into the middle of a big-world war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not really for kids, not for kids. Certainly see them being frightened scary with some of these spirits (even the kind ones) on the display. This is unlike anything I've seen in the cinema before. A fantasy natural, some very funny (but dark) materials. You will not be bored, can guarantee it. Will it ever hit North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
