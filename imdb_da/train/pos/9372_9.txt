Red Rock West is one of the rare movies that keeps you guessing all the time about what will happen next time. Nicolas Cage is mistaken in a contract killer when he enters a small town trying to find work. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better. Look for a short look of the country's song star Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are some easier moments. It is important that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
