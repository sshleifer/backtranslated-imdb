One of the finest movies ever made! Why it only has a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This movie is a window in the world of the black experience in America. Must be mandatory display for all white people and all children over 10 years. I recommend seeing it with "The Long Walk Home" as a companion. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Don't miss this movie, which should have won Oscar. (And also read the book!)
