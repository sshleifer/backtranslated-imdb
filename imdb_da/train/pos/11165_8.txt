Four words explain why this movie was made - "She made him wrong". The great commercial success of the Mae West vehicle convinced the study brass that the Gay 90's melodrama was a profitable proposal. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written drum that is aimed at the personalities of his stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take, but it is Fay Wray who steals the movie with his stock-in-trade lady in need. With a strong director - as Walsh turns out to be - Wray could carry a lot of battles, and she is completely credible as the object of both Raft and Bey's love. <br /> <br /> Lots of atmosphere, beautifully designed, This is a forgotten movie worthy of revival.
