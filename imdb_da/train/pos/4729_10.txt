A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start beating off the competition. But what makes Break a Play a real gem is the Sardinian look at the existence of the struggling (and not so) LA actor. It brings us into that world of effortless irony and joke. It also has a polished look and very good direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of the rare independent films that does not compromise its production values ​​at any level. The script is tight, the dialogue first rate. Cassini is an actress actor, and the role really shows its talents. The climatic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and can go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes all the time. I saw it in an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.
