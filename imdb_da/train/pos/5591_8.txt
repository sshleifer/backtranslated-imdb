The alternative title of ecstasy is the symphony of love, a title that appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie, and may well have been a classic movie if it was released in the silent film era. This film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrical quality, presented in an artfully low-key way. The director's style is clearly European. The subject and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than that produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the censorship code in the United States, during the thirties, which basically summarizes it. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love'.
