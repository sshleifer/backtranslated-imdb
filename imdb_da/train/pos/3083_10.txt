This deserves a 12 out of 10. A totally refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode, and it's true quality. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is centered around a few New Yorkers, playing around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and wisely blending their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are great, and that is also the wonderful Caseman. The scenery is stunning and the wardrobes are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more shows like this that make viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals who are not mindless drones. If it never comes back, six degrees will be very missed.
