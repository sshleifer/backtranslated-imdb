When I first saw this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and saw it about 3 times. We just saw it again and I liked it more than I did last time I had seen it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The movie is primarily about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (pronounced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half gangster and half good that I like. Itching is his sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie returns to life, it's the start of a great adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons why I'm totally CRAZY about this movie: One: I love the characters (except Carface). My favorite tree is Charlie, Itchy and a little girl called Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I love the period of history where this movie is set. It is set under the ban in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) is amazing. The backgrounds are also good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this movie that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are lovely. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, the wave, the excitement" ... Then watch this lovely movie when you can, you won't be disappointed! :);) :()
