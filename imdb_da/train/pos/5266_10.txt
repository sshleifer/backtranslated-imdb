Now some people will say that this movie stinks ... but hey! It's not right, not right. The movie may not have the best special effects, and may not have the best actors (except the barbarian bridge exelence). Whatever this little fact, I can honestly say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I've seen them all!
