Sandra Bernhard is without you I'm nothing, the movie was released in 1990, followed on the heels of her 1988 off-Broadway stage production ... what she and others refer to in the movie as her "smash-hit one-woman show." /> <br /> There were several changes in monologues and one-liners, and the movie version visually reveals the story and takes Sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful scene in New York while calling her superstar summer "an illusory, almost desperate existence back in his home in Los Angeles - her fictional director in the movie refers to it as getting Sandra back "to her roots to ... upscale sacrament clubs as the Parisian room. "<br /> <br /> There is one point to be made here. Sandra is trying to appeal to her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh criticism of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't quite see it. predominantly black audience and trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to like is "Shashonna", a Madonna look-like stripper. And even then, with Shashonna dancing to the drumming that resembles those of "Like a Virgin ", there's not much to say to the audience's enjoyment of the show. The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone. A fun scene catching is of a rounded man from the audience helping Shashonna out of the pants. > <br /> But if she goes down, Sandra does it with style and power, and conveys everything from a bad confidence to puncture vulnerability ... right to the point where she is naked (literally), claiming to accept and still swimming in the pool of his own transparent s Her portraits of interactions with Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we are looking for are) Warren Beatty is fictional and fun. <br /> <br /> Sandra starts her show in her most awkward moment, performing a quiet but mystifying reproduction of Nina Simone's song "Fire Women" while dressed in a mufti and other African rug, singing lines like " my skin is black "," my hair is the wool "and" they call me Sweet Thing. "<br /> <br /> Re-enacting and celebrating ghosts of underworld art in an incredibly fun description of the pious real estate sale to Andy Warhol:" Let it be Andy to get wisdom and sensitivity in hours and hours of unemployment and labor that went into the Indian product ... that they have been fortunate enough to deposit all this Santa Fe stuff that is happening. " > <br /> She unfolds on Hollywood's exaggeration, comforting a distraught friend and reassembling him, saying: "Lose if it's about ishtar, I stand up now and get out of your life forever because it's for self-giving even for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates women's expectations in the age of feminism. Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra restores her young girl's imagination to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. She eventually concludes in relief: "I will never be a statistic, not me. I am under 35 and I must be married!" Sandra derives the opening of sexuality in society: "When he touches you at night, it feels right or feels right? I say it feels right ... VERY real." Finally she cries for change in progressive American society by channeling disco greats Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and proclaiming, "Eventually all funk!" <br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of excellent, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and derived from Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro to name a few. At the same time, the idealized, fictional incarnation of Sandra - her self-built mirror image around the city, flows a beautiful black model with floating dresses and tight bustiers reading Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music. <You without you I am nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores feelings and existence, until then she had only been playing as a regular guest on late night with David Letterman. Her almost childlike enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the 80s is thrown aside in the face of a more subtle allure, and her confidence in materialism and American celebrity proves refreshing. This approach to comedy will change Sandra's direction forever and mark the more mature and more sensible entertainer to come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and superficial expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in the sting. It shouldn't be supposed to be fun across the board. Maybe it's a little disturbing or even maudlin for some. But consider the emptiness of the world Sandra paints for you and you will understand how fun and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But look without you, I'm nothing with a friend "in the known" because it's totally more fun that way. Before you know it, the two act by Sandra and confuse hell out of everyone else.
