I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell movie didn't make her beauty another sign in the movie. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to see and it plays very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been an MVP in so many British films, does a good job in this. There is some tragedy in this, but I think the movie has been saved at the end of the glorious play, pure direction and witty writing. The film quality is excellent and the music is also good even if it is not available on audio tracks.
