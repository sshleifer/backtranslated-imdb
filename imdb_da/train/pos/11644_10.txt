This show is amazing! I have been a fan since it was premiered and it only keeps me looking ... I've seen some horrible things here that I wish I didn't have, but it really shows you how addiction affects everyone involved, not just those addict. You can see all kinds of addiction, from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder. And actually it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through too. We've seen finished musicians, an NBA player, and even young people who really need the help. And since they have started to show some follow-up, it has also been fantastic. Now you can see how they are long after their ep is sent. If you haven't checked this out, do it. It's on A&E and it's amazing! The new eps is Sunday evening at. 10:00 AM EST, if I remember correctly ... then set your TiVo!
