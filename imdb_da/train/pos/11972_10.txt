I grew up seeing the whole house as a child. I stopped seeing it for years, but about two weeks ago I began to see it again. Now my kids are watching the show and they love to see it too. My kids can't believe the DJ, on the show, and I'm the same age. I really love the show because it's a show you can see with your family. It has good teachings that your children can learn from. There are also no drugs and violence on it. Also, when the kids on the show have a problem, they can always open their family for help. It is the message that the children must come from TV one day, turn to your family for help, not for drugs. Children should see more shows as Full House instead of half the mess on TV today. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it's down to earth. It speaks of real problems and family relationships. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I agree with the show 10.
