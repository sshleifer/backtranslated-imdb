I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I saw it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. My view of the movie may be partially biased since I had never read the game before, but I was drawn into this film's understanding. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever lived, and the story of Hamlet is certainly one of his best results. <br /> <br /> But now on to the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found out that all the actors in the film had a firm understanding of what they said and thus could articulate it quite well . Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet are nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. What I liked about this was that it worked very well as a "MOVIE" and not as a game you are studying. You do not have to be wealthy with Shakespeare to relate to the whole pupil's village going through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> It's my two cents.
