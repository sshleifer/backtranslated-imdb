Well done ghost story that gives you creeps and some fair scares along the way. The story unfolds slowly and builds the atmosphere until you are ready to see the woman in black. You won't forget her when you've seen her. No gore, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-constructed story that is best seen at night with the lights out.
