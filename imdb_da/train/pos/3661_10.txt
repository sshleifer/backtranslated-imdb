Snobs and pseudo-experts consider it "far away from De Sica's best" Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italian does not have the rugged self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers or the bitter self-parody of Pietro Germi, Mario Monicelli's sharp bittersweetness, Visconi's solemnity, or Antonioni's cold observation. De Sica told us the stories that a father is sitting at the edge of his children's bed before going to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and, to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universal are realistic adventures, or what are we called magic realism today. The movie is a gem from the beginning to the end, and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but of course it requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.
