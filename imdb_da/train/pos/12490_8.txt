Allen and Julie move into a hut in the mountains after their daughter has been murdered one night. No one knows who killed the little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and it is haunted by people who killed themselves there and nobody in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some of the parts are predictable, but once in a while there is something I didn't expect. It was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to do it pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also liked the end because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. It is also a kind of sad movie, but also a well done horror movie.
