Out of all the princess stories Disney has put out there, Cinderella probably has the most persistent appeal. I can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation generates her at the top of their lists. As a little girl, I no longer wanted to be Cinderella with her zipper - it was my absolute favorite costume. Honestly, I don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than cinderella. Who has never wanted to run away from the daily life of the drudgeries and find someone who sees you as no one else has ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it is still true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, if not otherwise, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is sorry for T, in a wonderful calculation, not obviously physical way. Her cutter and eyes do the work for her - she doesn't need lightning to hit fear in your heart. The animal's friends tend to grill, especially the idiotic Gus. I would have cheered if he had met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella himself was no pushover-making some fair catty remarks at times. But she just lacked the drive to make her quite sympathetic. Well, she was lovely and fed animals, but what kept her in that place? We never know. Although she only became a girl in another house, she at least gets paid and takes a shot in respect. It seems like the only reason things go out at the end for Cindy is that everything kind of falls into its lap. She never works for her dreams, which she sings so sadly. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the music which is lovely as ever. Ilene Woods has a nice, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great standards come here- A dream is a wish, your heart does it so it's love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... Cinderella is a wonderful heart story with lots of musical highlights. Although it lacks in some character development, it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you have heart pain, pop it - it will warm you up and make you soft. Mmm Mmm God! <br /> <br /> Movie Quote: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -You duh-congratulations day!
