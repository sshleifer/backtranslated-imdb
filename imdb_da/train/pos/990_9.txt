I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is pretty much out there ... the federal government is getting a tracking device implanted in a small thief's jaw to lure a more dangerous thief / computer hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man who has been "volunteered" to be implanted with the device, is a very sympathetic person, and it turns out to be fun to head with him for a while. Alvin even shows himself to be much more than a good-humored, but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not as easily manipulated as he might think. Definitely worth a watch.
