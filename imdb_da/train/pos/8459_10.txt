I'm not a big fan of most anime, but the Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam wing lacks all the stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, as the number of jokes made during the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, Gundam Wing goes right down to business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. Large parts focus on diplomatic relations in a war, not just the fighting. Although combat animations lack extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundammer are almost works of art given the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> In my knowledge, this 49 episode plus a movie series was downloaded by cartoon networks in 2000 and then professionally baptized by them as well. The heading is simply flawless. Not only does every word say match up, but the votes really do make the characters much more credible. many think it is best to watch anime with subs in English, but I simply do not have the determination to do so. <br /> <br /> Not only the voices are good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. I just want to say that it left me to scour the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The reason of this series is what really wants viewers, and no, do not tick yourself as a prime time drama like Lost, which was made only for the purpose of hanging you. Explaining the reason deeply would lead to many spoilers, as many of the personalities do not even have names until very few episodes in the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its now self-contained colonies have difficulty maintaining peace. Thus, a war is initiated leading to military coups and deepening diplomatic situations. I feel that more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks ALL anime is stupid (they have a good reason to think about it), and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.
