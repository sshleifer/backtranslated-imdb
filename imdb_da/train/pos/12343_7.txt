Artistically, this is a beautiful movie - movies, music and costumes are beautiful. In fact, this movie is more beautiful than the directors of Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he wrote the film only as it was made several years after his death. As far as writing goes, the dialogue was well written, and the story was sometimes interesting. The story, however, was also quite depressing and not yet involved in any way. After all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, while prostitution has been considered a much more acceptable business in Japan, women are still seeking a better life. This reminds me a lot about the movie Streets Of Shame, although Streets Of Shame's characters are much less sympathetic and more one-dimensional. So overall it becomes a 7 - mostly because of everything, but the BUT writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story of the great Kurasawa.
