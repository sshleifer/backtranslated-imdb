Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Academy Award winning 'Gandhi', back in '83. I didn't know of any other work in his checkout, because I recently came to "Cry Freedom", which was released back in 1987. Although it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, it is just as poignant, if not more. , and was released when South Africa still hadn't got rid of apartheid hangers. While most movies on social issues come out after the event happened, I think one was released over time. The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who used to work in South Africa until the late 70s. It traces the origins of Wood's friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can't imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and display presence that Biko's character required. <br /> <br /> While Woods was originally opposed to what he felt, black racism was scattered by Biko, after meeting the man, he couldn't help pulling into his struggles and ideas. The connection between them grows stronger, and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the situation of the people Biko represents. <br /> <br /> Finally, tragedies hit, and Woods now has to concentrate on fleeing South Africa with his book so he can have it published and let the outside world know what's going on. The other half of the film is a poignant tale of his escape from South Africa with his family and keeps you on tenthooks. There are also some fun humorous dialogues. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Are you telling violence? Biko: I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, isn't it violence, Mr Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I have a confrontation now, but I can't see any violence. <br /> <br /> There are, however, moments that bring you back to the horrors that permeated the country before better sense domination. The scene where the army opens fire on a protest of school children is intestinal and heartbreaking. This is definitely a must see. I would suggest to those who are not familiar with Attenborough's work so take the time. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. I'd rather prefer the latter.
