So many educational films are nothing but mind-numbing drudgery, only saved by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why study Industrial Arts?" Will think). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It is about blood, heart and circulation. I admit that I can't remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything and keeping it serious but entertaining. I guess you can always count on June Foray (most famous Rocky the Squirrel's voice, she plays a deer here). Since "Hemo the Magnificent" itself can be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class sees it while a gremlin is forming.
