I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who usually rejects rejects and ensembles with the commentary "Uhm ... looks good, but I am not in the mood for that movie. Almighty Solo Movie Night "! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found the welcome to Collinwood a pretty enjoyable movie. While in the end pretty forgettable, it has some moments of fun and a few laughing loudly high moments. I was not aware of the fact that it was a remake and usually watch movies that try to ignore that fact and see them at their own profit anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and short como as a sure safe cracker who mostly left me wondering two things ... 1. Not all comedies would be better if Mr. Clooney put a weird 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easy do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, did a good job, and you get the impression that they were good at working together, which is quite important in a movie like this. Needless to say, everything isn't going as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humorous, but it made me check out the special features and consider seeing the original so I consider it a success! Rent this a good time, maybe take a few friends and a pizza. You want to feel good. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the very entertained Paolo Conte who has used it and left me humming the snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.
