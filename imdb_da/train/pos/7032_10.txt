My school's drama club will put this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope that we are as good as this! I recently considered this movie as a kind of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez) and I just want to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The cast for this movie was right (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything he can't do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson ever - I especially loved all his funny facial expressions and dancing under "Put on a Happy Face!" He is so good! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to seductive was completely credible. Tyne Daly was funny when Albert's unpleasant mother and George Wendt were excellent as the annoyed Mr. McAfee (but I LOVED Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau struck me as Ursula Merkle; she really hammered it up! And Marc Kudisch was a fantastic Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting that I didn't understand, and as you will see from previous comments, many other people didn't understand Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean, she's really beautiful and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm misleading. <br /> <br /> Okay anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It will let you smile! <br /> <br />
