I just watched this movie and fell in love with it. There is something for everyone, and it is especially free for everyone when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is the unspeakable realization that time is the most precious item and it is most obvious when they are together. This idea taken from several angles, from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional places. The movie almost makes you so desperate when you know that tomorrow might well be your last. Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I have always had a soft point for the accent, but I almost melted with his depiction of his character. The way this movie was shot is also beautiful, with the music, the background of the open fields and excellent plays. All in all, this is a wonderful movie that draws on all human emotions.
