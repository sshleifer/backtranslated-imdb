Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep your head over water after running out of ideas. Can't say much about this movie without telling the story. I can say that the little one was as it looks as if you look at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by everyone.
