* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The authors of this story knew these men very well. The actors also looked very good at them. The result is that at the end of the movie, you feel like you're actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are there, especially in the awkward first moments. But as the two begin to loosen, the old camera training that made the Beatles work so well begins. The bitterness is still there and interrupts at times, but when John gets the idea of ​​taking up Lorne Michaels on his offer to pay the Beatles gag sum of $ 3000 to appear on "Saturday Night Live", the two could be the same boyish pranksters who terrorized Liverpool as teenagers and survived playing the tough nightclubs in Hamburg to travel to Superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful imagination justifies us gently. We are reminded why a Beatles reunion was probably never possible even before Lennon's murder. The two driving forces in the group exclaimed each other.
