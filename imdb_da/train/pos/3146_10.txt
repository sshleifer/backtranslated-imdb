If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 great seasons and a great pleasure for television after dinner. With the constant change of relationships and finding out who Hyde is real father is, this was a hit when it started in August 98, even though it was set in 1976. And hanging out in Foremans basement was always the thing to do again then and it is still today with circles. This show gave great grin to premieres and it still does during re-runs. If you see a few episodes of this show, you get everything and want more. Now, only this show is one of the best ever created, it is wise and fun.
