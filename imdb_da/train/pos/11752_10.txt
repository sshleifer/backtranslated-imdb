Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was a quarterback in the famous game and is the local legend, now a van repair specialist whose life falls into drowsiness, just like the city of Taft itself. <br /> <br /> Williams gets an idea to recreate the story by playing the game again! He meets with skeptical resistance, so he goes on a one man terror talk and literally paints the city, orange, yellow and black, to increase the residents' ire to recreate the game. After that, the players from the 1972 team succeeded in reuniting and trying to get in shape to practice, which is hysterical. The game is on, Bakesfield is packed with all the high-tech gadgets, game strategies and sophisticated training routines.

And who is Kid Lester ??? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed provide memorable performances like wives from Williams and Russell. Succeed at many levels. And 10!
