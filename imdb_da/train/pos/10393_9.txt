Let's cut a long story short. I loved every minute of it. A sumptuous fantasy in true Arabian nights style. There is an evil magician, a beautiful princess, a jinn and everyone lives happily ever. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Only quibble: special effects are pretty dated (loved Sabu with the jean's foot, though!)
