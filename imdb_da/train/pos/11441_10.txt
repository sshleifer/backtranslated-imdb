As a person seeking an existence as a "professional" person with income supported by a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my beauty was always speculatively persistent outside relaxed in things that were more artistic. My educated classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art drawing, which also included silk screening. <br /> <br /> I also keep healthy with jogging, walking, and eventually walking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, hiking and hiking come close to the ground with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds. In this context, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skill and smoothness of director / cinema Thomas Riedelsheimer. In fact, I couldn't separate Goldsworthy's art with Riedelsheimer's camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
