... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I was BLOWN AWAY of this short movie. I saw it by chance when I was in Boston at a film festival and I thanked God for it every day since. I really think I was part of an event like reading a Tarantino script before others did or see the first screening of Mean Streets. I'm not sure which festival the short leader to next or what the creative team is having for future products, but I hope I can be there for that. Again, an amazing piece of film making.
