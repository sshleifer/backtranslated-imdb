The last command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. It shows us the sarist general, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory. In 1917 he had all power, but after the revolution and the collapse He also has love for a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). About ten years later, he uses a small role in a film about the revolution. His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who has to choose whether or not to hire him as a movie. The last command is very good silent drama.Emil Janning's memorable role in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful to play the woman's lead.William Powell is amazing as always. There are lots of scenes to remember in this movie. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. And then it ends with Powell and Janning's. This is a movie that touches in many parts.
