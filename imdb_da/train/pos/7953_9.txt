This is a story of two dogs and a cat looking home. Old and clever Golden Retriever Shadow, young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy fly from the ranch and go into the desert to be reunited with their family. Home Course Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham. It is a remake of a 1963 movie. This film got a successor three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to make voice-over for Chance. Fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role. Sally Field works well as Sassy.Don Ameche is amazing as Shadow. This was this veteran actor's second largest movie. Also the visible actors are great. Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford-Seaver. Robert Hays is Bob Seaver. Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford. Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver. Jane Smart portrays Kate. It is amazing to see these pets trying to survive in the desert. We see Sassy taken off the river and she seems like ag oner.Bearscene is exciting and fun .Chance has no chance with the big, hungry bear. And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful. This is something fun for the whole family.
