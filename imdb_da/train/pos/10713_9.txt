An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is taken by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic peoples who have gone down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as Highland Clearances, are in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it is a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. I am English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of the Gaelic speech is still wonderful. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you see the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked countless minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multicultural or social justice should go and see this film.
