In the winter of 1931, the 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (like Michael Sullivan Jr.) thinks what his gunfire Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) is living for. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one evening and testify that he is blowing away some rival gangsters. This leads - in a very round road - to "Godfather" -type Paul Newman (like John Rooney) hiring independent hitman Jude Law (like Harlen Maguire) to track Hoechlin and Hanks who are out to cool their heels in Chicago. Hanks believes they will be safe with a relative who is scary when considering the character's style of work. <br /> <br /> Looks scary as Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), where Hoechlin does a great job for director Sam Mendes; and getting started with this roll makes him the luckiest young actor from 2002. But the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the amazing filmography of Conrad L. Hall, who deserved a "Academy Award" career for it late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really superlative. This helps to compensate for the overall impression of a measured, confronted stubbornness for both the narrative and the visuals. The deviant end is suddenly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
