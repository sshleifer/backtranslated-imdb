** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the single player was very good. First level is probably one of the best in the game when you are in London, and some evil guys destroy it by kidnaping the prime minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save her and it is quite a large level, but must take you at least five minutes. The best part and I also think the funniest part is when you are in the jet package and people are rapping down Big Ben. Just stick the jet-pack's most trustworthy rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down. Clean fun! The rest of the levels are very good, but rather short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock and it's one of the downsides, because only the first two are really fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' goals, I mean, c 'mon! We have lots of points to unlock these missions, and the last two bonuses are really bad! The multi-player, I and some of my friends agree, are very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. Halo had no robots, but it's still some fine multiplayer games! You can be a lot of bad guys and you go against each other and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without considering their character. Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there are the odd bad graphics, but it's not extremely frequent). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comment needed, just great, you get to run in jet packages and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay Value - 7/10 (the only levels I go back on are the Loondon Level and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> Could have a little improvement, but it's still good.
