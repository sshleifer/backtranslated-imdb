I really like this movie ... when I started to see it, I thought I would be bored very soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and have seen it a couple of times now. The characters are credible and I have to say I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time was Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of his but I agree with another comment made earlier that the end is a little disappointing. I would have loved to show it a little differently! However, forget about the well-poignant story.
