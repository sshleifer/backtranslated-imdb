Siblings will be released in theater on March 24 in Sweden. A great opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg along with a retrospective dedicated to the festival festival "Focus in Focus" Kim Longinotto. She gave a master class, much appreciated, tells of her method as a documentary and told the audience about the special circumstances that led her to shoot sister in law twice: the first version was lost too well, so another shooting was organized and the movie turned out to be different at the end. A rather terrible problem has occurred in this case to create the possibility of a very strong film.
