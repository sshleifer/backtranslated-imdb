This western is done in a different way to most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. This is presented as a most interesting piece of Americana. I would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape, but it is worth seeing how life was in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excels in this film.
