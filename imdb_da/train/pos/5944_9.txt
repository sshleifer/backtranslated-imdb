I would say this at first: ... Why, oh why, can WB not do what those short film directors do? Sandy is, of course, a fantastic director and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I suppose they are being driven a little when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 can make a superhero fan suffocate. The world's finest is one of the best short films I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> Choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a genius choice. Let's see the people, Superman is no supermodel. He can be nice, but he is not a GQ Stud. And I don't know what the guy a few comments about me was on, but Superman is actually pretty bitter (Have you ever read a Superman cartoon?). I guess the fact alone, just floor me ... It seems such an obvious choice to get someone with some muscle mass to play a superhero, rather than a beautiful face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent Batman ... I don't know guys ... If given a bigger budget and his own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be throat and throat . Bottom line, This is one of only a few Super Hero movies with actors actually watching. <br /> <br /> Acting is also pretty nice. I don't know what everyone is talking about, O'Hearn isn't that bad. He's amazingly convincing as Superman, and Bartram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, come people, this movie had a $ 12,000 budget, what did you expect? Everyone else is good too, unless Two-Face seems a little tougher than usual ... But hi, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones for reference. Oh, Lois is also pretty hot. <br /> <br /> The SFX is flippin 'sweet too. I mean watching Superman lift the car ... MAN !, how cool it is. Unlike the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I might have to put this above it, when Mike actually looks like he's flying and with ease. The flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again with a bigger budget ... Oh, and he even used a Batmobile! (It was probably a model, but it looked damn convincing). <br /> <br /> All in all, this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a trustworthy director and needs to be separated by some kind of a project ... But no, they (like most of the Marvel projects) will just continue to get those hackers who hardly see the fans and what they care about, and continue to clear these gamble movies. Thank goodness Superman Returns was a hit or it would have been the end of it seriously. The world's finest is excellent and in my book it counts as a superhero movie.
