A hot-headed policeman accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers the crime, but has to deal with a guilty conscience while attempting to resolve a murder. Andrews and Tierney reunite with Director Preminger in a film noir that is as effective as "Laura", their previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly cast as the serious policeman, a good guy caught in unfortunate circumstances. The plot is nice, including Malden as a hard police officer and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The manuscript of Hecht, a large and productive screenwriter, is exciting and exciting, and Preminger creates a good mood.
