I don't know why people think it's such a bad movie. It has a good plot, some good actions, and the change of location to Harry doesn't hurt either. Sure some of its offensive and free, but it's not the only movie as such. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as the little townman. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, it is much better than the DEATH POOL. 4.5
