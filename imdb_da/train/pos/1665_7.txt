The film looked like a review for the "Immoral Study". Most likely, I was never very much involved in the female artist's burning need to immortalize male nude and thus all the bustle of "Now, who pulled this penis?" sounded a little free. Dialogues in this movie are pretty awful, though visually this movie has got its moments. I almost dig it when Tassi came in to paint a mental picture, but when the film ran back on the penises. Highly recommended for those who have not seen one between.
