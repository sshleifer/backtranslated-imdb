I enjoyed the Night Listener a lot. It's one of the better movies in the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the whole casting was very good. Everyone played only the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful cartoon. Toni Collette is great as a mother and never goes over the top. Everyone is very trustworthy. <br /> <br /> It's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and made it straight, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than telling a story and telling it well . <br /> <br /> Don't get sucker stopped by the previews and ads. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See Night Listener because you will see a good story told well. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie was the end. The director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but it is a less ambiguous one.
