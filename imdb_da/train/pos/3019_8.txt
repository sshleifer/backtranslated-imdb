Initially, I loved casting channel 1, it had many classic jokes, including the unfortunate guy in the canoe, who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is still acting the same guy in the cast channel 2 movie But, in my opinion, performance is not as fun as in the first movie, in fact you do not notice him much at all. One thing that made me think badly about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only race boats, they are probably fast, but they do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie, I liked the old ones better, and these new boats make one of the last scenes ridiculous when in the canoe you suddenly jump out of it to avoid the "big waves" from the small fast boats. Really a minus. You have to accept that we do not live in the same Sweden as in 1974 anymore. This movie also contains a little more violence than the first. Although the movie was good all in all. I just concentrated on some disadvantages that I was disappointed with, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so go see it! It's worth the money.
