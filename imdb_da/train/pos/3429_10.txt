I watched this movie premiere Friday (1/19) night in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and hearing the first-hand attack soldiers going through was almost more than I could carry. Others in the audience were just as moved, and while we wanted to turn away, the least we could witness was that these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film, were present. While perhaps at home now, you can see that the war is still in them and probably will always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with nothing but a bumper. Watch this movie!
