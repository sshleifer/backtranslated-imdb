This movie does a great job of portraying the situation of an ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) sufferer. The topic is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe she was only active. Kenneth Branagh, an amazing actor, lives up to the expectations of the peculiar artist who fails and is forced to give companionship to Helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Seeing the evolution of the relationship between these two is a treat from start to finish. The fact that it is an adventure does not detract from the amazing performance. You are going to worry deeply for the two.
