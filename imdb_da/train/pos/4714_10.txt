Famous words of foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni, the "miserable corkscrew" who spends the entire movie, not only as Johnny Dangerously's rival, but also butcher the English language. <br /> <br /> Another underrated classic that you can only find in the afternoon matineees or Late Late Late Show is Johnny Dangerously a terrific satirical hit on a kindhearted boy who secretly leads a crime scene to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother through the law school. br /> Yes, there is a story but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr. keeps you waiting to see what's happening next time. There are too many laughs in this to put on here. Just like the airplane you need to be aware or you will miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
