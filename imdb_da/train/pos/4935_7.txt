In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the little criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body dumped in the ocean. During the autopsy, the family man finds Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service said the dead had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he had to find out who had any kind of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The Mayor assigns the skeptical captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find those killed who are infected with the plague and inoculate them. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and with a big villain. The engaging plot has not been dated after thirty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable foam in his debut and the camera works while trying to escape with Zero Mostel, is still very impressive. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Panic in the Streets"
