To be honest I had to watch this movie backwards, not expecting much, but hey, I was not deceived, I was well. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is way of fresh breeze despite some facts that they tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it made me aware of these youth films from the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to make children interact with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, when her father was in Hollywood, why not rent a home with a mystery behind the doors? Well, that makes Emma Roberts at least a good job here. Like the shabby child, who was initially brought to support her sister's prank to Nancy, but ultimately Nancy found it pretty cool enough to hold on to herself with her stuff ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast is great and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in another role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway don is not fun!
