I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the other one when I saw it in a store. This one was (I think) just as fun as the first but a much harder story. It was fun how they had their own staff's hell and how to play death. The funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games as clues. The only thing I wanted to change is Station and Death in the band, but except that it was great.
