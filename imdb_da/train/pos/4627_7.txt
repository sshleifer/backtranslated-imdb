If you are going to play a game within the prison walls, why not go to the best playwright William Shakespeare? And if you choose your throw from many criminals who earn long sentences for the most hideous crimes, you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky Correctional Prison, a brave project like this was done with great results. This movie shows how everything was done. .Afstøbningen. .Prøverne. The set and costumes and the final presentation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". It didn't happen before me, but there is an analogy between the player's attitude and the corrective prison. In the play, the shipwrecked characters are confined to an island without contact with the outside world. Prison life is also much like that. <br /> <br /> With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape, the characters in a most comfortable range of costumes can bend their lines to an approval audience, perhaps not quite as Shakespeare but with good heart and true sincerity. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of every man behind his character. An inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. It was right to move to see the men dry away a tear when they talked about murder, shooting and choking. One had the feeling that they all want to return the clock and rethink their brutal actions. But (as someone said) the past was over, and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the lesson gave temporary relief from the depressed thoughts of past events. The prison authorities must be applauded to allow the game to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone benefits not only the Kentucky prison, but also the prisoners who need to find new trust and self-esteem and be prepared for the day they go out on the slogan.
