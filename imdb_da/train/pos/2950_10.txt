If you were ever sorry that you couldn't get a movie on DVD, it was probably Delirious you were looking for. How often do you laugh when you look up with comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" and "Raw" (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie got much of his inspiration. Now that I am older and have seen both Pryor and many comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everyone comes from Eddie, while Eddie LOVELY BORROWED from Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was original, fun, provocative, thoughtful ?? and more. He was something that had never been seen before. He was everything we ever needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but once he was the king, and "killing" was the greatest castle ever built. Really one of the most fun routines of all time.
