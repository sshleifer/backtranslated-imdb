Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> Yokai of the first installment includes teapot freak, coat of water imp, a living 'brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with another face on the back, a dwarf priest with a huge calabash-like wrists, etc. These kind of capricious monsters come not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment in the Tokugawa Era, which is comparable to today's halloween haunted houses or "freak shows" of yesteryear but with only fake freaks. Ghosts & goldfish monsters and dancing single-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "chills" in the hot summers. The fatcheek woman and the like were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple and hoky, this makes them more representative of what was historically recreated for summer temperatures. <br /> <br /> These righteous monsters have to look away and destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan and disguised himself as a samurai lord. In spite of that, some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit of a bitch, and for many of the costumes is no more than masks without even moving lips as they speak, it plays a lot of poker and is very charming. It has some beautiful movies, much like it would be in a CGI movie of the same decade. Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX director of the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not the same as Majin at its best, but Yokai is still fun. The first miike movie, which is the most child-oriented of his family movie, with GOZU & IZOO continuously more serious, but not too serious for young viewers.
