Better than the typical TV movie INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Brown Murray Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high concept update for the well-known Faustian plot. Urich is just as always, and Lucci is especially fetching and devilish over the top of the mother of all femme fatal roles. A kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film commits early to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision, and horror fans are unlikely to have many complaints to the mushroomed maudlin document. 10.7
