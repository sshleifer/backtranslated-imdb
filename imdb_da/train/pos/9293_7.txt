Hint number one - read the title as "The Mad Hounds Time" or maybe dogs. This is a beautifully good ensemble piece (see throwing and renting it - you know you're curious already), and first-time director bishop gives them their chance, takes their time, lets the characters interact and chew nature as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of "the great boss" and whatever revenge follows. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight of Christopher Jones is his self-imposed exile from film; He remains an upcoming movie presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the "Wild in the Streets" Reunion Party!
