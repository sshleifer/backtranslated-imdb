I loved so much about this movie ... the time to develop the characters, the details, the amazing performances, the amazing lighting and filmography, the wonderful soundtrack ... It has a combined intensity and ease of touch that does not work for everyone who wants the typical quick action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I would say that this movie is a bit like a Shakespeare tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The foundation is simple, but history is complex. The movie is intelligent in relation to conditions and problems. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a cartoon (or graphic novel). At times I felt that I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - that was such a realistic, yet dreamlike quality in its narrative style. I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based on, but in this case I do. (Although I could also enjoy the book.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insights into the comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin, who is a little younger than the boy in the movie to see it after I saw it for the first time because he has trouble at home and I wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion about father's problems with him, he loved it - and the discussion.)
