one of the best ensemble acting movies I've ever seen. There is not much to the plot, but it works - unbelievable. You see the signs ever changing so subtly, wondering the influence of the rented villa in Italy and love. And good luck. The movie casts a fascinating magic on you, much as the villa does on all the women. Really "enchanted".
