Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie Valentine. It was so well-made, well-written, well-behaved, well-informed, etc.! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), totally horrifying and scary (Paige's death), and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the whole cast did a good job, especially the three leaders: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both I met and got autographs from under the movie of this movie - VERY nice people!), And Marley Shelton. <br /> <br /> I'm very sick of people calling this movie "Another Scream Clone". This movie is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this movie runs around Scream. It actually does SENSE! Scream was also not the only movie to have a masked murderer in it. Sorry, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (ahem ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also exclaimed masked killers). I also think the news of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It is so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all these horrible things. Another novelty (nose bleeding) makes room for a great ending! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So even if you didn't like it the first time, watch Valentine again and give it a try! <br /> <br /> PS - Watch my new site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon ...
