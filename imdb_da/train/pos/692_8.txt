I first saw this movie at a festival. There were many good movies, but few made me think that long ago, and an Insomniacs Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted movie maker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in her role as she perfectly designed. There wasn't much to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. And Ellen-- I can't wait to see where she ends up! She shows a lot of talent, and I hope she does a few more movies. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap excitement, Tess shows that it doesn't need as long as there's a good story and actors. Kudos to everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and co. to distribute it on DVD!
