this is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie when it came out. I recently watched this movie again and it still keeps up with my memory of it. Many movies we watched when we were younger did not seem to stop when we see them later in life. The film is actually a great 80's example of the type of movie that is made then. Keaton is at its best, all the actors have actually done a good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie together instead of forcing it. The pace of the movie is fast with few slow spots and watching the cars from the 80s is too fun. From the 80's I loved to see the ugly pacer again. The movie is a great movie for all comedy lovers and 80s movie lovers.
