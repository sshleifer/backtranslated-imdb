I appreciate every frame of this beautiful movie. It's about permanent people, people we all know who suffer a little in their lives and have some luggage to carry around. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe in their depictions and are all excellent, but Harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real. You would swear he really is a truck that drinks so he doesn't have to feel anything. Baker as his sweet sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers on a scene, it seems she never got flowers before and probably wasn't. Well worth it.
