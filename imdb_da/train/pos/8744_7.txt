This is a low budget film with a cast of unknown and a minimum of place shot. The Philippines replaces Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. The support shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfect. This movie shows that you don't need mega budgets or a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains neither the gobble nor the profits that young film studios often stumble upon. Solid craftsmanship from people who know all aspects of film making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. An excellent job!
