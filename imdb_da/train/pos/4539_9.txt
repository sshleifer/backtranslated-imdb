The plot is rather cheesy, but for the people of this area up in the 80s and is now the Detroit area of ​​automotive engineers, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, so it makes this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Last night Jay Leno showed up at The Tonight Show! He looks pretty young here 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the drawstring of what seems to be Woodward Ave, was great. <br /> <br /> Now, Leno owns some bad a ** cars now, it would be great to see this remake with his modern collection. I'm sure the windy Vette in the opening scene was his own car. Typical 80's movie. See it and enjoy. No computer generated crap!
