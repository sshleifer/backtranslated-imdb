Sure, the story in this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but it is far from being the only story of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sits with the Americans because he sees himself as a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had only recently taken over New Orleans; he broke his deal and returned to smuggling, which led to sailing to Galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and disgrace than a whole * or * a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is a movie that is pure entertainment - and faces what we all wanted Jean to go to the feisty wench rather than the governor's prudish daughter. Brynner again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.
