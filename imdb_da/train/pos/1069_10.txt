I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 and 2 two weeks ago after catching a few season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I haven't had anything so much since Firefly (also and great show). I admit season 2, it's not that good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Design this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) And Alec is amazing. I heard some of the plans for it would be season 3 and I have to say I can't believe it was canceled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! I also think that it has a lot of potential as a movie (although it currently seems very unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I'm three episodes away from having seen both seasons twice. It's just too good.
