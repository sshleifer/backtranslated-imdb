When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing, and the settings are also beautifully shot. The only thing that really releases me is the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the movie that brings Victoria to life, and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and may choose a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert, but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have support roles but are forgettable. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie feels like unfinished. Perhaps the screenwriters have changed too many things in the script, I don't know, but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a fantastic movie about Victoria's early years with a fantastic performance from emily blunt
