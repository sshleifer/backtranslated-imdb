Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as the quiet hit man Alex. <br /> <br /> All the shows here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married hitman (like his father) with a little son, goes through a medieval crisis and wants to finish the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will The spirit of Sarah, whom he falls in love with. One day Alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job killing a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch it if you like mature, interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
