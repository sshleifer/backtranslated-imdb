The third and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of them all. The training is even completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this movie details Hanzo's study of loan sharking is done by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical comment on the old Japanese prideful refusal to involve Western technology. Where the first Hanzo movie was just a fun and fun little connection to its plot, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" manages to connect everything and bring it all home eventually. Absolutely the perfect finale. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is plenty of unnecessary blood and violence (that is * Hanzo Razor).
