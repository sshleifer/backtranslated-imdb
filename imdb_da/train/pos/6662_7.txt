Gandhi My Father is a great movie. It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji's oldest son, Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies Harilal's role. Just not him, everyone enjoyed the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best on the screen Gandhiji I've ever seen. But I will cut three points as there were few errors. <br /> <br /> First, the movie was fifteen and twenty minutes longer than it should have. Secondly, the film needed more research into Harilal's character. Somewhere the character was incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. No other Gandhiji child was mentioned throughout the film. I think the character like Harilal should have at least some differences, his brothers too, given Harilal's selfish nature. <br /> <br /> Despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie.
