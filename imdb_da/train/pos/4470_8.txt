In the same way as "On the Town" this musical sailors on shore are subject to the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry cartoon mouse "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover destined to reach his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend, and Grayson, the woman who serves as a love interest for both men, do most of the song. Iturbi gives some fine piano play. In almost two and a half hours it is a little too long for a light musical, but it does not pull.
