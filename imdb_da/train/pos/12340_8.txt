There is a lot to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mysterious game - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line of truth sincerely claims. This also suffers to a great extent from the fact that this is credited as the first film using back projection. The sets are fake. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two good forces in this show: even though the dialogue is read, the visual notions are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is a little remembered today: mostly for Rose Hobart, where Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shot off her: credit Melfords stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (though stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the terrestrial sections of this movie. <br /> <br /> But one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the heavenly sections that make this great, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the journey to ' the hot spot '. H. B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So we have a flawless but very interesting version here. I think Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the heavenly scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the dimmed musical remake. But I still enjoy much of this version and think you should give it a try.
