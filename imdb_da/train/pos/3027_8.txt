I see many movies, good, bad and indifferent; There is usually something of interest to fix on, although it is only a design or a reliable manpower of a good character actor or the lost laughter that comes from seeing the opacity caught forever. <br /> <br /> But, I was quite pleasantly surprised by this movie, one I had never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into movies many times of course in such masterpieces as "Thin Man" and in smaller vehicles. "Confidential Agent" is one of the smaller vehicles, but it still manages to make me a place, despite the lack of direction, the inconsistency between Bacall and Boyer's depictions as British and Spanish respectively, and the almost complete lack of existence of anyone chemistry between the two leads. In some ways, this final "problem" actually begins to work in favor of the movie, for how can love really flourish in the murderous atmosphere of fascism and capitalism of a person's tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene's complex and guilty psychology that permeates the film. I know some see the conscious pacing here as boring and I can understand it. Yet I found that plodding rather than degraded by what is a claustrophobic world. I was forced to watch, not by any big play (although Boyer is wonderful as usual, manages to convey a rich mix of world fatigue, tragedy, hope and joy with his magnificent voice and longing eye) budding rush of a man's slender hope for a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love for death? Where does the final profit and exploit begin? The movie does not rise to the art level and therefore cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than just entertainment, and its murder and guilt are very scary. The lack of glitz, of "bubble" of narrative "bounce" helps make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> And there's no happy end, because history wrote the end.
