I remember watching this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin, and the breathing-dead body in it was the scary part of the movie for me, only intensified by the darkness of the film. I also wondered the people hanging from the trees at the end until I recognized that part of the movie where the Blackwood family's name was changed from Blackblood because in the family history there was a sign known for its many hangings by different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kicks off adding to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster first enters the cemetery, he is cautious about noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
