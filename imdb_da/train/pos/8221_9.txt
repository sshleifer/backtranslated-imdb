Suddenly, Impact is the fourth of the Dirty Harry movies, and one of the best features of these movies is that they are not really degraded in quality from one movie to the next. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another exciting journey through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry is trying to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry is always at work, it seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all of his actions, slowly, consciously and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry movies to be made in the 80s, the Sudden Impact lacks a part of the 70's feeling that characterizes the first three films. This doesn't mean it's quality is anything less. Bottom line: Full of intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.
