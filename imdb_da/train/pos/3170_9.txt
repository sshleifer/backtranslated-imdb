Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones is on his way to good things. It was the mindset I had after seeing his feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely does an independent film make me feel as good as his did. Clearly written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you involved from the beginning to the end. Adam Jones may not be a known name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "Named Actors" it would be a Box Office sensation. I think it still has a chance of being watched by a main stream audience if only a movie distributor takes the time to work this movie. No matter where it ends, if you get a chance to see it, you won't be disappointed.
