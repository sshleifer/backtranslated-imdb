In 1948, this was my all-time favorite movie. Betty Grable costumes were so convincing that I would grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the dashing Hungarian officer. Silly and fluffy, as this movie might be seen initially when I was eight years old, it seemed to me to be important about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was surprised to find out that it still did.
