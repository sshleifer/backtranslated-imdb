I just can't believe these games can get so much better, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even though I hit it, I can't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I have to own all of them, even though I have beaten them many times. I hope they never stop making this kind of game, even if the series is coming to an end. <br /> <br />
