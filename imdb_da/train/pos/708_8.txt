An ok movie about down syndrome. A mother has twins one is very ill the other is good, but he has lows. The mother doesn't think she can raise him so she gives him some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs! the mother does not like this and she thinks he should be with his family (I agree) so they take it to court and the family is broken up and the grandparents lose, it never really says if mother and daughter make up? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has a few unintentional laughs!
