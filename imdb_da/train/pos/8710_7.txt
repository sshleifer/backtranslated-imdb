I can remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it frightened me confidently. <br /> <br /> I would love to visit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember, though I suspect my tastes and demands have changed. <Although this was released before strangers and an abundance of other space players, I suppose it has its roots in scary films from the 50s and the political climate of the 70s. When I think about it, it was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become gloomy and is going to be the term for any movie having spaceships in them.
