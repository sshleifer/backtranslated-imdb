Spoilers! Classic 70's six trash can! The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this film so great. She was beautiful, but what really was for me was how sexual she was. She ejected massive amounts of sexuality throughout the film. Her best scenes were, when she was, stimulating herself. Every time she was on the screen I was transfixed. <br /> <br /> Also, Doctor Julia (sister of the film's dimwitted male focus) was very interesting visually. Although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use the little she had, and her scenes (especially the silk blouse and black skirt scenes) also grabbed my attention effortlessly. You must also love the big hoaky scene where the bats stripped her neck; I don't know if I've ever seen anything more ridiculous yet sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
