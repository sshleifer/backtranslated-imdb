This is a great movie to suit everyone, but the very youngest, although accessibility for younger people was destroyed (at least in the print I saw) using an unfortunate choice of English subtitles! Too much of the movie is almost impossible to guess in what time period it is set - there is no modern technology, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bike, just a veil, almost black and white everyday life, against which there is contrast to the dazzling view of Sezuan Opera and of festive fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their impending departure to a war site, it can still be anywhere in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see a car - the late 30s, early 40s style - and we realize that we see a China on the brink of major upheavals and that much The world we see is being swept away in the Second World War disaster and the Communist revolution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues that are vital, even today, both in China and in other parts of the world : inequality between boys and girls, men and women; The trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm reading too much into this movie; but I don't think so! I also think it is a scandal that films of this caliber are often not displayed in the UK while dross is rejected as quality material. <br /> <br /> But don't let me start on that. .
