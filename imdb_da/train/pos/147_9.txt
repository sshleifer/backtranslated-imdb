The stories in this video are very entertaining and definitely worth a visit! The first is about a young couple who have hit the forest by two rednecks, with a large but inexplicable twist at the end. The probe is the best of the party and it alone makes it worth it. A man is attacked by a dog that he fears to be rabid. He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds out employees who are not exactly what they seem to be ...... Great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10/10 ! If the others were on par with this one, this would get 10/10! The third is the weakest of the pile - A girl meets some guys and has wild sex! There seems to be no point in the story to the end with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the terrible first part! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a great movie that won't make you wrong at all! Worth having a rental!
