I was not only an extra in this movie, I saw it in Boston for a sold out movie theater. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans got stuck in a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star are this sweet comedy about love and desire. Love is between the two young lovers. Wish the Red Sox wins the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and makes it laugh most. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. At times, I felt that supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world this is just a fun movie.
