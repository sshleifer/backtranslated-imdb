This movie is worth watching for the visual beauty and moving alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtitle of alienation. Women and artists (both brought together in a leading role in a transvestite star) are both doomed to be referred to entertaining roles in China. This makes the unlikely bond between an old street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the original culture. The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the volume to swell with emotions made unnecessary by the actors' performance. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer action movies.
