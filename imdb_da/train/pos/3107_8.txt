Picking up just after the Moscow showdown of Supremacy is this Bourne's greatest adventure and his ultimate climax. Through the tight 115-min runtime, the film Bourne from Russia takes to Madrid, Paris, Morocco and ultimately New York. Damon is every inch of the heavily trained murderer Robert Ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the underpinning feelings of his character that make him so credible, and that's exactly the way Damon manages to combine These two polar opposites of themselves that are so breathtaking. In the third, Bourne is on a mission to save her soul, and while Ultimatum delivers such a high octane performance, you will find yourself sweating and shuddering over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look out for two big bodies and a battle scene as realistic as Bond vs Shaw back in '63. Director Greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller, and it's as exciting as movie players get; a real pay-off for Bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.
