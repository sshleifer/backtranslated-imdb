Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this - everyone else in the film is also good. The dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene where Lemmon's character tries to clear his sinuses in a restaurant rolls me on the floor with laughter every time I see it. Anyone who happened to see the not so great successor should not be turned away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones adds only to hilariousness in my opinion. These two big guys made a number of movies together, but one is the best - no doubt.
