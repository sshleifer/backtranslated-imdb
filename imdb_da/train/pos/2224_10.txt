A female fines (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on the death row before they meet their maker. And what a way to go. Lucky this movie is not real or we would have many more people in this world on death row. It really starts slowly. Low light and poor play, like most (B) movies. It gets better as it moves together. And ending with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very high on the low cost, very sexy 90s movies. It is a must see when the kids are away or in bed.
