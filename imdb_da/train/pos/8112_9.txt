Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells handle this extraordinary expectation film, with ambition and scope hard to find today. They predict World War II and the way Britain was attacked and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. They change the timing; in the film, the war and space research are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it is amazing. We even see a helicopter. The movie is older than them. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists working Roman with helmets: If you can look through the fun costumes, appreciate the state-of-the-art 30's architecture from Wells vision a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power and John Cabal as an archetype for the adventurous and inventive person, who chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring as the final monologue from John Cabal.
