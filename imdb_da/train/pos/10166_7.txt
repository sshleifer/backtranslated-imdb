I saw this on an 8 hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and altitude) I actually found it mildly entertaining (emphasis on the "gentle"). The real idea behind the movie was brilliant: A woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with another, she decided to make sure they didn't come together, but eventually she let them do it. Unfortunately, the actual movie wasn't that good. OK, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay-but-non-gay friend part of the story could have been working much better. The talking parrot was a good idea, but to be honest: it wasn't really much fun. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was close call.
