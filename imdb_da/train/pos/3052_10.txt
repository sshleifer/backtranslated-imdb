Strange but emotionally disturbing cooler about the daring medieval man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly overpowering father (Donald Sutherland) while he sees a shrink (John Ritter) and flirt with another patient (Neve Campbell). Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "American Beauty", "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are stand-outs here. Remarkable debut for first-time writer / director Henry Bromell. I'm surprised this movie didn't get a chance to stay at theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
