I was in France around March 5, and I love going to this film festival. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It hasn't caused the impact to me like the Mexican users, because it was French subtitle, but it's still shocking. <br /> <br /> This movie is a satire on urban violence, kidnapping and street crime in Mexico. It is a raw portrait of the city. By a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with an amazing Mia Maestro, also a satire for kidnapping, but almost with a more serious tone, and I think there is some connection to Cero y van 4. A, a kind of redemption story and where much is too much? Man on fire, who was amazingly strong, was also not a satire, but a raw portrait in the streets of Mexico. Or it's like The Brave One. A movie that shocks and hits you in the intestines very hard. It's like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists, but it makes it even more credible. Rating: A movie that chokes and makes you believe there is no longer street security. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie you won't soon forget. Lets you shake and stunned.
