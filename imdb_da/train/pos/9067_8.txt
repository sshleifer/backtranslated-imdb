After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed seeing "Fried Worms". For once I didn't guess the end! It was fun and entertaining and didn't take into account a lot of serious humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both LOVED it too - oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family movie that is not only tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He doesn't stop singing just to annoy me !!" Also the way the new child tries to make friends and how these friendships are actually formed is right in the way the children behave. Of course, the parents have to act a little shabby - but my favorite scenes involved father turn to his new job. Have fun!
