This game showed only one season, but was exciting for the audience because it required visual suitability and a stable hand. A false motion would disqualify the participant from winning the prize, even though it was clear, the knowledge knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the participants started drawing, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; so the other participant can easily win the competition. It was a fun show, but it was clear that the participants were often embarrassed by a silly mistake that was unintentional. Rarely did the game show survive a single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it turned out to be rather unpopular, although the game shows made a big return to the television screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game exhibition and one that has not yet been seen again.
