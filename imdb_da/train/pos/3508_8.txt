Incredibly exciting and captivating, I found it impossible to turn around when I began to see. I'm usually one of the toughest critics, but for me, this movie was just brilliant, weird, as it may sound like I could almost smell the air and feel the textures on the sites. <br /> <br /> From a movie, I thought there was a lot of light and texture. From the orange glow of the summer light to the plastic-wrapped sofa, everyone had a clear air of realism for me. <br /> <br /> From a character perspective, I thought of the concept of Victor Vargas as almost the glue connecting the story was completely inspired, each of the other family members having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself. <br /> <br /> Besides having known someone like grandmother and having been at the receiving end of just such a situation, I can say that the situation felt very realistic. The awkward, accent, cooking and even down to the comments made me feel so authentic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started to see it without expectations and found it completely submerged and reminded of teenage feelings, worth a visit.
