I was surprised that '' The Secret Fury '' was an enjoyable good movie ...... Probably because I had no expectations for this movie ..... Although the movie has it's plot holes ... .. I would say that you couldn't guess who was behind the whole scheme until the end of the movie ..... First, I thought it was Robert Ryan who used the same method as 'Gaslight', where man tries To run his wife crazy, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the movie is that they are running in a completely different direction, which did not give signs at the beginning. ..... I thought Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert bore their parts well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a nice character actress who steals scenes in this ...... Those who like movies , it keeps you guessing will like this ......
