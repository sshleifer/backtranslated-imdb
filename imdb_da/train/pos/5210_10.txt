It's a shame that she didn't get screen credit, she had by far the best job in the movie girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. She had much more influence than Avril, or almost everyone else in the movie. She made almost S / M look like fun! She was really trustworthy, having the S / M model, which gets scared of her situation. Although they seem to have really destroyed that kind of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, these sets were very well-built, but they kind of foamed the surface of what was being shot. This is a movie where both cuts should be made available. It looks like they've been beating a lot of what was shot, and almost all the really dark things that would have made the movie much more demented. It kind of like they stopped short of the brand they were supposed to wear during the recording. What was shot would not have been given an R-rating, probably an NC-17 or X, but that was what would have been necessary to make the movie the way it should have been.
