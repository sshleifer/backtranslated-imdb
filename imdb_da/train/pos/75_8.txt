The great Vincent Price has made many amazing Horror movies, some of which are among the greatest genre gems of all time. The greatest achievement of the prize was undoubtedly his film in the 60s, with films such as Roger Corman's brilliant Poe cycle (still the biggest Horror cycle of the time), Michael Reeves' Witchfinder General (1968) or Ubaldo Ragona's "The Last Man on Earth "(1964) marks the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career. The films that made the man famous and thereby created him the immortal Horror icon, he is back to the 50s, with "House of Wax" (1953), marking his rise to the star. "The Mad Magician" from 1954 follows a plot similar to much of its successful predecessor. However, this is not to say that this movie is not an original, lovely macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself. As the above lines may indicate, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything that the man has been in, none of my fellow human beings can miss this little gem. <br /> <br /> Price stars like Don Galico (aka. Galico the Great), an undervalued master magician and inventor of magic units, whose boss, a shabby businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him. When the boss takes out one of Galicia's brilliant inventions and gives it to his rival, The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico, begins and a murderous shelf begins ... <br /> <br /> Not we love Vincent Price when he is out for revenge? Some of his most famous and best films such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) were about absurd and lovely macabre revenge killings, and this former film in his Horror career is another proof of that nobody takes revenge as Vincent Price does. This film provides a wonderful eccentric leading role for Price, which always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of unobtrusive entertaining and macabre fun for any horror fan. Another must-see for my fellow price fans.
