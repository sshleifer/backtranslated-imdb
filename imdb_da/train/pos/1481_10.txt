Now, today, some people see a movie without film styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, change what we expect in a movie, maybe Casomai is no more-independent American movie, the movie takes all the movie resources and language to tell us a simple story of love and marriage, but much more. Full of views, lectures and lets you think ... and you are sure you could not be drilled a second of a long 116 minutes. I estimate that there is no single scene longer than 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.
