I found the memorable quotes searching for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... Old Person 1: You know I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: You can remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: And I remember you fell for it, hook line and sink. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Oh, I didn't. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and left with the army boys to fight the Martians. Old Person 2: Aren't you dead yet?
