How amazing this movie is! I've seen it over and over again over the years and I'm always spellbound of it. The reason why the film is so easy to look at again is, of course, the arrest ability that young Bette Davis has given. She not only steals all the scenes she is in, but is actually much more beautiful and photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films she had made so far at her home studio Warner Brothers (this movie was made by RKO Radio Pictures). She has a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh the lovely big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so curved when she was young. Get a lot of it in the cheap negligee she carries for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And Oh, she's an absolute powerhouse in that scene. Howard is a little nervous all the way through, but he captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee scores like the sweet, beautiful young Sally who really loves him. The Max Steiner score is both charming and exciting. Beautiful performances and thirties taste make this the version of the classic novel.
