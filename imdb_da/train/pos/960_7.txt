This is a movie that has many things that only Japanese people can understand. Although well translated, there are some things that are, of course, private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it was trying to send a message of some sort, but it just wasted me. <br /> <br /> What I felt is basically, it's a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some children become "one" and ultimately have almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense at all. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azuma prayer wash yokai and the one who looks like a big tongue umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart!) I couldn't really distinguish the plot. br /> <br /> Bottom line: Beautiful visuals, the baby screams a lot, the river princess is terribly sweet, and the rest is bad.
