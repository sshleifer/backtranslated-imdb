In the 70s, Charlton played Heston in sci-fi flicks of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the better ones. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn finds out the eerie truth about this product, he finds himself on the run. <br /> <br /> I guess it's only natural that this movie should be dated to us today. However, it still brings interesting questions about what will become our agriculture. Also with Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in their final role).
