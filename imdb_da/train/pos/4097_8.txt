Youth, sexuality and the French landscape - one of the more unique movies you will ever see. If you can see it, it is not something that considers how difficult it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It is sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting and occasionally fun. A little bit boring also in the middle, but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre movies before you have seen this one at least once.
