This would have worked much better if it had been made as "Mitchell in Malta." At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean landscape dressed in the ridiculously-looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger. Mitchell was Mitchell, the movie would not have suffered from a lack of free police brutality. Oh good. At least, the comic comments from Mike and Bots came to this fun fare as an episode of the MST. However, I cannot imagine seeing it on my own.
