Ang Lee likes to tap into a movie, to capture action, characters and attitude on the hip as they appear. It is an ideal approach that covers the arbitrary conclusion of the American Civil War through the unhappy actions of a young militia, unformed or in thought. The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramic pictures in the middle of the south as a quiet character that continues the battle as a hard-parent. <br /> <br /> James Schamus's script is probably the standard carrier for this movie; Close behind it are a number of well-designed performances that carry it admirably. Jeffrey Wright's name alone could carry this movie to me. He is brilliant here, but in a slow burning role: Instead, we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) beliefs from a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> A noble, optimistic movie. One to see if you don't fancy the tougher, more bittersweet Cold Mountain or The Claim, for example. 10.7
