There are probably sad stories about women and their suppression of religious, political and social means. In order not to diminish the films and stories of genital mutilation and reproductive rights as well as inequality in wages and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or another ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to just take another approach and put light on the subject . <br /> <br /> The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. Passions are high and more women are trying to pamper themselves as men to enter the battle. <br /> <br /> The women caught (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution gave a fun and shining insight into the country's customs and probably all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both town and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter gave some fun moments when we believed why they have such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a paternalistic society that feels the need to save the women from its human red behavior. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> When we see the changes in the responsible soldiers and reflect the Iranian community, it is not surprising that this film will not play any Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those who can see it.
