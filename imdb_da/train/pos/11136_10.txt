"Midnight Cowboy" is one of the movies that has been proclaimed a masterpiece for good reason - it is truly one of the finest movies ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a great success when it was originally released. But be warned, it is also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded not to give us the Hollywood ending, which was basically mandatory in the 80s. Still, that's why I treasure the years 1967 to 1977 for American film. It's a time when well-made, innovative and most precious movies could be made with the big budgets Hollywood could offer. All this was over when "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger's guide makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental edits. Unlike many other films with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has quite a good age. It is still as strong now as it was when it was originally released. The action, however, is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters' background is never fully explained, but the notion makes them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, I was a fan of vintage exploit movies, I loved the scenes put on the infamously sleazy 42nd street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful movies ever made.
