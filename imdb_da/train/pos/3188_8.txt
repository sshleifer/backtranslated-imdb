I almost had the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled on this cute movie, then it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a streetlamp. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I saw only for two reasons: VERA ELLEN'S LEGS. But it really is so much more. The reason is actually quite smart and creative tissue. It's almost like a Shakespeare comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And of course there is ... VERA ELLEN'S LEGS. The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection at Mill Creek Entertainment) does not have the best video quality and I have heard the same about the Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are a little too high, so many of the scenes seem to be bleaching, especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can stumble with the controls on your television to compensate. I can only imagine what it looked like on the big screen back in '51. The scenes, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and wonderfully scary - sort of in a "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" friend. <br /> <br /> As far as romance is concerned, this is just perfect. Not sappy, not constructed, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, your bad schmucks, your miserable life will never be as charming as this. Has has. Wait, what am I doing? My life sucks just as bad as yours. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.
