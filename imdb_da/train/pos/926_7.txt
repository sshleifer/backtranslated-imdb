I do not know why some criticize it so much. <br /> <br /> It's a really fun show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are fun and all in all most comedy shows. The supporting characters are absolutely fun. Map of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are just above average but no matter how often you have under-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> This show was well worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
