Poor Ivy: Although the way she was born, she had an accident marrying a charming drain (Richard Ney). Since the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when the rigid Victorian ideas from the class began to break at the edges, this uncertain status worsens her wrong. Gretorexes (because they are called) do not know where their next shillings come from, but there are boating parties and fancy-skirts in nice pleasaces that are able to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) acquainted with a wealthy elder (Herbert Marshall, who must be born in the Middle Ages), she puts one of his extraordinary chapeaux to him. Fortunately, one of the beaux she still stretches together (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison as she asks her hubby's farewell. The fact that it involves Knowles does not phase her a little, even though the hours drop by until he hangs at the neck of death. The rotation of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowle's loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face delivers the rest.
