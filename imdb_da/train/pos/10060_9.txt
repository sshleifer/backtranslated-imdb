Wang Bianlian is an old street performer known as a "king of masks" for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that precious art must not die with Wang, and so he sows an heir to his mind. The film is about prejudice, men's domination, art, values ​​and most importantly warmth. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It is a long story that has been edited so well that the length of the movie is only 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it's an artistic movie, the next five minutes it's a sad movie, the next five minutes it's a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood as its protagonist changes its face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. History and script are flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both main characters are artists, you can tell how they performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. The year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK, and if 'English patient' said the less the better. See it 9/10.
