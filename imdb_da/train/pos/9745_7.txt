As another commented, this is a good movie. It has glorious scenery and Luciano's marvelous voice! I've seen this movie many times and saw it again this afternoon. I had forgotten how much I miss Pavarotti's song by Nessun Dorma and I need to get out on the CD! It's a great movie for just while you're away in the afternoon immersed in fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is grand as an agent and just over the top, but all agents are just that anyway. The Italian landscape is beautiful but no tops balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need to trade with the Olivier ratio, this movie is not for you. If you just want a fancy flight and some wonderful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
