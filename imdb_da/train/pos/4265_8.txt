If you haven't seen this unclear little charm, find out. It's the story of a bumbling war-time Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) listed 4-F every time he tries to join any branch of the military. He finds a magic lamp that of course contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending him over time to serve in all the wrong times and places than he wants. It's sweet, cheerful, and fluffy, and you can't help but suffer. The ceilings are much like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both made many Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, but not together. Needless to say, it all goes well for everyone, and the viewer goes away and feels pretty good.
