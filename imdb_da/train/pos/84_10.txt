I used this movie in a religion class I learned. The golden fish swims happily in its bowl in an apartment on the top floor. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy has got money to buy milk. On his way home, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him stands a man in a black suit who looks a little scary. The boy puts the bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in the black dress gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. A black cat climbs the fire and enters the apartment. He (?) Discovers the fish bowl and sees it. The fish is energetic and flips out of the bowl. Now a lot of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in the mouth and we keep all the weather. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The dual story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a good discussion starting in my class.
