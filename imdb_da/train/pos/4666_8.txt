It is very blurred for all the 60s watching the movie. The mood is pretty gentle, but it grew much more on me than expected. Cast is top notch and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov walks through the film, mumbling some very funny things under his breath, and it's all very unnoticed; I want to buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The reason is that Ustinov, as a scam released from prison, is a computer whiz and confusing money from an American firm with offices in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while and looking at her being fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual deadpan himself, and Karl Malden has fun as the dense and shabby leader who runs the London office. The end is fun and neatly cynical.
