Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. Artemisia was taught by his father, Artemisia, in an era that refused talented women the right to have their work side by side art created by men. Her tragic life is chronic in this biographical film directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> After reading the short story "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, we got to explore more about this woman's life, her work and her heritage. We also read Mary Garrard's "Artemisia Gentileschi", which must be a must read book by all art lovers. "Artemisia" presents the fictional facts we have read about showing the early life of youth as she begins to paint. She was clearly influenced by her father's father, Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters during that period. Her relationship and love affair with Tassi is the foundation of the film. Unfortunately, Artemisia could not go as far as she could because of prejudice against women in art. It also didn't help her cause a scandal where she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to travel to Rome to get away from the unhappy time in her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi makes a beautiful Artemisia. She is a beautiful creature that aroused passion in men. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy finish that Benoit Delhoms camera captures in all its splendor. The scenic places in the film give an idea of ​​what inspired the picturesque school to show in their canvas. Krishna Levy's music serves well what we see. Agnes Merlik aimed with a certain hand that showed her own visual style.
