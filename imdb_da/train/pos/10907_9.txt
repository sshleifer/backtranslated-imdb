Was flipping around on the TV and HBO showed a double whammy of incredibly terrible medical conditions so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, it looks funny" - I really love documentaries - so we started to see it . At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but it was explained that because of his condition he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, a little more, laughed, came up to get another Kleenex, and cried a little more. When Jonny Kennedy's "time was up," he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; He had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
