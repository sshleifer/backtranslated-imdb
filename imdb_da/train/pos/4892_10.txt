This was a wonderfully smart and entertaining movie that I will never tire of seeing many, many times. Castings were magnificent when matching the young people with the older figures. There are those of us here who really appreciate good actors and an intelligent history format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any kind of production, where she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a great actress and a pleasure to see as every transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an excellent picture, for most of the moving images recently made lack good characters, good scripts and good plays. The film staff need heroes, non-deviant manicures, who lack ingenuity and talent. How nice to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the prizes it deserves. Thanks again for a great evening entertainment. I congratulate the author, director, producer and all those who did a good job.
