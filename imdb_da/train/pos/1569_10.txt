I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats so different from each other, but they collectively refer to themselves as 'brothers'. I find myself often trying to imitate their tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis or even Gordon's Scottish district. There must be several episodes about Human Kimberly. The cats section hides as pre-teen girls to access Human Kimberly's dormant party to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a fun classic. We can't drink rootbeer in our house now without either making Catscratch voices or Hanson Brothers from the movie 'Slap Shot.' Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on the DVD ??
