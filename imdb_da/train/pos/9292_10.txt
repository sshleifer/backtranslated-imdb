If you like movies, don't miss this one. If you prefer action, or horror or romance, then you wonder what happens. Everyone here is stuck in a gangster movie. And what happens is transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are few similar films. No doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find. But the search will be worth it. If you want to study a mile as a potential symbol then it is actually a movie to study. <br /> <br /> You can't see it once. If you do, you will never see what happens. Dark City is better. Joe vrs. The volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism. . . or at least think twice before recording again.
