I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their beliefs, you will find that they do not. I do not know. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises Christ made from a resurrection. So even though the worst would happen and we die while we hold on to our integrity, Jehovah will be able to rectify this. It is really a simple question: Is God true to you or is it all that you think? If he is genuine and you trust him, you will follow his directions, no matter what short-term results may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in capital letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were able to only blood transfusion save my life, would it be a good time to anger, the only one who could turn me to life when the time came? She didn't get it - God is just not enough for her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort that a strong faith gives.
