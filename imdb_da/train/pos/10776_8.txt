"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also leads the film and writes the music score - of course. The film is a portrait of the northern Italian provincial life, in the Emilia Romagna area. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radios - one of the boys in the movie creates "Radioraptus". Youth wishes, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also speaks of substances. Freccia, the protagonist, is the victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; The spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of managing too. Of course, Luciano "League" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professor. First of all, he is a musician. But he succeeds in making a good product. Unfortunately, he does not repeat the success of his second movie "Da zero a dieci" - not at all good. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" actors are generally not very well known, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. Look in a small role another Italian songwriter -Francesco Guccini, he is the cozy communist bartender and football coach!
