Blood Castle is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being shown in Italy in the 60s. The movie has all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most any movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The story relates to a haunted castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero makes an effort to stay overnight in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It is night every year when the dead return to revive their death. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I see in the movie is running time. It feels almost padded. There is a large part of the first action where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbled around in the dark and found nothing of interest. But when he finds something, the film gets up and becomes totally entertaining. Blood Castle is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian gothic horror in general.
