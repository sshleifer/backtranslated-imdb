"Our song" gives us the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - the best girlfriends hang out in late summer. Youth Summer - although we do not know the signals and landmarks on this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is / was the same for all of us. A lazy respite from school pressure and tumult. Welcome warmth and availability. <br /> <br /> But if this youthful experience is universal, the 90's inner city is somewhere other than most of us - perhaps as a foreign country. Young bodies carving new silhouettes ... waving new territory ... the maze against adulthood. The young mind comes in itself and speaks for itself and says that it is who I am, that is who I will try to be. It is / was always that way. But that's how it plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the author / director of this movie project, but he acknowledges anyone who has cried out on him. The opening title image `A movie of 'seems to mention everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the movie we know it to be real. [The closing titles also have some of the most on-the-money and grateful credits I've read.] The live sound recording of Jan McLaughlin deserves to be specially noted. McKay is a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it's his three graces Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the right thing, their interactions have the fire in true friendship and focus on reality. This is not a music video shorthand tale about teenage life. It has the severity of the long blinking stirring. <br /> <br /> Hanging on with them, we do not feel completely included, but we feel privileged to listen in. These are real voices that speak with wisdom about the crises and the dullness of daily life. We are witness to modern math in teen life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed up and resolved. Small scenes illustrate great thoughts throughout. Lanisha is associated with her father in his security job - that is the only way she can spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them, but also the failures of family and paternity. In a coherent scene, Lanisha defends her father for her mother, and we see how desperate she needs to love both of them and to love her in return. Later, they lay three friends in the dark and shared visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny children are and more tragic, how realism hangs in idealism these days. And in the end, Maria, who just goes down the street, is a short story in itself. We see her gathering courage to keep all her fears and doubts in check. She demonstrates to us the strength to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life alive. <br /> <br /> "Our song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply at the frighteningly ephemeral nature of friendship - One day, living and alive, the intimacy of the next can only turn and drift away. It's terrible, but that's just the way it is?
