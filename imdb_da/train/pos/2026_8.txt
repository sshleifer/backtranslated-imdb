I first saw this mini-series some years ago on British television and was immediately imprisoned by history. This rather surprised me as I am not a big fan of either 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I think the former heroine is a self-righteous drilling and the last piece of work as an overblown claptrap. <br /> <br /> "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the movie were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, Yorkshire's breathtaking wild and beautiful landscape, and Toby Stephens' sexual magnetism. <br /> <br /> This movie successfully illustrates the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of minor domestic governor who portrayed the treatment of women in the Markham household. At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is subjected to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. She runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom, but as a mysterious woman living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-sleeve Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (despite the terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is more than able to play the central role in the movie. Tara is worthy and secluded, while we can see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves is the depraved but curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who played her sister Rose and Simon Carter, who is uncharitable president with a taste for the good things in life. Finally, I could see the movie for Toby Stephens alone; he is so beautiful, robust, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseating sentimental way). I'm not even sure he's a good actor, as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a bug in the movie, it is using flashbacks that I felt both disturbed with history's history and made it a bit confusing. Other people who have seen this movie with me also had problems with this, and I found that I had to explain to them that some scenes were actually retrospective. I am very grateful to those responsible for making this movie. Not only did I make the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy Anne Brontet's amazing novel. Of course, it was better than the movie, but only with a narrow margin. I recommend that everyone interested watch the movie and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
