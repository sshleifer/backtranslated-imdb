Went to watch this Finnish movie and I have to say that this is one of the better movies I've seen this year. The interior consists of 5-6 different stories, all of which take place the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very nicely in the end and may be reminiscent of how Tarantino's films are made. Most of the actors have performed very well, which is certainly necessary in realistic dramas of this type. I especially enjoyed the actor of Sanna Hietala, the leading actress and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed btw that IMDB has got the wrong information about Sanna. Her name, which you may have noticed in my review;) is not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
