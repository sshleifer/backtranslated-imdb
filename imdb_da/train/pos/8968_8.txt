This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be human, is amazing, her subtle facial expression, her every move and gesture creates all of Gillian's unique and somewhat scary character, she left us hanging on her every word. I should not neglect to mention Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester's highly commendable notions as the Scottish loving writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who may seem to stop using magic even when it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully finished, and chemistry between them is great, but then again, when is chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad!
