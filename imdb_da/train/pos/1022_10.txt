Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for that role. I love the connection between the characters. If you haven't seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star trek much of the time, it may not be because it is completely different. I'm a star trek fan, but I would definitely rate this show well over any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get the Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it, I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not here yet, so I can't see it for some time depressing). But this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is very addictive. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
