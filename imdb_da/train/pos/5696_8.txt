What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star involved in drugs and murder and then died of AIDS? You make a movie of course. The likely reason why it was not done earlier is that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of his production. So it is no coincidence that the film was made only a moment after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There is too much material here to require dull filler scenes. Casting is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a number of films, so here was finally a role that is perfectly suited to him. Bosworth is sweet, so it's irrelevant how she works (she's solid), and McDermott, who is rather annoying, is pretty good, largely because he has so much facial hair that I didn't recognize him first. (I wish they did it to cross in each movie so I didn't have to see his stupid face.) I didn't manage to acknowledge Christina Applegate and wouldn't have known she was in it if I didn't had seen his name in the final credits. Kudrow is charming as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst television sitcom at all times.) The only casting choices that were questionable were an early near como by Carrie Fischer and the utterly absurd involvement of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I would include Paris Hilton too? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second look as a stupid head. Because the film is about decadence, among other things ?? and about a porn actress ?? She fits in perfectly.
