this step was friggin fun !!! Funniest I've seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chickens are also warm. The story is great, lots of good jokes, and the one who has gone through this before me is an idiot. To him I say that you are not of Indian background, so you do not understand humor you moron. do not rate movies you do not understand. What did you see, the subtitle version, where the majority of jokes are lost in translation? That was what I thought Jackass was. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor ever and again shows his versatility, he can not only act but also comedy and is excellent at it. John also proved himself, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent in it.
