OK, so soldier is not deep and meaningful as Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2, but on the whole I found it quite fun. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in character, not speaking and being almost emotionally made moments when his humanity broke through the more poignant. I found his portrayal of limited emotional development more touching than Arnies in the T-movies (and before I get any comments yes, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human, but the premise of both films was the same). <Br /> <br /> So to the movie itself is a reasonably priced American / Brit cast that meat out this little story. Not sure whether Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or goodies, so it was not possible to decide whether or not I liked them. The colony was a little more realistic, nor was it a wild bunch of peace-cutting / happy / fake hicks that were wiped out of the prisoner's go or a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike perhaps Escape from LA - successors are such incredible creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really made his late father proud by continuing the family's noble Sci-Fi relationship. And the rest of the cast helped eradicate this pathetic band of people who get the most out of a bad situation and don't do too badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this on your TV schedule, I recommend giving it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.
