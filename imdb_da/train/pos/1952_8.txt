I had to watch the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India. I must say that the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down the back. The basic principle makes me think about what makes certain addicts decide to move on, while others still remain addicted ... but I felt that Diane Keaton was her best ... the scene she wanted and started shaking her home for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is .... Scripture is well done as film and direction .. and casting <br /> <br /> A must see movie ..... for everyone
