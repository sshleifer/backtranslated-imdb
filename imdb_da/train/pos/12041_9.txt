This is a plain old spooky ghost story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club and they were kept spellbound until the end! No blood or gore - just good old-fashioned excitement. It starts right from the beginning and builds and builds. The end is a real twist that has made me work. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well-acted. It is also a "period piece" - set in the 1920s, which was added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> It's a shame it's not easily accessible on DVD. My copy is VHS. This, along with "Haunted" is probably two of the best Ghost Stories I ever have the scene. What just shows that a little creativity goes "in your face" does any day!
