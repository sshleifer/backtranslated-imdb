I collect at least a few people who saw it on September 2 on TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came to the United States. It was a great scandal, and I am collecting that the original release in the United States was then chopped up by censors that it was virtually incomprehensible. I watched because I had just seen a documentary about "bad women" actors in the American pre-film censorship board created in the early 30s. It looked like they were getting away with much more than Hedy's most "sensational" shot in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looked positively innocent in this, according to today's standards, and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty. It was a lovely, lyrical movie to relax on. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I saw it after recording it during a sleepless early A.M. I would love to see the first version released in the US for comparison.
