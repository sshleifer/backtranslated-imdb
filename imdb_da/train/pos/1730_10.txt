This unsung silent gem tells the true story of a POW escape during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is brilliant and rings very true. In fact, an unusual all-round authenticity puts this head and shoulders above most warpics.
