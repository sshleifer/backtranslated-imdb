Maybe the biggest movie ever about jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot continues to haunt my reverie. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a pleasure (see also the Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; It is available on CD. All lovers of jazz and film noir will study this amazing jewel. What shadows and lights - what music - what a hat!
