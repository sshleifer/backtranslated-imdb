This film was released the year I was born and will be like me, 70 in 2007. I saw it again last night, since I hadn't seen it since high school. While it was filled with 30-day feeling and the play was a bit stereotypical, it was still amazing. Pearl S. Buck's story came alive through the magic of chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel, which served Ms. The Buck Nobel Prize for Literature comes alive under the relay of Sydney Franklin, who, along with an excellent script, tells the peasant farmer's story, Wang Lung whose father gets a break for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Bucks history, Wang's success is substantiated by his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the country's love. Finally, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Bucks stories always had strong women cast in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. German-born Luise Rainer brings to life a provisional but definite peasant Chinese woman in her portrayal of Olan. Muni also captures the naive, but honorable Wang, who eventually caught between the rich and peasant two worlds. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Chancellor Uncle Henry of the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly like Mia, conniving Uncle and Keye Luke as number one son - but this time, not Charlie Chans. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie you can see over and over again and never tire of. If it really is, this movie is a classic, no doubt at all.
