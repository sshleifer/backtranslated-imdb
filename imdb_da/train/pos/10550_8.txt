I saw this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a UK distributor. Well, it doesn't, because this movie is all a Hollywood movie isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems that no one today really wants to see this type of movie, as in the simplest terms it does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers are looking for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I have ported I have written a review for IMDb for many years but felt inclined to give this movie a special mention, even though it is in my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it's about nothing, as the two main characters are thrown into their own world of nothing through a hatred of the world. The brilliance here is how the director holds interest through the majority of the maturity with only two characters, and when the only mise-one scene consists of a half house and a large white empty space. This is largely due to the actors' stellar performances, both of which give some great laughs while adding a significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I'd love to write a little more, but have the right time. But I urge everyone and everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-run way with the combination of good performances, a strong script, a good sound design and (pretty) impressive visuals that create a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame, so few people know about nothing ....
