"Castle of Blood" (aka "Terror Castle") is a well-crafted, surprising ghostly entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white filmography, flawless dubbing, excellent casting, rather logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though quite appropriate) stop putting this one apart. Only the movies sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt 'first-sight love' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) are an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie. While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub and tells one of his ghost stories to count Blackwood. Acknowledging the great writer Alan, a young news reporter, is requesting an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Amazingly, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night at Blackwood Castle, one night after Halloween when the dead go. Alan can't afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10-pound bet. <br /> <br /> Contrary to Mario Bava's practice of "Black Sunday" ("The Mask of Satan"), "Blood Castle" rather limited, making the few moments of violence even more terrible, especially surprising from an instructor usually associated with the terrible Italian space films of the 60s. It's a pity that the only version of this movie I've found is badly worsened (and busy) pan and scan version. Still, it is worth seeing and crying for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in Elizabeth's role. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well to Robert Wise 'The Haunting'.
