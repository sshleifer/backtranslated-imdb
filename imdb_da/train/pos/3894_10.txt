I wish I could laugh again as much as when I first saw this show. I haven't done it ever since. <br /> <br /> The weird thing is, I find myself laughing just as hard after seeing the show over and over again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultured, exciting, is a man of the world. He is kind and talks about politics and does not feel the need to "engage" in political discussion. He's over it. I would contrast him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people of his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The most fun guy on Earth
