I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen for a very long time. It was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in many different ways. Have recommended it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and love. It showed how we not only have life with our families; but also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them, as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we do not do, we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another such movie and will watch me.
