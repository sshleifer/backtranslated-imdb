For a long time, it seemed that all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and (I guessed) every other rank filled the top slots and it left dregs for the six comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: in spite of the outlandish plots that are typical of farces, the actors seemed to try to put something into their characters, and what we the viewer came back was almost a true suspension of faith. As extras from the music video attacked the evicting police, you almost thought it was possible. If you are a fan of some of the better sex colors (Canadian or not), you should definitely seek it out. And the big surprise, this sex farce is also filled with some very good nudity.
