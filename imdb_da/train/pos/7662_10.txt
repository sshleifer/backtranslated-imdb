As B-movies go, it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal some key elements in the plot or other parts of the movie even though I'm trying to minimize such a trend). As followers usually go, it was absolutely fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. Despite this sometimes tedious trend, it seemed to work in this movie as long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original "scanners". <br /> <br /> The movie was similar in ways to the "Superman" series regarding the main character's description of his early childhood and his relationship with his parents (who seemed modeled in the same way as Kents in the "Superman" stories) and the theme for a morally pure hero possessed by extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. The depiction of deep feelings of alienation of astonishing or otherwise non-parent children, youth and / or adults was a theme reminding me of films such as "Real Genius" and (more superficially) "Doctor Mordrid" and hit a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The movie had a positive message and was fun to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of portraying certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and even deeply touching at times. These moments arose occasionally among all the great formal-driven schlock and free sex (uality, in this case, the sexual elements were tastefully finished) and violence that makes B-movies (or Shakespearian plays for that matter!) So much fun to see! <br /> <br /> This is a must see for all comics, sci-fi, remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles, the film can develop a pretty cult sequencer along with the original "Scanners".
