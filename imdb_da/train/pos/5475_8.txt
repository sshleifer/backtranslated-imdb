Finally, is the undeveloped version of "Baby Face" surfaces and from which source? Library of Congress. They restored four minutes, excerpts here and there, creating a much better movie. We now know that Baby Face was hit by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years old. Another reason for her behavior and cold is the exterior. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is truly amazing in the role of Lily Powers (note the moniker), a part that just required the right amount of sexuality plunged with power, oblique, and revenge, but things with virgin disgrace when asked That, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. Barbara Stanwyck presents the nuances needed to show that, although she sleeps high to the top (literally), she still has good in her heart - note how she treats the few who have been kind to her like Chico (the amazing actress Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And even though she exploits her sexuality to make a bunch of men who are rich and powerful, the same men try to exploit her for their carnal desires without intentions of permanent bonding until they fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers first understands that emotions are hard to ride, it's easy to lose control. One possible result is death. Hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but it is ephemeral and it is a cold solitary location. <br /> <br /> A word has to be said about Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, whose will to power is stressed in "Baby Face" by the older philosopher who turns to Lilly as she still turns tricks to her old man. "Baby Face" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is very unlikely that the half-lit Hitler understood much about Nietzsche, he regarded himself as a Nietzschean to the nth degree and adorned it along his other rantings. "Baby Face" serves as an accusation of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will for the concept of power, especially in the final stages. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the cutest little baby face." is a theme for "Baby Face", an even more narrative and useful melody is WC Handy's "St. Louis Blues" played throughout the movie, especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes. "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely towards the end when Lily begins to look beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico sings a raw, salacious version of "St. Louis Blues" when Lily, who now disagrees with the texts, orders her to stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the movie more modern in its approach and attitude to sex as power than many a new Hollywood release. In every way, see this gem from the distant past and enjoy.
