Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and the Binnie Barnes star in "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 comedy based game. Olivier plays a young barrister, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to stay overnight in his hotel room when London's fog is too close to guests at the costume to go home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson) announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he will divorce her. Believing in the woman being Oberon, Olivier panic. Oberon, who is single and grandson of a judge, pretends she is that lady, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We've seen this plot or variations of it dozens of times. With this throw it is nice. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, the big team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly beautiful and does a good job of comedy when he portrays the tense, nervous barrister. Oberon gives his role the right light sensitivity. She looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdresser to her. She has some beautiful street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries with that hard hat, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is lovely as the real Lady More. <br /> <br /> The color of this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth a look.
