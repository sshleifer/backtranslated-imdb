I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five and so constant until I was seven. Then I got older and figured that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Plus, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who saw it faithfully with me for the two years, began to dislike thinking it too "nice". <br /> <br /> Then I realized every afternoon at five o'clock it was 11 o'clock and I became dependent on it again. Full house has made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how wonderful it would be if our world were like the world of Full House plus a mother. I've heard people say the Full House is cheesy and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters struggle and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can sometimes get into bickers. What is more real than that? <br /> <br /> Eventually, the show has lifted me up when I'm down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was in complete happiness. I hailed as a hyena on the show and got a massive obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken that place, but they were literally the cutest babies I've ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)
