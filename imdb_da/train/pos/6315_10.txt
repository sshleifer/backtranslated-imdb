Welcome to Collinwood are many things, but none of the following: <br /> <br /> A George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes I know, the basis of the movie is a another movie. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, it may be with their most authentic output this decade - and for me it does. <br /> <br /> The movie is from start to finish, an absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no poor performance in the movie. The fun parts are fun. The angular parts are angular. Scripture does not contain a dull moment of dialogue. The cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And that doesn't match the Hollywood norm (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember watching commercials for the movie. This movie went under the radar after not using much at the box office and is not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average filmmakers is because they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If movies are as original and fun as this one was pumped out as often as millions of pieces of s ** t, movie experience would be a much fresher place - <br /> <br /> When "they" say they are not doing as they used to, "they" did not welcome Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun mini-masterpiece of captain's comedy that refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
