Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overloaded at work, she can hire Paul to help her out. Paul is just out of jail and his past is not completely behind him. To say too much more about the story, which has many phrases, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she can't - a kind of "point of hear" (as point of view). The early scenes that set this up, as well as Carla and Paul's early character development, were more interesting to me than the twists later, some of which were difficult to follow and / or stretched the credibility a little. There is also an unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing but may not seek out. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
