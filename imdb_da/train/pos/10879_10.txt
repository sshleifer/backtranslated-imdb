I want to look cut since the day I heard about it, which was sometime last year. Anyway I got to see today and when the movie started I thought it started pretty week, but it got better after 10 minutes or so. I thought the movie was pretty good. but the thing I did not like was how the killer was created, I thought just before renting that it would probably suck like Urban legends: finally cutting, I almost died. mostly everything in the UL end was to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scene. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I cut a 8 out of 10
