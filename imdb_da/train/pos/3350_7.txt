I can't remember ever seeing this before tonight, probably the title sounded so common that it kept me by. But it is a well designed b Western, with an interesting embroidery story that is complimented by switching from good to grainy. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum slopes into a wide open city looking for his wife and news about their daughter, and remains a time as an actor. As usual, the good business people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the evils, but as the business they bring. It still applies: relax drink and spillover and encourage the industries, but pretend to regret the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating about this film is Mitchum's cynical intense depiction when it comes to cleaning the city of evil, and the city's peoples that his violent methods were the only ones. Favorite piece: The sudden death of 2 of the evil in the Red Dog saloon. Burning the main salon borders on unpleasant, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. Generally, a very good movie with the only flaw that tends to be a bit of courtesy - not so good for Do-Gooders, that would probably prefer a lifetime of evil negotiations rather than ending it.
