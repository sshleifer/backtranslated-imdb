Well, that was one of the movies I caught off-chance, and it was good enough to sign up when it appeared next time. If you, like me, enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branch out a bit from the norm (ie not just another genes of generic successors) then I think you can enjoy this. When the bad guy eventually comes up personally, he was definitely not what I expected to see! All in all, I wouldn't go out of this way, but if you like the genre, watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I think. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.
