"And everyone through the house" is a special creep episode, not just because it is from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember that a young man was on vacation with my parents that the summer of 1989 in our South Carolina hotel room on the HBO I saw this episode and I was buried to the crypt just as well and forever! I had always been a fan of the horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had terrible pleasure. This episode is the first thing I experienced is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so much fun with a good twist. "And everyone through the house" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to make you relax for holiday! Well, you still have Mary Ellen Trainor (who in addition plays in several warnerbrothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting for some money and a new romance. Only as most horror series does things take a trip to the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are heavily stacked when a madman dressed as Santa Claus escapes from a local nut house, making a late holiday carved on Christmas Eve! From the old E.C. comics, you learn that bad people get what they practice! Now this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! Also this story was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic cryptic episodes of all time!
