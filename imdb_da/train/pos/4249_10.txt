Whether it's three guys in their tighty-whiteys rapper to a guy tied in twin or a girl says "What up, dog?" to a lump of roadkill, that's something, all in Knuckleface Jones. It is strange and surreal and not quite an understandable yarn ... but it never loses you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed at me. And every night after I would come home and see it again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that cemented my crush at Piper Perabo. See it ... before it's too late!
