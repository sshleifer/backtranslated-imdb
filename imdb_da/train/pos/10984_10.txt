An immediate question is: Would this movie be made if the women in it were not aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? The answer is: Probably not. <Br /> <br /> But fortunately, they are (or were) cousin and aunt of Jackie. <br /> <br /> This documentary from the Maysles brothers about existence (one could hardly call it a life) by Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), has the same appeal of a train wreck - You won't see, but you should. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in an outstanding grand mansion in East Hampton, New York, slowly decaying around them. The unique beautiful gardens are now a jungle. Wonderful oil painting leans against the wall (with stools on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women settle on the walls next to covering old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living for many years has broken many barriers between the two women, but raised others. Clothes seem to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panties worn over them and pieces of cloth wrapped and attached around her torso and head. As Edith says "Edie is still beautiful at 56." And actually she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent, and both women show the beauty that was once there. <br /> <br /> There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. They are eating habits be polite) strange. Ice scattered on crackers. An evening party for Edith's birthday with Wonder Bread sandwiches is served on fine porcelain with plastic utensils. Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says "I have no watches." <br /> <br /> Their relationship with men is so black. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith has pursued some of her attempts at happiness. She says "If you can't get a man to suggest you, you might as well be dead." To which Edith answers, "I take a dog one day." It is obvious that Edith does not see his role in Edie's lack of crew companionship. Early in the film, she says, "France fell, but Edie did not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what you say. Both women are talking simultaneously and constantly contradicting each other. /> There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film, Edie feeds raccoons in the ceiling with Wonderbread and cat food. The cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At some point, Edie declares "Aristocrat Characteristics are responsibility. "But they seem unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to see, but it's worth doing.
