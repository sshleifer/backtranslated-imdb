That part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey, and I was extremely impressed with his performance. I wasn't worried about being a big fan of him, but pleasantly surprised with the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the sweetest little girl I've seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even drawn to tears at some point! I never read Dr. Seus's book of the story, so I didn't know what to expect, humor was quite dark. Overall, I enjoyed the movie (apart from the songs!) And would recommend it for family viewing especially.
