Ride with the devil directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another gem in this fine director cap. For those who are not familiar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border war during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. Besides some amazing action scenes (pretty bloody at times). This is a story of love and affection between men and especially a lady. The stars, Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and as the youth jewel, I've never heard or seen her before, I want to see more of her). The play is top notch, amazing production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) <br /> <br /> This is a long movie 128 minutes but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> submitted respectively <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
