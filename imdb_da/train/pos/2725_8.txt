"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks of Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and pointless murder of a family of four of a couple of rude criminals. The film is distinguished as a character study by the killings, especially the trigger Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast contains few recognizable names, yet they bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with different personalities. They play effortlessly with each other, while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the casting is only average and is not worth noting. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the manuscript was miscalculated with some incorrect narratives in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated filmography of Conrad Hall is also top-notch, like editing. It is also worth noting is the jazzy score of Quincy Jones who secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike so many other crime movies, you don't glamorize violence. Brooks makes the killers scary rather than condemning them. Whether you agree with that mood, the movie provides an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the movie for this reason and also the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.
