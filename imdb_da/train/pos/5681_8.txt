I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was pretty good. It is the actual LAPD crime film that disturbed me. I wonder if Lion's Gate really believed that the general public would see people brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. Sorry Lion's Gate, this was an incredibly bad idea !!! <br /> <br /> Come back to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sleaze, mistreating the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as her boyfriend), and he is hopelessly deep into drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous Wonderland murders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? We can never know the whole truth for the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the film does a good job anyway.
