Recently, I was looking for the newly released Wide Screen DVD by FLY AWAY HOME and came up with an interesting title that I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough Film, got my attention (he is responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the manuscript was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I chanced it and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan stars like Archie Gray Owl, a real staircase in the 1930s that came to love and respect the wild countries of Canada and worked to protect them. Brosnan (who played in a James Bond movie) provides a shady, warm and powerful performance like Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feelings for the beings in the country - especially the trepidation. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and the beautiful photograph of Roger Pratt attaches great importance to the film's effectiveness. AND extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the genuine Gray Owl as well as sound comments from Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not loaded with much violence and sex. This is a movie that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of the film - and a whole new love and understanding for the beavers! GRAY OWL is a very nice movie - worth checking out! This is one I am looking forward to sharing with others.
