If it is action and adventure you want in a movie, then it is best to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood, check out "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts a convincing performance as the gentle and gentleman Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a three-state riding clipper to see his brother-in-law who has had strokes. Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road, making friends of strangers and educating many grandfatherly family counseling along the way. The story moves as slowly as the rider, but somehow manages to keep the viewer awake and waits for the next life lesson of Alvin's offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. It is the only way to see this very good movie that rates 7/10 in my book.
