Musically, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect musical after Top Hat, if possible. Although in this case Jerome Kern confectionary Roberta, they were inside, flew Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who joined Navy to forget Ginger Rogers's former partner. But now the two are on land leave. Fred and Ginger pick up just where they left off, and Randy unfortunately encounters Ginger's dowdy sister Harriet, who blooms in a real beauty. But Randy is a typical love and leaves them a sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin wrote a hit score with him who was close to monitoring production. Ginger gets to make some really excellent vocalizing with Lad Yourself Go as she and Fred later dance to. But the real hit on the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, which is a number performed on a marine show. Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic songs ever written for the screen. Their dance on this is absolute magic. I'm sure when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who it was. But they will know immediately when I mention her in connection with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. It's really Ozzie and Harriet. It's something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky's mother on television. Then she didn't even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really hold a tune. She sings get you behind me Satan and the Moon, and I'm here, but where are you, both with true feeling and class. I recommend you see the Follow Fleet if it is nothing but hearing a dimension of Harriet Hilliard that is incredibly forgotten today.
