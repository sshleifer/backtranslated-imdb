If you like plot twists, this is your movie. It is impossible at all times to predict what will happen next time. Nothing is as it looks or ends as you think it will. The characters are all calm and engaging. Cage is at her best. Dennis Hopper again shows his lovely scary side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a movie debut excellent in a cameo. I categorize this movie as "I have a real, really, really bad day" movie. Not a slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper. This movie is underestimated and unfortunately overlooked.
