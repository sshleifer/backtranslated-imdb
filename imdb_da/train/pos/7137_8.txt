The reason for the good-natured MR TOM on paper seems to be that we are in a big dose of maudlin, sick sentiment. But talented instructor Jack Gold is an expert in touching the emotions in the right way, and it appears to be a compelling, in-depth war drama with excellent production and lead performance.One of the best, if not the best television films of the 1990s, which might have been even more successful if it had been released in the theaters. <br /> <br /> Of course, evacuation of children to landscape towns and villages in World War II was a common practice, but in the case of the young boy, here was twice as important because of a miserable home life in Britain's capital. The war graves on the home front are not driven over, and the construction of the film until it is stuttering, foggy eyes, joins us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before. It is almost (but not entirely) worth comparing with the finals until it is a wonderful life (1946). All in all a modern classic.
