Prince stars as "Kid" in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musical who has a smaller then star life. It is true that the action leaves a little to be desired (excludes Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both of which are pitch perfect), but the film is still great and among the best that comes out of the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of any movie in the last 50 years, at least, high quotable lines, and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is simply STUNNING. On a non-related not when I saw the prince in concert in 2004, he blew down at the stadium. He is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts I have experienced. <br /> <br /> My character: A <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Disc 1) Comment with Director Albert Magnoli Producer Robert Cavallo, Photographer Photographer Donald Thorin; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers to "Under Cherry Moon" and "Graffiti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12 minute featurette at First Avenue Club; "Little Rain: Bachstage Pass (half an hour featurette on the movie, which I will review later on the page);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minute featurette; 30 minutes of MTV's Premiere Footage (when MTV didn't suck donkey balls); 5 Prince music videos (Let's go wrong, take me with you when pigeons cry, would I die 4 u / baby I am a star and purple rain); 2 videos of The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a music video for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6.
