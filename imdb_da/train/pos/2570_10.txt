Well, that's probably one of the best movies I've seen, and I love it so much that I've remembered most of the script (especially the scene in the store when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even with the script in my head I can still see it to Jerry Lee, the German shepherd is hysterical and is really tested to see who is smarter. The roof line also applies. Not to mention the play is amazing, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (See CSI filmography if you don't know what I mean). It is too bad that this movie only contained the only problem Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work on, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks Zeus and Welles had on their sleeves.
