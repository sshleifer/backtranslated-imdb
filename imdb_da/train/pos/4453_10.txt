I really think I should do my case and have every (scary and or cool) movie buffet go see this movie ... I did! <br /> <br /> It's Excellent: Very atmospheric and disturbing and scary. <br /> <br /> Inaccessible how to make such a gem of a movie with the very low (read "no"!) budget they had .... <br /> <br /> Synopsis taken from the website: "One morning, an old man walks out into the woods looking for his rat treasure. Instead, he finds a child without parents and a murder without corpse ..." <br /> <br /> On this website (IMDb) there is no trailer, but I will leave a link here to the film itself, where there is a trailer that is quite disturbing, so please go check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
