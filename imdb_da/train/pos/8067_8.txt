Today, if anyone mentions the name Victor McLaglen, the answer is likely to be "Who?" or maybe "why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in this movie, which is about a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend to "carfare" to the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland, and while all the other characters either directly or indirectly fight for the political independence of Ireland, all McLaglen's character is concerned about getting money and getting drunk. The film makes one wonder if political activism is worth all the problems, because while the activist is struggling to make a point, not many are very interested, they do not even know what the uprising is about. The moral of this movie is: Look out for the friend, he can sell you off for a crown.
