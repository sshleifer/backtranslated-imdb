** SPOILERS ** Since the son of his favorite niece Phyllis murder mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, Ruth Gordon, has strong suspicions that it was Phyllis' husband Edmund Galvin, Charles Frank, who was responsible for her death. In fact, Abigail is convinced that he has murdered her and made it a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Knowing that there are no indications that Edmund was arrested for Phyilli's death and deciding to take the law into his own hands Abigail boils up this elaborate plan to make him look and make it look like , like Phylli's death, a tragic accident. Making Edmund secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination for her walk-in safe when she is leaving on vacation to New York City, Abigail needs him to step in to unlock the surprise and surprise Edmund in. With the security of being soundproofed, no one in the manor butler girl and Abigail's personal secretary Veronica, Mariette Hartley, hears him screaming for help, and the next day Edmund is found suffocated to death. Veronica discovered Edmund's body as she was setting aside to ensure Abigail's latest murder mystery manuscript. <br /> <br /> Lt. Columbo, Peter Falk, is called the case of Edmund Garvin's strange death to determine whether it is a murder or a tragic accident. Going through Edmunds apartment Columbo is amazed to find out that he does not have a single picture of his late wife who has been missing for just a month! This binds to what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund, not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspect in her, in Abigail's mind, to murder. <br /> <br /> Columbo, a great fan with his wife, of Abigail's murder mystery novels has difficulty realizing that she was actually responsible for Edmund's death. All evidence points to Abigil, including a few missing car keys that were Edmunds. It all showed that Abgail was actually in the house, not heading to the airport when Edmund was locked in the walk-in safe. <br /> <br /> Going through all the evidence Columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence inside the security in writing to whom his killer is. This conclusion is quickly checkmated when it is discovered that Edmund did not even have a pen or pencil and light with the printed light bulb burned out on him to write it. There is also something very strange about security that has been on Lt. Columbo mind ever since he came on the case. This has to do with the black paint residue found under the dead Edmunds nails and on his belt buckle! <br /> <br /> It is the evidence, along with a number of other things in the safe, that eventually hangs Edmund's murder on the cheated and very cunning mystery writer Abigail Mitchell. Edmund let Abigail unknowingly judge himself in his last attempt when the air in safety was used up by breathing by using burnt-out matchsticks to write on Abigail's last manuscript that killed him: Abigail Mitchell!
