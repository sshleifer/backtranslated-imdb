That's what one of the girls finally said. <br /> <br /> Is the football match a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls (or more broadly, a free-thinking group) and the authority? "To Germany" means for a future that is of hope? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable movie experiences I've ever had - despite the raw movie and plot and the mildly over-the-top (though I like the cast - they are lovable and well above expectations amateurs). The ridiculous situation is successful. I can feel that the deep frustration is being denied a game (being female and a football fan) and I can't stop thinking about how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section where protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided - defeating the weak reasons for refusing. <br /> <br /> The movie is very cleverly made - the amazing title, the movie during the game itself, the spontaneity and various methods of putting the viewers into the shoe's character - the game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown) , the lurking light and the happy sound of the stadium, the confinement of the van and the useless of it when they connect with the celebrating crowds outside. I can feel the comfort that comes from the radio, drinks and food, and of course the kindness and consideration of each character to others. During the final credit I am amused that no character has a name - he is just a "soldier" and she is just a "girl" or "sister".
