As far as I know, this show was never repeated on British television after its original maturity at the end of the 60s / early 70s, and unfortunately most episodes are now "missing presumed wiped out". However, Series 6 from 1971 still exists in its entirety, and I recently got the chance to see it all, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After rushing home from school, freewheelers were crucial to me and many of my contemporaries left in the halcyon days of flared pants, Slade and Chicory Tip. And look at it again brought a nostalgic lump to the neck. <br /> <br /> Never mind the bad / hammy acting, the unintentional fun fighting scenes, plot holes wide enough to pilot a great ocean-going yacht and "scary, scary" RADA accents from the main players. <br /> <br /> Forget it all. Because Freewheelers are leaning back to a bygone (dare I say "golden") age of children's television drama, when the performance was simply rip-roaring fun and not so serious. Before being obsessed with all the anxiety-laden "ishoos" that today's writers have their young protagonists cattle, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STIs, etc. Without a doubt it was "remade for a modern audience" these days with all-pervasive political correctness, the chief figure would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be Muslim, the other would be a white boy confused about his sexuality, and the girl would be an all-action go-getter with an IQ Out of the scale that would forever get the killer out of the scraper and make them look silly - in other words, a million miles removed from Wendy Padbury's secluded, ankle-spreading disc height upper. <br /> <br /> It's a show that's very "of its time". But is that a bad thing? I don't think so for one.
