This movie is the coolest movie on metal there. Premise: A child gets hold of the final recording of his favorite artist Sammy Curr, who recently dies in a hotel fire. He plays it backwards and summons him back from the dead to avenge himself in the name of the heavy metal on the wicked jocks that plague him. Any fan of real metal will enjoy this movie, and if you are a metal head bothered by jocks, play a Sammy Curr album backwards ......... no wait, he is fictitious, grab hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air, head bang and volume of 11!
