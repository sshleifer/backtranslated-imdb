The jokes are obvious, the gags are corny, and the characters go characatures - but I couldn't stop laughing at his very entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of this, and I highly recommend it to all lovers of thoughtless entertainment. It contains many quotes moments and some of the best synagogues I've seen this day. If you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle, hire this one on the way home Friday night to get your weekend off to a good start.
