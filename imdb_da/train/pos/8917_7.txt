A meteorite falls into the land in a small town that brings a jelly creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats the blister carefully and asks Steve to investigate the spot where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and residents, but no one believes in them, while the blob engages many people, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cool and classic sci-fi. It's a low budget movie, with many ham actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), horrible effects, but also lovely and very, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I had seen 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon) and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and sci-fi B-movies from the 50s. The movie problem in my review number 1,400 couldn't be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
