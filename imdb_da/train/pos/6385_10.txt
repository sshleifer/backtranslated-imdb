This movie was amazing! It was an excellent reproduction of an old myth. The animation was somewhat strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was another level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little shabby, but it was more than made up for the beauty and lushness of the countryside. The music was mostly instrumental, but it was perfect for the movie. This was certainly not a movie that needed the characters to break into the song. Perfect. 10 out of 10
