Excellent view of a mature woman who will lose everything (even pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved in this particular "business", innocence, and true love that exists between a small town's people is blended perfectly to give us a fresh, light and fun comedy. I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European movies, and with movies like this my mind grows stronger. A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed, in the same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends have had as much as myself. You will love it.
