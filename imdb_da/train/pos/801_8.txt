I suppose JEDI is now chronologically regarded as the very "last" entry in the popular saga, and it is a very good one that was several of these. I liked how direct this sequel went after EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated Luke Skywalker's maturity as a sign (and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about Ewoks, they weren't that bad. I enjoyed the exciting hunting in the woods, and I felt there were a lot of charitable feelings with this chapter. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully weighs all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy subject. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made in the original movies, but being a relative beginner to these movies quite late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think that he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole unit. Oh, and wrong - Carrie Fisher looked pretty delicious in her skimpy outfit.
