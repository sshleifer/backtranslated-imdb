Buck's work, which spent years in China as a missionary parent who gave her deep insight into Chinese culture and its philosophy, this film adaptation has been superbly done both in the field of technical art and action. /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: surviving out of his country and being recently turned to Olan, a servant of a rich and strong family in the village area. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to breed the country, raise children and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to eradicate everything they have worked for. Choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian faith, instead travels to a major city to wait for famine.

She is summed up rounded to the execution of the army, but is rescued at the last minute. Her happiness, however, is that she found valuable jewels at the plumbing that allow her and her family to return to their farm to start again. The recently found fortune transforms Wang Lung.
