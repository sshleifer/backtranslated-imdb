The photography of this bid budget production is surprisingly poor. The colors are muddy and brown and the photography has a lot to look at. Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and also television films. * And * at the beginning, the film only seems to torture its viewers with shabby images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also a typical simple and boring work of this overvalued, unlikely composer. <br /> <br /> But if you are willing to watch the film further, you are rewarded with a very moving family history, a kind of European version of Edna Ferber's family epic Giant. While first wondering why Clara married this idiotic man, his character becomes more deep and more background one can judge him. Clara delivers the film's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose girlfriend is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands this lesson and ultimately tries to live by it. The way the plot was built with the end mirrors beginning was great. The actors also do a good job. I wondered "Who is the actor playing Blanca?" all the time, but of course it was a really young Winona Ryder! All in all, this movie really made me want to read the book.
