Just one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capotey's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white filmography (which should have won an Oscar), a haunting quincy jones score and amazing performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly matched killers. This film was 0 to 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go figure! <br /> <br /> Even if you don't teach the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-relieving process of tracking down these guys. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no errors in this. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended!
