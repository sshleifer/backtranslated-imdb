Although it's not as scary as it's cool classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I actually like this better. This is because of the faster pace, better settings and the cool 80's soundtrack. It is packed with action and has the sweetest effects of Lucio Fulci. The zombies do not look as unpleasant as in ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It was done pretty well, but it certainly has its share of cheesiness; For example, some zombies move slowly, while others are as fast as ninjas. Some are braindead, while others say fun lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There is even a flying zombie head! Where's that line? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. It would probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. Also check out Zombi 4.
