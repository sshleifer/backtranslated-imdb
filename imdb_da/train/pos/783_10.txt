The first word that comes into my mind after seeing this movie is "beauty". Beauty is around in the actors' plays (Andie is amazing as always), in well-designed shots and in the author's red line - Love. I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in these three women's otherwise boring and predictable lives. His interaction makes the Andie's character live as entertaining as it could be. When he is gone, it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and adhere to our inner faith and sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully turns away from this loss is not a bad thing, instead it turns out that life prevails in some form, even in this little British village, which is perfectly seen. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in every way - everything there houses and "fags" and accents :))). And Andie is doing great jobs again! It's a shame that this movie got such low marks. 10 out of ten!
