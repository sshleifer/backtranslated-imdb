"Can contain spoilers" <br /> <br /> "All dogs go to heaven" is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old, I didn't understand it so well, but as I saw it more and several times I started to love it, I love the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are "Let me be surprised" and "Soon You'll Come Home". It's beautiful songs. The only thing that worries me about the movie is Charlie Dieing. When I was little, my sister couldn't even see that part. Except that this movie is wonderful. My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around the sky. The sky is beautiful in the movie, and the "bells" are very clever. I also love Itchy, in fact I have 3 digs. They are so sweet. I love this movie and suggest everyone to watch it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
