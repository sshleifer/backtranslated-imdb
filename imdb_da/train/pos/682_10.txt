This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and although it may be too slow for some, it's worth seeing. A company lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is drawn into a case involving "city" aborigines, and that is not commonplace. OK, a man is dead, but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. There has also been a more than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic and repressive. The Aborigines have a secret and refuse to waste the prayers. This has a lot to do with white men who make assumptions about "City" vs "Tribal" Aborigines, and of course no Abo in the big city will practice tribal ways. Uh huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams, and he is somehow the key to what happens, even though it is not so much how many times I've seen this, I can't quite understand the exact connection. This is a very scary and eerie movie, and is a fine example of Peter Weir's ability to excite in nothing. The end is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it's the easiest way out and the most embarrassing. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
