Ten% s and As *, lots of boobies. Some great characters, fun filled pranks and well-put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise. It feels like really OLD SCHOOL. It feels a bit like Porky's for the 2000s. Some great fun characters combined with some very humorous situations make this a real surprise to me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is all but one, I found this movie really entertaining. Let's not get too excited, you have to take it to booby teen comedy, it's, but for what it excels. The characters are fun and funny, the girls are warmer than hell. Fun and games are fun, with some things I've never seen before in comedies, they make me scratch, but laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> Then ignore the hats and give it a run and see what you're thinking. Don't expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so.
