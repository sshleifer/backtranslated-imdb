This is an excellent but hard to find trippy World War I spy thriller in the endless 60's Italian style. From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the fantastic score of Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic neighbors' land fight scenes with poison gas and German cavalry in full gas-protected storm storm gear, this is a movie that must not be missed . It is a movie that captures the atrocities and cruelty of war and the recklessness of the players on and off the battlefield. Apart from the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this movie was saved to the battle scenes, but for lovers of the 60th cinema it should not be a problem. I first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to lose it on VHS. I still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
