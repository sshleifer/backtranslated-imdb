A recent view of THAT's ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to see many of the classic MGM musicals from the eighties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely a smaller movie than on the city. The songs are not so good, nor chemistry between the characters. But the film blends beautifully classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the forest above it and then running down the stairs while dozens of pianists playing the piano, is the best scene in the movie, although the scene where Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists play. Sinatra crowner then: "I am too loving too easy" before he has his epiphany about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and pollution-free air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone in the mid-1940s?!), And the piano music is absolutely brilliant. MGM had certainly a flair to create lyrical moments like these.
