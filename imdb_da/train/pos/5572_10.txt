This movie was hysterical. I haven't been laughing hard for a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting," but should it be? I actually went into the advanced screening that expects much less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is quite constant. Amanda Peet is warm and wonderful. The whole audience I screened with seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did.
