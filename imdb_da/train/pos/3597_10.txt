(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie. I rented a little movielink and decided to check out this movie. A lot of boxing movies seem to overflow the blood. In this movie, it shows it at the amateur level. Although I wish, it might have been more attentive that she might have improved her grades. The film points to the problems that some families face with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the ending. But the end was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think it was pretty clear from the title that she would win. It was unexpected that the two came together again at the end. <br /> <br /> Loved the point for some of the scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Replayable: 10/10
