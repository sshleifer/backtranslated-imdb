We always watch American movies with their special accents from each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. All foreign people should look at this movie and have an open mind to accept another culture, besides American and European dominating the dominant film industry. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about a parallel world that it is not even considered for those living in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confused world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share their world. It is a really good movie and worst a rent even has it at home.
