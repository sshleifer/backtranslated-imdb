My daughter, her friends and I have seen this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it. Subsequently, I rented it so many times. It just never gets old !!! Blockbuster doesn't even have it in their listings anymore, and I've been trying to buy, find, rent it for over 5 years. Without a doubt this was and is my most favorite movie of my daughter's childhood ... it has it all! We laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and how hard some children have in the world. There was nothing like this movie. We related to every second and every line Bill! Thanks a million to restore our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who should we judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his own. It can't be my or your life. It is not only credible, it happens every day. Thank God! Keeping my faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate!!!!
