I was really stunned by how much a movie over the age of 60 could impress me. It is almost two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in what is subtitles, but it is nevertheless interesting and exciting to see. What impressed me most was the film's realism. You could almost feel the ice cold because you could see that storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world like our days. I wondered how much work this might have been for van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore? It's a great movie with a good message, and I would recommend it to future directors to see how big and realistic movies can be if they are only aimed at realism rather than visual effects.
