As I watched this movie, and I began to see its signs evolve, I could feel this would be an excellent picture. When you get that feeling and the movie actually meets these expectations, the experience is rare. I had the right feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played rivets and incredibly strong parts, both of which were worthy of Oscar. The support was equally strong and created a winning foundation for the image to grow on. I can say without hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.
