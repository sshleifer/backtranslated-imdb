My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I couldn't find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the United States in February 1955. I watched it at a "first round" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. Wonder if it was reissued or a problem? In my opinion, this movie is very easy entertainment but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan does almost the same role he did in Red River years earlier. And in my opinion, James Stewart gives as good a performance as he ever did. I've seen this movie half a dozen times or more, and never tired of seeing parts of it again. Photography and nature are amazing, and it provides a remarkable amount of entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
