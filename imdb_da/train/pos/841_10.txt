I found this to be a deeply entertaining dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; As someone will now witness, he must not be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was so charismatic and as fun as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I've been laughing hard under any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be 'I want a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the naval left'. Brosnan delivered this very unconnected line with such unexpected comic finesse. I was also very impressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems that everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such an extent that it actually improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will certainly like this. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
