I thought Sentinel should be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The movie is not good, but it is very fun, and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of TV series as 24 or alias. It looks a lot like that series and it also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller. In the fire. If you are going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you will enjoy The Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
