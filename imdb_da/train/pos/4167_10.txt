The Devil's Dog: Hound of Hell is really good movie. It has good plays by the player, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is scary and gives the devilish chill! I liked the effects on the dog, and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns, frill like a part on the neck and seemed really viscous! If you like horror movies and haven't seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and can find and buy this rare movie then do it because it's a good movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed!
