The National Gallery of Art showed the long thought, the original effortless version of this movie on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes cut by censors at release. The Shoemaker's character, a morally good-good person in the original censored release of 1933, is presented here as a supporter of the philosopher Nietsze and encourages her to use men to climb to the top. Also, the corny end of the original, which I assume is in current VHS versions is eliminated and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Hopefully this movie will be re-released on DVD for everyone to appreciate their great qualities. Look for it.
