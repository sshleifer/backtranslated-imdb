If you are not in the mood for more than an hour of movie than this movie can give you some variation. What I love is the ongoing surprises. It's not just once that you want one or more of the short film in 'New York I Love You' to continue. Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some of them very short, some of them longer, some of them have the final ends, some of them don't. <br /> <br /> Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationality backgrounds. Many of it makes it feel the same way I once went to a capital in other countries for a year, where many people come from different countries. This movie explores many types of things you may have known, but for all characters it is a new thing. Maybe some of you have traveled alone abroad to be a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; Feeling dreamy, sad, but the kind of sad you are looking for because it's just bored you were in your own home. You might relive it again by seeing this.
