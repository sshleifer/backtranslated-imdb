After the first shock to realize Mr Branagh's gut to film this, I literally shook the excitement of having this epic right in front of me. I was not disappointed. So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy watching, or listening to, Branagh and it made me wonder ... is this movie dubbed in other countries? It would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
