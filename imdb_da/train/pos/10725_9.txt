Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The reason is predictable, but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent at the moment. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released at the time of the pendulum disaster, and it really is an inhibitor of how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene where the swing doors open in the room is simply spectacular ... on the big screen it's ... on a TV ... it just seems to be average. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were really up there. <br /> <br /> Looking at IMAX would be a good movie, but I'm sure it will never happen.
