I've seen many movies, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in a class of its own. It excels in every department. The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay close attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name of the selection. Blake and Wilson turn into star performances of the killer duo. The fact that many of the films are recorded in the actual places where the crime took place, even within the house itself, adds further chills. The black and white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent. There are many fantastic film works out there, but if I could only vote for one to the top of the list, it would most likely be "in cold blood".
