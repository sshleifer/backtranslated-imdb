If the Australian Post Office ever needs a recruitment advertising profile, it is. This is one of the movies whose heart is in the right place and you can see again and again. Miranda's performance touches, as it shows an aspect of Australia that is despised by many Europeans, because it can be cold, wet and gloomy, just like elsewhere and just as important is the people who surround you. The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career moving into a 'dead letter office' a thought to be considered. Miranda has gone on to make bigger movies, but I hope she always holds a thought for this one?
