I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's a great movie. A very disturbing thing in it. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is very similar to "The Blair Witch Project". It's shot complete with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 children. Just your average kids. Others and Calvin. They start a campaign against the High School title "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in Video Diary form, from the 2 children. It shows relationships with parents who, among other things, show that these are just normal children, just like people we know or have hit in. We find out that the army of 2's last mission will give right to zero day. They plan to shoot up there in high school. <br /> <br /> You see how to access there guns, how they plan it, everything. They emphasize that the media have not affected them at all and there is no need to do so. As I said, this all said in the Video Diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safe that is seen after Zero Day. The actual recording is displayed via Survillence cameras throughout the school. Chilling indeed. The film is very chilling. Some of the things they say how they plan it, just watch it yourself. A quote that I remember is the only time Calvin knows. He says, "Others think it just goes in an escape truck, make it to many schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I get out of school is in a black plastic bag." <br /> <br /> I'm probaly, not even giving you the right idea about this movie. You really have to see it yourself. It is about festivals right now. <br /> <br /> A +.
