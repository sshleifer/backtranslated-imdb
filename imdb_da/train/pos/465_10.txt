Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the author's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider his best performance (I'm usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Worth to see.
