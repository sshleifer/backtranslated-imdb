This is a fantastic movie from the missing age of reactionary television drama. My all-time favorite actor, Robert Culp skillfully discovers a groundbreaking dense liberal justice and belief in the system, knee conservative and fear of crime and mistreated psychosis. The teenagers are a collection of pure insidious evil stereotypes, and the final message of this movie makes episodes of the dragon look consistent in comparison. But what really shines in this is the movie's great pace that builds the fear and paranoia gradually as well as the feel of the whole of California's setting. The cars are also good as I remember. I give this movie a 10 and I defy anyone watching this movie and not enjoying every minute. Remember, just because it's done on television doesn't mean it's not good art.
