A very fun east-facing west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, the Michigan factory in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the United States. Seen in Western Pennsylvania, it has amazing performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
