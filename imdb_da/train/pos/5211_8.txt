Since their eerie divorce from Disney Company (with the Disney holding Miramax brand), Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above-average film, which is then under-promoted and seen by few. FLOCKEN is a good example. <br /> <br /> A story about the officials who have the unpleasant work of watching registered sex offenders will tell you more about sex criminals than a whole season of law and order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives his best performance as the soft speaker is worn out of the job. Claire Danes once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of being scraped she usually gets stuck in) and she makes the best of playing the beginner. Cinematography, pacing, editing, everything is the first time --- and I saw no trace of the attention deficit camera jumping around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it is still a hard topic and can make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was hardly any problem with the types of sex crime shown in abundance, which will shock themselves. Then came the Supreme Court's rulings, which at the same time tied police hands as "rights" for sex perverts, and America was transformed into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversion, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was greeted with praise by the Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's dead acts with blank covers on Time and Newsweek. Daily liberals also praised the actions of the Court and mocked those who did not agree. In 2007, how many Americans know that the kind of pornography depicting violent violence and torture of young women can subscribe to, and the delivery of it is subsidized by the US Post Office's discount period rate. Just part of the problem - a problem that can endure everyone's family tearing. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a Liberal, but he does his best in his performance here. Perhaps in his mature age he has gained some wisdom.
