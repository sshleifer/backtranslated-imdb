I really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes evolved between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando goes from contempt for the Japanese (who is natural in view of WW2) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and wants to marry her. His performance is okay (I'm not a big fan of his acting style), and the movie is amazing all the way through. Red buttons received an Oscar for his touching performance of another GI falling in love with Japan (though the Japanese women who play opposite him also did a remarkable job). <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time. A most underrated gem.
