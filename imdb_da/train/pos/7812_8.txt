A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before their normal time. However, the old film does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and his teaching are reduced to a little, at best, a few witty remarks. The film is from 1987, the goal was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. Thus, the film aims to show how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987. To show this, the film must ignore Biko's death and thus not center his discourse on Biko, but on a white liberal journalist and his escape from the absurd system in which he lives. His escape is necessary because of the victim he is the victim of with his family and because he will publish the first book on Biko after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa while apartheid still stands and kills. So don't expect this way to be realistic and true. It couldn't be. But the movie is immensely aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical removal, the much removal that has taken place during Nelson Mandela's presidency, and it is called forgiveness, provided those who will be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional, but the very historic boundary makes it weaker today, especially since the film does not mention the third race community, the Indians. Panegyric books or movies all have the defect: they look at the person they are supposed to portray from one point of view. It explains why the movie has grown so much, seems to come from so long ago, as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is needed. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
