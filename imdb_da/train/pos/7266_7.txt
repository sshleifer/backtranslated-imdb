I remember having a pretty little consideration for a venture like this, when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy kid actress and a cheesy title in a John Hughes formula. You couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I was caught watching it while I was away on a Sunday afternoon, and it hit me on a few levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, part reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance by Kelly Lynch, escapism. All in all, it gently pulls some very nice cords. It's pretty hard not to fall into the story, develop a hug on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, not like the stiff evil guy girlfriend and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. Have all the ups and downs, with a good ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
