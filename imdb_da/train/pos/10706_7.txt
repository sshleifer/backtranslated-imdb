This is a good example of a movie that, despite the low rating, is more than worth seeing. The story is engaging and it doesn't take long before chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin tackles your attention. The play is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's portrayal of the law compliant and shy Englishman with porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom create lots of moments for laughs! Like the look of Nicole Kidman's eyes when she offers John his first taste of intimacy for a long time ... Other times, actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a professionally dramatic slope.
