More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical extracted biopic. This fun and amazing movie has the look of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you want in an indie-type movie. I think the trend is to portray Bettie Page as a kind of sex vixen, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked carefully at Betty's outlook, she always looked happy. Not a "you wish you could bring with me" haughty look, not even "I just do this because my acting career didn't work" look at a porn star. And then, the ladies involved in this movie (three female producers, a female writer / instructor, female co-author, and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I definitely helped shape this role with her own sugar influence) really caught the idea about a cute, slightly naive, southern girl who really enjoyed having her picture taken and hoped that good ol 'JC would not be too sorry for her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol shows high performance career (she can just have the most perfect breasts ever), which I love because she had the curse. Several years ago she made the cover of the Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was, forcing her as the next IT girl. And let's be honest, it was a little presumable. Unfortunately, I think she has never done so for Gwyneth status but not for lack of talent. Making a couple of bad movie choices when you are a beautiful blonde in incredible Hollywood makes you feel like I'm scared. If this does not put her back on the A list, then I am a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Very private, Bettie herself hasn't seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pinup attached to a high note and fell in love with his old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat floats honey. You were a helluva woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Mary Harron, you've made our cool idol justice.
