A great movie with - for his time - an intense, bubbly, rather dark story reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers" but not so brutal. The story starts quickly and does not give up, with several scenes of really good dialogue between (Stewart's) Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is in some ways reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann-Stewart work, but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting. There are a few reservations: an overly wrapped (and rather sentimental) end; The 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course the film takes place in Mythic West, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, detached man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't beat. A fine western costume drama.
