Chuck Jones' Hare Conditioned is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skined apartment store manager who wants him filled, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of his multi-purpose setting. Chase takes Bugs and his pursuits through a number of departments, leading to an inspired gag, where they quickly arrive from different departments, with which clothes are associated with that part of the store. This big gag is trumped, though by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators where Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager to relentlessly get to and from the elevators at the wrong time. It is a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives room for a not much fun final gag. At that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has got its mark as one of the big chasie films that burst with wild energy. As Bugs became more refined in some of the other cartoons of this period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that he could still be as appealing as a more anarchic character.
