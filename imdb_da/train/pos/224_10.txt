Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite emotions good movies. I saw it first as it was like Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up watching it 6 times in the theaters, and if it played today, I would go out to see it again. <br /> <br /> Now, many reviews have mentioned the amazing achievements of the leaders. Matthau was brilliant, but had the accident been nominated for Jack Nicholson's Oscar-winning performance by Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Burns won, although Richard Benjiman deserved at least also to be nominated. Roles were played for perfection, like Fritz Feld auditioning for the commercial potato chips. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this movie, the direction of the heavily underrated Herbert Ross, Ross, who previously took a two person Plays "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and made a full movie out of it. Do it again. He opens the plays without making them look like a photographic scene game. He flips out the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes into the movie before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark is going to see his uncle and tell him about the special comedy. twenty minutes, The sequence itself is brand new. A few years ago, I watched the Broadway revival of the game with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, who were wonderful. But I think Ross and scriptwriter, dramatist Simon improved on it. It's just a wonderful movie.
