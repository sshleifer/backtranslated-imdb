I like the good and evil kind. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. He was not the clever, cuddle, knowing everything he usually plays. He shows heart and a more humble humor. The fact that it shows that there are foreign things in heaven and on earth than we can think of, gives me hope.
