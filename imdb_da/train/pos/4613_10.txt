This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I've seen. For me, this is what makes it so great! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully together "comic." I want Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, to have had more plot involvement. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but it was mostly wasted in this movie. This movie stars also the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think some better work could have come out of it.
