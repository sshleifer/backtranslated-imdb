A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to rescue his boss from the electric chair by tracking a mysterious "phantom" woman and Franchot Tone as a mad and murderous sculptor. There are also some fascinating minor parts played by Elisha Cook Jr. as a killed trap drummer, as well as the other characters that make up part of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in more healthy parts, she'll be allowed to go overboard here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays quite another, and although it is not a convincing part, he seems phenomenal. While the conspiracy is too constructed, the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting.
