All good movies "inspire" some directly into video copycat flick. I was afraid that "gladiator" was not really such a good movie, because I hadn't seen any movies that had something like some Roman on the new release shelf for months. Then I saw the full moon's newest sacrifice, Demonicus. I am a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls, but had never seen one of their non-killing doll games. Anyway ... Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a body and try it. He becomes obsessed, and like the demonic gladiator Tyrannus, it is urgent to kill his friends to revive the body, who is the real Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Supported, like many Full Moon movies, this has little or no budget. At times, editing and direction were so amusing that I would swear that I was looking at the Blair Witch Project. The attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python shit. Weapons, although apparently right, really look plastic-y. It looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital video camera on a weekend. Granted, there is nothing wrong with such filmmaking, just don't rent it, expecting a technical masterpiece. It seems that there were also attempts at research for the manuscript, because even though Tyrannus doesn't really work much like a gladiator until the end, he speaks at least Latin. All trashing away, I actually enjoyed this movie. Not as much as a killer doll rope, maybe, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was there was no Full Moon Video Zone at the end!
