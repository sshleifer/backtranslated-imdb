A remarkable documentary about the Kumba Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) landmark performance, in southwest Cameroon, with legal protection of women's and children's rights from acts of violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to the Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of introducing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of inaction, the WLA leaders recently began to score a few victories and the purpose of this movie is to share these victorious stories. Leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge. Both play themselves in this movie, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, although I imagine much of it, if not all, of subsequent recreation of real events to the camera. Four cases have been reviewed and all applicants also play themselves in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases involving repeated wife strikes, with coercion in one case; the other involves forced sex on a 10 year old girl; and yet another relates to repetitive veil of a child, 8, of an aunt. One of the beaten wives also seeks a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the results of the trials. The results are in any case favorable for women and children. The perpetrators get stiff conditions and / or fines; Divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive prosecution of the child's aunt demonstrates that these female criminal officials are gender neutral in law enforcement. Also noteworthy is the respect treated by all parties, including those found guilty. This is a very important and well made movie. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms Longinotto, also starred in the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related themes in Tehran.) (In broken English with English subtitles). My grade: B + 8/10
