Didn't know anything about the movie until I was watching, and I think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure in the first place and later as it was more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The story had holes / jumps which I think throw the audience away a bit. There is no good soundtrack in the background, which creates the "romantic" mood. BUT they didn't play all. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was an inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I write this review. The subtle love production of the two actors was amazing, and I think this is the core of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; In fact, not everyone we appreciate will. I had to sit for a while and began to slowly understand the little things I didn't catch first. I cannot guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you do.
