Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an early Peter Finch as gentleman in the manor house in some god-forsaken plantations, where there is always danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen, staying in the midday sun and going to kindergarten. Eventually, they do after typhoid or cholera outbreaks, of course, and much chaos follows. Taylor replaced a scary Vivien Leigh in this boiler / adventure flick. When the elephants storm the house and catch Liz on the big stairs, I still get goose bids. Thank goodness Dana Andrews is around to save the day. One of my favorite culprits. Also in color!
