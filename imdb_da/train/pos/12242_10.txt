I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 oh 5 times to see it to realize what a great movie was. Firstly, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't normally see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and Nazi government show themselves more "humanized". One of the facts that impressed me most was the envelope of the film about a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20 years ... the forest is the place where the last chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: It is the forest where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another track for those who like the details is the rendering of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they cross a door or a door opens. Many doors are displayed on the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. Whenever happening. Did you notice that?
