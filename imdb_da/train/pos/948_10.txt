This is simply one of the finest renderings of Dick's classic tale. The script follows very precisely the story originally written by Dickens and captures a perfect balance between a movie atmosphere and a gaming atmosphere. Viewers who love either format will find plenty of history rooted in their presentation choices. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a lovely realistic approach to Scrooge's character and is very convincing in character development initiated by the ghost's visit. I found out he was able to win me to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, something rarely done in other versions. The amazing work done by the supportive actors attaches great importance to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas Carol versions I've seen.
