Talent Detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his overseas journey to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide, he has good reason why suspicion is really much more, a rather delicate complex murder! <br /> <br /> As far as killing mystery films are concerned, it just doesn't get any better than this. Fortified with suspicious signs, all associated with a dog show and all of which have very good reason to murder the apparently suicidal victim of Archer Coe, it's really hard to figure out one or hang your head around it, but boy, it shows look fascinating to see unfold before us. Even the police, the criminal and the district attorney prove colorful, generous characters add a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one case and reinforce its overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the comic scenes that involved corons (played by Etienne Girardot), which always seem to be rude and uninterrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during his lifetime. Also Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath welcomes, often later delightfully humorous at his expense, critical comment during Vance's investigation. I can't think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it hasn't dated very well. Don't stop the movie from being just plain good fun though. See and see if you can pack your head around this mystery mystery. Highly recommended you try!
