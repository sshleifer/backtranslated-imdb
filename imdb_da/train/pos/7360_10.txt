wow! this is a great movie! The action was not good at all, but if you look at some moments in the movie, rewind and watch it again, it's genius! The man at the start of the movie goes with his suitcase against a tree. WOW! I had never expected it. Then he puts coke in a suitcase and runs away. I testify that smoking guy against the three was one of his friends who sold the drugs later. And genius quotes: '' fine shades, I need a few '' '' 'their yours .. if you think you can take them ..' '.. just brilliant! And the battles are the best I've seen for a while. Look at the other guy he is taking down after he has hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT IS A HEAT! And in the middle of the movie, a guy in a car shot once, so 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. Hiring these guys like him costs a lot of money. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walked up and down the stairs for 5 minutes and shot Jason Peters after his distraction. Jason Peters falls down and rolls back while he's dead! I can't say in several words how great this movie is!
