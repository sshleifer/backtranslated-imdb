This movie is a half-documentary ... and it's pretty interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of Norwegian saboteurs managed to stop the heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and the release of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could have been a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboteurs are played by themselves! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the story of World War II and movies, it is a movie worth seeing !!
