Fritz Lang's German medieval saga continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge his murdered husband Siegfried. His brother is too weak to bring the murdered garden to justice. Kriemhild marries Etzel, the King of Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to a party. Ezel and the other dogs should wedge the hedge, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a great blow to life and death begins and she sets the whole fire on fire. The garden is dead, and it is Kriemhild. These films are about big themes like revenge and immortal love. We have later seen some better movies made of these subjects, but this was one of the early ones.
