Some of those who watch movies and complain about them to live forget something: DVD menu system. I tell you the people, I saw the main screen repeat in this about 35 times. It was great. A cinematic rug of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was from the beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was hooked. Over and over and over. And over. <br /> <br /> "Doot de Doot, the dead doom." And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I was put aside in bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and tonight is soft again. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses in me is already equipped. I popped into the DVD. I was fascinated. Through the night. "Doot the Doot, the Doo the Dodedo." <br /> <br /> The Blob. See it. Steve Queen, two police and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
