There were many 50-sci-fi movies. They were great moves to the Drive-in theaters. Many of them were crazy even then. This movie and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' stand out and both have a good age in their own way. From the beginning with its creepy theremin musical score (which still sounds weird as theremins are almost never used) Forbidden Planet takes you where nobody has gone before. Talking about Star Trek, there is so much material in this movie that came into the Star Trek TOS, it's like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain / first mate / doctor, the mad scientist, alien creatures, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; It's all right now, but it was the first of its kind. In addition, it has a good play and well-executed work of art, which today creates a certain awe in the picture. Consider how the large Krell machine is depicted with a real depth. I saw this as a child (at a drive-in: 0), as it was a new movie, and it scared me. Of course, every movie that itself was vaguely scary made back, but I remember being really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie, a sci-fi fan can see several times and find something new with each view.
