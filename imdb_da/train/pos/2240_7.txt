My beloved love for the Italian actor Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped jump in my puberty with her performance in the 1965 "Thunderball", has led me to some rather unusual places. Case in point, this 1959 British curiosity, "Carlton-Browne from F.O.," which contains Lucianna in one of her former roles. She plays a princess in this, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both of their stars were certainly on their way up at this time. In this sweet, often very funny movie, we learn about the Madeira-like island nation of Gaillardia, which had been a British colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered, and Her Majesty sends the foreign office bumbling Carlton-Browne to take responsibility. Terry-Thomas teaches this part nicely, as well as the sellers in his role as prime amphibulos in the small country. (This was Sellers' second movie from 1959 on a small country that matched the wits with the world, the other is "The Mouse That Roared". Of course) Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as Gaillardia's suave king, and my girl Lucianna is as appealing as that may be in her small role. The film shows much in the way of very dry humor, although there are some stomach pains to have (reception at the Gaillard airport, for example, and especially the May Day style parade of Gaillardian strength). And Sellers' seedy prime minister, with his cracked English and seemingly eternal sweat stains, is another memorable character in this great actor pantheon. Despite the occasional occurrence or two uncorkable, rigid-upper-lip British gibberish, I found this image to be a winning modest entertainment and well presented at this crisp-looking Anchor Bay DVD.
