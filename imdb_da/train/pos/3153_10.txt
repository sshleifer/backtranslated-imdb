I want to make it short and sweet because I don't think there is much you can really tell anyone about this show, which has never seen anything but its hilarious and unique, for me it may be the funniest show ever . <br /> <br /> You really need to see it to understand its humor and it took me some episodes to really get into it, but when your in there hasn't returned. For example, how Hydes' character will always see his friends come in some sort of trouble, the more it happens, the more fun it becomes. <br /> <br /> I think the all-round classic I cast, the authors, the director, is just a recipe for success. An actor, I think who's always having trouble is Ashton Kutcher, but I think he's great in this show, I don't think it's possible for the character Kelso to have been played by anyone else, takes someone very smart to play someone who stupid. All the protagonists are great and it would not be a worthwhile review if I didn't mention coal fox Mila Kunis, now it's a spicy meet a ball ha have all the fun aside, great show.
