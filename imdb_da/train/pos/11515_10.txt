It has been so many years since I saw this, but I feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the variety of meaning here. That's what humor I suppose. It is subjective. It either charges through your fun 60,000 volt leg or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the UK's best comics put together in a story that is silly and irreversible and the result is fun. The dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered, and the two leaders (Cleese and Lowe) are excellent together. This was made for them. <br /> <br /> I can say nothing more than ask you to find this and see it. You will not be disappointed, and in a world without gentle humor this is a classic inan and harmless piece of comic brilliance.
