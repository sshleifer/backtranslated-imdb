I watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. It is amazing to see not only what a great person Darius is, but how admirable the rest of the team is also and at such a young age. It also made me think about how disgusting MTV was, and how to get the opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way, they fell. Shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and hearty warming story ... take your tissue, but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth today can be.
