Since I'm so interested in seamstresses, I've really dug this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like it so awful, the good movie types check it out. The effects are also good and you just have to think "Land of the lost". I have initially seen this movie in the early 90s perhaps more like 89/90 on a local channel sample show called "Morgus Presents". I didn't scare me, but I was 8, and something B felt more like an A. Years later I watched it on DVD in a local Circuit City and bought it right away so I can give it a 9 because it has a personal place in my heart right there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
