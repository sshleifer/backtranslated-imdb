This movie is very fun. What matters especially well are two things: one is the simple way that characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There is an endearing seriousness to the parody that is very appealing; the other is basically the sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special note as the subject of Mr. Furious's wishes. There is a boatload of talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is very fun and sweet.
