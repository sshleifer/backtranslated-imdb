This movie was absolutely wonderful. Pre-partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully. Urmila has given another excellent performance. What I really admire about this movie is that it does not rely on Pakistan bashing that runs violently in films like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a background, the film does not redirect to political problems or focuses on violence or what is right and wrong. The film is always centered on the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been depicted excellently. The film actually shows how the people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffer from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is really widespread in this movie.
