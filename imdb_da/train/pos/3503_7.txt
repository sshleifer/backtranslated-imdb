If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy / girlfriend or first puppy love fling ... this movie is for you! OK so this movie would and will never win an Oscar, but as a Dominican I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that might just go over your head if you're not part of the culture ... kids are raised by a grandmother who is both mother and father, the youngest son becomes baby and bathed with a Cafe Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy is harassed by neighborhood men, goes to church and illuminates a prayer candle ... the movie's brilliance was in these small details. Granted, it was not an extract from all the works, but it was not supposed to be NOR, it was supposed to be a training tool for those who wanted to learn about Latin culture (tip: make new friends instead). More of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumenty, this movie kept it real without taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" it was simply a boy who came in an age story. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
