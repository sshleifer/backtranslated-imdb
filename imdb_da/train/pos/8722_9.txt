Initially, it is a very fun movie with a couple of crazy characters running around that are bound to laugh (see the two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but it's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised, and the film's protagonists undergo some evolution to rise up against the grasshoppers in the end. And it also has some amazing voice-overs by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. It's just amazing. All details, beautiful colors, every ants look different, beautiful backgrounds ... And girls and girls at Pixar made it all so realistic. All in all, a very nice job. This is the best animation of Disney since Aladdin.
