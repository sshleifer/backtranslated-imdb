Holy shit this is so hysterical! Why aren't American comedies written like this? For anyone who thinks that comedy should be stupid - there is more intelligence and intelligence in the six episodes in this series than in a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I couldn't believe it was the same guy as the House! There are so many good lines and gags in this series, you could see every show dozens of times and still pick up new items every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put on butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as always as the somewhat stubborn heart of the series, "The Suppressed Mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone is messing with a Wellington, he really puts his foot in it" and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder "the top kipper seller" and homicidal swordsman from Scotland.
