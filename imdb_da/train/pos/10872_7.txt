Elections mark the 2nd test film directed at Johnnie To. <br /> <br /> Marvelously, Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai threw as Lok and Big D as the two trial members selected as candidates for the post of President of the Ho Sing community, a 100-year-old experimental association. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who keeps his cool all the time, Big D is not only impatient but also believes he is on top of everything. Lok was elected deputy chairman for 2 years. To get the overall control of the gang, the newly elected president has to go down with a Dragon Baton who represents power and authority. Big D was extremely dissatisfied with the results that he was not elected to be the next chairman after paying a beautiful figure of bribes to councilors. He ordered his husband to get Baton before falling on Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D gets Baton, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the trial movie's theme movie, where there is no need for much bloodshed. Johnnie To put man's greed in the film where bloodshed is commonly used in other experimental films to show how man's greed can cause death or decline in one. However, not a single ball is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in elections. It is the battle of the testimony that makes choices out of the rest. In addition to Maggie Shiu, the only actress of choice with less than 5 lines to speak throughout the film, masculinity governs the entire movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who were seen in To's earlier films, were cast as an undercoat and a gangster who sold his life to the gang. Along with some of the veteran actors who look in the film and the excellent script, it is the only HK film that represents Cannes Fil Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> Elections have hardly failed critics who want a second sample social film.
