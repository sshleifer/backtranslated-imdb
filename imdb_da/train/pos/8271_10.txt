One of the greatest hits in 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama with regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a great star. It's patented Haines all the way: Brash smart aleck who takes something serious until he is rejected by everyone, gets up and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one worked this formula like Haines. An amazing comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expressions. He is a total delight in this movie as he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton co-star. This movie is known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and to be John Wayne's film debut as a Yale football player (but I've never seen him). Haines was a top-five-box office star starting with this picture through 1932. It's a shame he has been pretty much forgotten and that most of his movies seem to be lost. He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time.
