Expected to see another Nunsploitation movie with a moderate mother Superior abusing and torturing her fees, Flavia proved to be much more than I had expected. It actually has a feminist story, though I don't think such a term existed during the time the movie is set. It was certainly not practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very dimmed and locked into points of view in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) testifies of her time until she just can't sit there anymore and actually does something about it, though with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> Forkredit sequence has Flavia as young young near a battlefield. She sees an injured "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still living) and tries to help him. Before she can, her filled father hates the soldier and bends her head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). Her father then forces her to attend a monastery where she witnesses even more injustice. Although scenes involve violence, rape and nuns, I will consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a creepy exploit are there, but acting, camera work, history and music are too good to keep it down that level. Most "non" movies I've seen, usually have the basic premise for: A good girl walks up into a monastery where Mother Superior is a tallest bitch who likes to whip people and / or make their lives a living hell. Flavia spends much of the first part of his film passively questioning all the atrocities that are happening around her. Much of her inaction is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-sprouted (but a little loony-she likes to piss outside me, but it's much easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their monastery, Flavia and Agatha do not flaunt in fear like the other nuns. In fact, their invaders act as their liberators (of the cruelty and slavery of cruelty). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader who scares dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her as dirt. Her Muslim lover tells her in a very endless time. I will not give too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, ruined and sad. This is a great movie, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a garbage game. Plus, how on earth could a movie with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I'm not familiar with Mar√≠a Casare's other works, but Sister Agatha is a fate. <br /> <br /> I've read many good reviews of the Synaps (US) release, but I love my German X-Nominal Cool DVD copy. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a bit more image information on all sides than Synapses release. <br /> <br /> And there are also many good, wise or fun lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God man? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? They are all male! " - Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are scared - look at them, sister - afraid their power will be taken away from them!" -SR. Agatha (about Christians fleeing after Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going?" The Muslims cannot do anything for you that Christians have not done! Have Ha! "Sr. Agatha (for a group of fleeting Christian women) <br /> <br />" Lord bless these Muslims - to put fear in these pompous Christians. "Flavia <br /> <br />" Must it just looks a Muslim to make you your underwear? "Sr. Agatha. Closing message:" Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a shining nun. The idea for the film came from events that occurred during the muslim invasions in Italy, culminating in what even today is remembered as THE MARTYRDOM OF 800 AT OTRANTO "
