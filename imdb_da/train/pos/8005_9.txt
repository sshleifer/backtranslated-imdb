I bought this game on eBay after hearing that it was a similar game to Elite. The game is actually very similar and is very addictive. Once I played it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could have fun too .... I've played this game right through and the story makes it feel As if you're actually in a movie, it's brilliant. If you're having trouble feeling free to explore because of the story's restrictiveness in the single-player game, just create a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do and the software is included) and play for your heart's content. There are still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatens because you didn't often mean other players unless you wanted to. So take a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single player campaign, and create an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is staggering, with large systems to explore and find wrecks, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Great game and especially as you can get it to a few quid on eBay. Get one with the full written manual, if you can (blue box, not Xplosive red box), it's much better!
