This is a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love dancing and running into this movie in the video business. We had to get it. Without violence and such warming it is a good movie to relax and just enjoy your evening. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a sweet movie.
