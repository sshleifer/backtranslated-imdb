I consider myself a great movie buff. I was sick on the couch and appeared in this movie. Right from the opening to the end I saw in awe of these great actors I had never seen, say good word. The movie was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message will be heard about any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and it beats his actors all the way through. Thank you for making a movie like this. Just wonderfully awkward, beautiful kind of characters that are flawless and graceful at once. Just fantastic. I cannot submit this without 10 lines in total, so I just want to continue saying that I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this movie and more from the author. I didn't want it to end. end
