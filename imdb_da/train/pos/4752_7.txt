A celebrating story of a martian attempt to colonize the earth. (Things must be pretty bad back on Mars.) Two state troops are investigating the scene of a reported UFO crash. Whatever landed is buried under the ice of Tracy's Pond, but there are footprints in the snow leading to a nearby dining room. The diner didn't have any customers since the morning. Now, there are a handful of bus passengers sitting and waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on board the bus, even though he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to resume. One of them is a stranger, but which one? Everyone is a suspect. There is the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub pink wit. There is a throbbing businessman to come to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Extensive performance of the man, Ron Kipling.) Apart from couples, no one has noticed anyone else. And even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride for newly painted man: "I could have sworn, you had a mole on your chin." The story goes on in a crisp but slightly ghostly way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and off, the jukebox turns itself on - and none of it must be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble game and the climax revelation is worth a chuckle. There is no traceable "depth" to it. It's not a moral message about pod people who mask like normal citizens. It's not a warning of any kind, just an adventure that diverts and mourns. I always enjoy it when it's on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the annoying and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman senator who mastered the murder of Julius Caesar in MGM's version of Shakespeare's play. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
