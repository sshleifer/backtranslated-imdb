I just watched a press screening of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It is not often that I see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. I really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together again. I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together by camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... Without giving away too much, I just want to say there's a surprise that leaves you hanging ... The old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke segments packed a bunch of surprises that seem realistic and resemble the experiences I've had in the big apple. All over the film is a great place to take a date ... especially if you are already fond of the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next in Love of Cities.
