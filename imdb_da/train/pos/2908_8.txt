A journey of discovery follows this film the life of a family living in a sleepy island in British Columbia. Languorous and dreamy, residents are happy to let life go around them until a young, newborn teacher, with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland. Slowly, their indolent state is awakened, the father (and principal of the local school) seeking excitement, the mother of stability, the eldest daughter of love, and the youngest of power. Although it's not an incredible or groundbreaking movie theater, the movie is quietly comfortable and good for a tired evening when the wind is blowing. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
