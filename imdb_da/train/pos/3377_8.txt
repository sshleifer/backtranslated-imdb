Soylent Green is a classic. I've been waiting for someone to do it again. They seem to be reusing sci-fi classics these days (ie World World), and I hope some directors / producers will restore Soylent Green. With today's computer animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a good image. Anti-utopian movies may not be so far out. The humans race like cockroaches without external influences to limit it. We as humans have the ability to put kibosh on the production of smaller species if they come out of hand, but there is nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. In spite of all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control pills, etc., humanity still changes as bacteria in a Petri dish. Classic Malthusian economy says that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their purpose of life. 6 billion and growing .... it is indecent.
