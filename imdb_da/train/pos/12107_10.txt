I watched this movie as a child on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty scary movie, but not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD and it differs from what I remember because in the DVD I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and / or Italian and there is no subtitle . Then the other actors respond in English to what was said. Kind of strange. Also on the DVD box, some of the players' names are spelled differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this movie is different because Elsie's character takes off her clothes and gives a nude shot in a scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to come out with her pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. This scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there are extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced ​​and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where is the master tape and all the unused recordings? <br /> <br /> Apart from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herber's face after Julia clubs he is a good one). The scary atmosphere and Barbara Steele's weird, exotic and seductive look make the movie much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele hadn't been in this movie, it would be a great zero. She makes the movie a ten!
