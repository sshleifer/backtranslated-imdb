I was starting to lose faith in recent movies that were flooded with the typical Hollywood movie genre. History lines fail and camera work is only copied from the last movie of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical storyline enchanting, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and jumps you into Europe in 1945. We have all seen death put on the screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of this movie is how it takes you through every slow moment leading you to death. Unlike many movies, after a second, it doesn't cut (for example) a knife, but forces you to see the devastating but sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all take something else away from what this movie is trying to say, but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I would love to speak more thoroughly about the movie to the one who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
