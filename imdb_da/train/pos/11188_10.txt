I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this movie has made me an even bigger fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the family Creed. They just moved into a new house and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. Creed's new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. The funeral is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a person (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person they are evil. Shortly after Jud explains everything about Pet Sematary, everything begins to go to hell. I will not explain more because I do not want to give away some of the main parts of the movie. The play that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed some work. History was one of the most important parts of this film, primarily because it was so original and poignant. This movie contains lots of make-up effects that make the movie image scary and scary. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent shivers up to its back was actually the make-up effects. There is a sign in this movie that is really freaky. This character is "Zelda." This particular character appears in the movie about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who passed by years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the film is not generally frightening because she doesn't speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the live **** scares me the second time. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good plays, first rate plot and fascinating make-up. This is really one of the most favorite horror movies all the time. 10 out of 10
