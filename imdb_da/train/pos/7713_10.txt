Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in outer space with special monster features (often ridiculous as explosion sounds in space in space). Although tame with today's standards, the special effects of the "Forbidden Planet" were quite striking for their time. Even today, they still maintain plausibility. Nevertheless, the best part of the movie may be the reason why radio broadcasters still have an appeal. Much of what was going on was left to the public's imagination. (What did the Krell creatures look like?) By having much of the frame of history, never revealed or only revealed in the end, the excitement and excitement of the whole movie kept. The end was also very thoughtful and satisfying. It is, in my opinion, still one of the best (if not best) sci-fi movies ever made.
