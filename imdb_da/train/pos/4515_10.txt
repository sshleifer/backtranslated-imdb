The movie is amazing !! If you see it with your friends, it can be a nice day ... Of course, you must know that the movie is stupid and very badly directed and acted (Tomba / Unziker, what a couple), and that is probably the worse movie in world, but you can enjoy it a lot. We saw it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first when the criminals kill Alex's friend and he tries to act as a desperate, and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then when he refers to Leva (Antevleva, what a name) "Palassio di giusstissia", and saw the accident of Leva, who once goes on his car out of the way, and a second later the car is completely empty! What a magic!
