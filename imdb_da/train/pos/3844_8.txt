When you read the summary of this movie, you might think that this is something of a strange movie, and in some ways it is for the main movie of this movie, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions Gerard see are all (more or less) subtle hints about what will happen to him as the story goes on, and it's fun for the viewer to try to figure out the symbolism used in the movie. Despite the use of symbolism and a few tips for the end of the movie, the film maintains a very high voltage level all the time and does not become dull for one minute. This is mostly due to the great achievements of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of all of Paul Verhoeven. His steering style is clearly visible, and one can say that one sees at different angles that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven film. Not only will it be typical of people who are familiar with his American films because of nudity and graphic violent scenes, but it will also be typical of people who are familiar with his Dutch films because of the same things and his talent for to tell a great story. When people look at Verhoeven's American film, short-sighted people can say that he has no talent in telling a good story and only focusing on blood and sex. That's what some people think while I think he's a very talented director trying to convey a deeper message in each with each movie. Although it's not a good movie, Hollow Man (his last American movie) is an example of Verhoeven being able to do more than science fiction splatter movies, and perhaps companies should trust him more and offer him several different movies for the helm. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movie. Not only do they show that he needs some freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
