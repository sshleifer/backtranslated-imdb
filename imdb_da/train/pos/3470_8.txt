Although I'm quite young, The Beatles is my absolute FAVORITE band! I have never had the chance to hear their music as it was publishing, but have loved them since I remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that is worth trying at that time. I can see why it was not released in the cinema, but it is definitely a good movie to put on the TV. I flicked through my TV guide and happened to watch this movie, it didn't do much detail except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles broke up, Jared Harris Stars'. I had never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. But they are certainly underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The movie had a slow start, but when it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a big fan, I kind of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was brilliant, and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! Quinn played McCartney quite well, but sometimes entered his Irish accent. Make-up artists made them look great. <br /> <br /> This section can be considered as a * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, it was a slow start, but soon developed and became quite an emotional movie. I found bit in the park a total waste of time and totally out of character for both musicians. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, completely unnecessary. The end was very exciting and brings a tear to the eye when I see it. It's quite different from the other biographical movies I've seen where it's about how The Beatles came together and became famous, and they really didn't make those characters as well. Eg. "Backbeat". In summary, if you are a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance that you may have a pleasant surprise. In just about 95 minutes it is worth waiting for the film to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, send it to the 'comments page' of this movie, I am very interested.
