Every time, the conversation becomes "favorite movie". I will mention the Titanic and at least a few people will snicker. I don't pay them anything because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears with the right movie. And they are too embarrassed now to admit it. <br /> <br /> I rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to just enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find out that the movie has not lost its power during these five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I remember how a movie that nobody thought would break became the most popular movie all the time. A movie that burst into public awareness like no other movie I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people will not even admit that they enjoyed it. People, let's get something right - you don't look tough when you badmouth this movie. You look like an indescribable cynic. No movie is perfect and this one has a few flaws. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot around the two lovers comes together a little too nicely. None of this is so distracting that it destroys the movie. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the great actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him more than a beautiful boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie was really her and she kept it together beautifully. <br /> <br /> James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a truly credible Titanic. The descending scenes were terrible, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was completely transfixed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a memorable scene after another. Titanic leaves port in Southampton. Rose and Jack on the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right in front!" The screws are incredibly out of the sea. They cried screams after she went down. And it ended up bringing even the most modest man in the theater to tears. <br /> <br /> The music, which has also been the victim of the movie's success, was an important ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Sin Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this amazing piece of music for so many. I confess I am a Titanic buff. As such, I was pleased to see the ship as we never saw it - in all its beauty. Perhaps the sinking hit me more than some because I had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were titanic buffs. I welcome Cameron to bring this story to the masses in a way that never dimmed the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open your hearts to the Titanic and you will not be disappointed.
