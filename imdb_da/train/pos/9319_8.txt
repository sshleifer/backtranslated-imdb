....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando etc. The man was pretty broad and a scream. I love watching him interact with Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or who - he obviously had a ball, and I think he also made it easier for his guests - as long as they were in advance, it was not a disciplined , 19 take the form of production. Relax and loose, was clearly the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe also Jerry Lewis as well. Great timing, old gags that kept the audience in the sting for decades, pure pleasure about what he did. His sad little clown he played was also good - but in a narrow way. Personally, I think he is great, just bought a two DVD set of his shows from '61 or so, it brings his stuff back in a good way to me. I remember watching him on television at the end of his run when he ran the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you're a fan or curious. He was a rebellion.
