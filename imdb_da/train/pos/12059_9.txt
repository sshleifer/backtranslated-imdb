I love ghost stories in general, but I especially love cool, atmospheric and elegant incredible periodic-style British ghost stories. This one is qualified on all points. A naive young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the coast to settle the estate of an elderly woman. It is the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons go to sea on vacation for "their health." Well, guess what is nothing "healthy" about the village of Crythin Gifford, the frightening side of the older woman's hulking, brooding Victorian property lying on the edge of a misty swim salt marsh. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals will help it threaten - you find out why later in the movie), he unforgettably triggers the anger of a malicious spirit, the woman of black. She is not a filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of evil and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malicious presence in each frame. As the camera creeps up on the lawyer while reading through legal papers, you expect to see the woman in black at any time. When the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to power the scary old house, the camera turns on him, and you think she'll pop up there too. Waiting for the woman in black to appear is nail-exciting exciting. We've seen many elements in this story before (the locked room that no one enters, the fog, the naive outsider who ignores the local people's warnings), but somehow the director manages to combine them all into a whole new apparent and Convincing ghost story. See it with a friend so you can get someone to tackle while waiting for the woman in black. . .
