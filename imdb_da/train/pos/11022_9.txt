FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> Do not expect credibility with action movies, where the superhero must perform an endless series of incredible feats that are threatened in the process but regain at lightning speed and turn innocent gadgets into deadly weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin heads. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the movie has many assets: Magnificent photographed stunning scenery, amazing special and visual effects (the first five minutes are gripping and giving the sound of the movie), excellent musical scores, welcome attempts at levitation to relieve some of the excitement and a solid cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, have the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than his reason), a charming heroin (Janine Turner) and one of the most darstardian bunch of villains ever (priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - for longer than usual and who gets the most out of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass). Good solid entertainment, if not credible. As Roger Ebert wrote another movie, "It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
