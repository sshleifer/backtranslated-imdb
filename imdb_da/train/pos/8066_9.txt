One of John Ford's best films 'The Informer' has no grand scenery of the American West. Instead, the intense drama Ford was known to play on the no less robust terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen's face. The former prize fighter, who once confronted Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Oscar-winning portrayal of the ravaged IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The reason is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin, a starving and humiliated man who has been thrown out of the IRA to be able to kill an informant in cold blood, becomes an informant himself. For Â£ 20 he betrays a friend to "Tans", and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly changing violence, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. <br /> <br /> It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo, the movie's most impressive achievement. In most movies, a burly lout of Gypo's type would be thrown like the tongue, at best he would have two or three lines and be discarded quickly, so the hero and villain could get their showdown. In 'The Informer', Gypo is both a hero and a villain, while the show is in its inner turmoil, where every single part is explicitly shared with the audience. Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, RKO Ford provided a very modest budget. The director and his collaborators, especially cinematographer Joseph H. August, did this to their advantage by creating a claustrophobic masterpiece on a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer', John Ford won his first along with winner of best manuscript and best score.
