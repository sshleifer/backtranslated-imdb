Mr. Blandings builds his dream house can be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love raising baby, Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I was a male war bride or it is a wonderful life - movies made with white, flavor and and occasionally tongue stuck in the cheek, check this out. Post WWII life is simply and idyllic portrait. <br /> <br /> Grant is the absolute top in its form, playing the city's mice waiting for life in an international game. Loy is lovely like her before now wife. The casting of supporting characters compares to that you cannot take it with you and contains an early bit of future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are far above par. The movie never encounters the low-rent, -the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
