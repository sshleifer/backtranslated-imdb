In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot college students who decide to bring their successful college musical Manhattan Melodies to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet with Muppets. After being denied by many manufacturers, Scooter suggests that Muppets decide to move on alone. But Kermit still thinks he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally does it and let's all know he was selling the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others don't know where he is. <br /> <br /> This includes many amazing scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced Muppet Babies, a honeymoon filled with Muppets, including Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter as a cinema usher and a scene where Rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters were not included anymore. Of course, many of them appear on the wedding, but there should have been some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and the lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie as if he were in The Muppet Show last season and The Great Muppet Caper and Miss Piggy's dog Foo Foo should have been with her too (Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a major role in this movie, and he wasn't particularly known at that time).
