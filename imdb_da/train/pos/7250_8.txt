I first read the book when I was young, so watch the movie late one night. About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no available copies. I then hit the internet and found a site that offers War Films, so glad I did, ordered a copy and sat back and confirmed why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I track down a copy via E-bay, author Alan White was World War II command / paratrooper who participated in various secret operations, and that was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and the film's authenticity. I haven't given the movie a ten just because of the nature of the end of the movie, not as good as the book. There are a few plot lines that differ from the book as well, which is strange as the book is not about the big scale of war, but about the individual at war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the movie to let him see in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can track it down in the book and the movie then it is definitely worth it and I only wish it was more accessible for more to read and see, one of my very best war movies ever !
