This is one of the best made films from 2002. Perhaps it's not the best movie, but it looks best, has great plays and is perfect for Sam Mendes, who made his debut with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) at one of his jobs. Michael's boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) believes it will be okay, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) raises both his father and Michael, leading to Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and his second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose and send a hitman Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. When Michael is a respected man within the organization, he tries to win some friends who can help him, including boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). In a way, Road to Perdition is a standard gangster movie but it's so well made that you almost can't see it. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its film. All of these elements are able to surprise and create excitement, even though the result is quite safe. That Hoechlin is not an annoying child, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps of course. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic book, this movie is so much better than you would expect, and even if it is wrong it belongs to better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize that you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in this area. Watch this movie that looks at times but is brand new in many areas.
