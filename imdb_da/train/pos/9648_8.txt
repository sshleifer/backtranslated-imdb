I liked this movie a lot. The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story at all, and you are left to wonder what really happened. Since I like this kind of movie, I've had it here. I especially like "dating" scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives. And of course, any movie with a nude Staphane Rideau will get a few extra points. ;-)
