Kudos to Fawcett to take on roles which at that time were considered controversial. For my recollection, rape was still a taboo issue in the 1980s, and women's rights and feelings were rarely so deeply studied during that time. Fawcett is simply a woman followed and then pursued by actor James Russo. He is appropriate as the occupied psychopath, but sometimes slightly transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a small role, just like Alfre Woodard as a housemate. Woodard cares about the legal consequences when Fawcett, rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. The place where she throws a frying pan of hot oil on Russo is classic, and as he says, he deserves it. She then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be confronted. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the feelings and rage of rape victims who have been violated, physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 8.10.
