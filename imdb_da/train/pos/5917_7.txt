Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique movie directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is an entertainment in the cinema and it is very worth seeing. It is live action mixed with animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary song in the south, almost as if it is an answer to that flick. Philip Michael Thomas, who later becomes Don Johnson's sidekick at Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are imprisoned. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, the Barry White) are Thomas' friends and plan to help him escape the prison. They are stuck to a police force, and Crothers tells Thomas a story of a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and gives many amazing things to see. Like all Bakshi's movies, most will be annoyed and will not like the animation. True animation lovers will forgive their clunkiness and fall in love with their ingenuity. The film is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about fighting between the races. For a long time I thought I saw something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished seeing it, it started to seem more like a scam like Superfly. It's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Regardless of the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cool movie fans. 10.7.
