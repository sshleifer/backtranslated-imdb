Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was just so weak. And Lincoln's portrayal was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the sign he played was nothing but a salary. Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise bursting smart ass with no respect for the law or the court. I mean, who in the hell should he be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll just call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford should be a great fun guy, but I didn't like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, speaks as a really sweet simple and does not seem to know that they should sit in a courtroom. How do I take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Twist was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to be thought of by some 5 year olds in his or her dreams. To say I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I must say it is good enough, nothing that entertaines me and makes me laugh can be bad, but this lively and stupid story was just so ridiculous that I cannot understand how anyone could contemplate the big. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea how historically this movie was, but if any of it was right, I really had to shake my head.
