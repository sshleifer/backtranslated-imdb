This is a great story of family loyalty, which fortunately does not indicate the usual tricks (or at least those I am used to watching in American and European films) of super-sentimentality or high dramatic excitement. <br /> It is very visible and very lovable. It has a beautiful filmography, but does not trust it alone to entertain.
