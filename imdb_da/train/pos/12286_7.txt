I liked the movie, first and foremost because it told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt it was condensed by a much longer story. Since the book is over 400 pages, it makes sense. It spans a period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious South American country, also much to fit into the free time. I think it would have been much better than a six-hour mini-series than it turned out to be a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Though hasty, the story doesn't jump so much that it gets confusing. What is told is told quite well. One mistake is that Clar's supernatural powers seem inconsistent; either they should have been smoother during the film, or they should have been omitted. Two additional bugs (which could be spoilers): Esteban's final return to goodness is happening suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to be worn, even though history's tone suggests it must endure forever. <br /> <br /> The action is excellent. Glenn Close, like the tormented spinster Ferula, is excellent. Jeremy Irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is great even though she is often even better than she was in this movie. There were also many well-executed minor roles as well. The biggest mistake is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect trainer; every actor seemed to speak in another kind of accent.
