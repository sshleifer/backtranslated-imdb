There is a particular genius behind this movie. I laughed all the way through. The scene in the telephone room discusses how love heals the doppelganger was a good attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the author's message and they have some talent. Doppelganger split at the end was like ... "ok, didn't expect it quite, but let's see what the movie has to say". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent with the story in a strange way. Is it the meaning of a movie to be logical, or is it entertaining or communicating at an emotional level? I'm bored easily by many movies, but this kept my interest all the way through. I think the story can have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Terribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person might have done (with more experience).
