In the ten years since Wildside aired, there is nothing that has really come close to the quality of local production. This includes the two series of the entertaining, but overrated, Underbelly, which has brought life events to the latest criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The miniseries Blue Murder (as well as star Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception. Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on ABC. Having not seen the show for a while, I am still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by his son's disappearance, Rachael Blake (who was later anchored with Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young policeman if vice is gambling. Equally good support roles are provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself) and a young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> ABC just explained the first three episodes on DVD a few years ago. The logic of this kind of marketing is beyond me, but I guess it may have something to do with licensing discrepancies with the original manufacturers. <br /> <br /> A great series that has lived remarkably well. Here we hope that ABC's DVD department gets its action together. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC bulletin board, there is some kind of additional DVD release in December 2009)
