I saw this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white television. I remember my father and remarked that "so it happened - Adam and Eve." I remember living the scene when Adam finds Eve, her eyes turned black. I asked my father why was her eyes black and he told me she was tired and hungry. Since I haven't seen this episode for 45 years, I still remember it - the TV broadcasts back and forth with the home plane, scenes of bombs shaking headquarters, with the last scene of the two going away, Adam carrying his packet and Eva following . It may not have been a theatrical work of art, but it has probably been an impression on me all these years.
