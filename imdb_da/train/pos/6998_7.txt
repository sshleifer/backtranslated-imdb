Going into see seven pounds I wasn't quite sure what to think because the previews went very open to understanding what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 minutes or you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is happening and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All this comes to an end when "twist", so to speak, is unraveled in last-minute movies. Basically, Tim (Will Smith) was troubled and haunted by a great accident that he did to bring the end of seven peoples lives. In this way, he decides to equip seven new people who need help badly for whom he in turn gives his life. <br /> <br /> The action of this movie is great, which I feel will smith whatever part he looks to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better movies, except the eagle eye I think is up there. She has been in some bad ones but she delivers in this movie. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to understand the character. Although the film's casting was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected, and certainly much slower pace that I was hoping for. However, the film was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie, and everything falls into place. Until then, it just seems like a meaningless love story. Finally, seven pounds believed = seven stars.
