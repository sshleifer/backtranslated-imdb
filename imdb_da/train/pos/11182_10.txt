I'm a pretty big fan of most of the movies that have been based on Stephen King's books. This is one of the most scary and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I just finished revising it for about a tenth time and I still find it heartbreaking and scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is on a safe collision course with the monster car is one that stands out. And "No Fair" released by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
