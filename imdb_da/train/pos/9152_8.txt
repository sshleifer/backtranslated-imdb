This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end has occluded this movie from higher recognition. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feeling for the movie - a feeling of isolation becomes evident very soon because of this film technique. The cruel characters are very well-behaved and are presented especially 'nutcase' called joe. Slow (and naive camera work tastes of 'B' movie to begin with) and very normal, but you quickly get a sense of the impending brutality that is happening. This is one of the most "twisted" movies With regard to cold-hearted violence, after the sudden and incredibly lazy end, I was left to feel disappointed, I would have given the movie a 9 if the end was in line with the rest of the movie, but as it is only a 7 on the strength of 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier in the movie. /> <br /> Give it a watch and excuse the ending!
