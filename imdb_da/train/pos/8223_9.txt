When I first saw this movie, in London in 1958, I was thrown over. I had never seen a movie like this before. It had a strange, hypnotic effect, quite unlike the movies I had seen before, and it was persistent. <br /> <br /> I think Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Of course, the interaction is great in its power to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I will love to hear about it and where it can be purchased.
