True, the idea for this television series may have come out of the huge success that Ally McBeal enjoys worldwide, even here in Germany. However, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. The two main characters work together beautifully. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by the well-known German actor, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, get it ???), played by charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchanging fast romantic party parties and continuously spying on while taking part in sitcom-like criminal cases in Berlin and the surrounding area. In addition, they are helped by a magnificent cast of co-stars, especially their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, a rare gem with great comic potential. Also, the shady wheel dealer, Otto and the noble childhood pal in Felix, Frank, work very well, not to mention Sandra's best friend and camera friend Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All in all, a pleasure to look at Monday's nites: no wonder the series and its stars have received more prizes. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
