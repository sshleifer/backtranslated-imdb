The critics are stupid. This movie is fun and smart. I loved this movie a lot. Why do all this movie hate so much. I wish people would love this movie more than they don't. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are true comedians, and they attach great importance to making this film. I can't see you people out there making movies like them. So people just have to see it and not comment on it. I like this movie. It's okay through it all. There are parts where it became stupid, but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would love this because this movie has the play like the King of Queens show. But it's better than that. I can't believe this was judged so low.
