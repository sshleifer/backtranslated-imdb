Yes, these movies are tops. Can't recommend it more. Gay or healthy it is a great doco for anyone who likes movies. Very fun, sad and interesting. Never boring. Good access. A movie made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the shows and just amazing. If you only find this movie on VHS, it's still very worth seeing. Great. 10 out of 10. I saw part of this doco about ten years ago and didn't understand what I saw. The interviews are very revealing about the egos of the performing artists who are like heavyweight boxers trying to make their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first hour so what a performance. Cool. Track it down.
