Standard rise to fame story that has a few high points. Number one, Lonette McKee as a sister, giving a fantastic star performance. The fact that she never became a great feeling after this is beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supportive character, and we have to focus on the gentle character of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose progress in fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. But when the girls go on stage and perform, the movie comes back to life. The original music by Curis Mayfield is to be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The picture quality was quite low, as well as the production values ​​I guess. All in all, it's worth it.
