Two things haunt you through L'intrus (The Intruder): Who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you see? The end is so shocking that for some time you are lost to answering one of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different situations who do not belong in the scene, so they are exposed to it, kindly or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The protagonist, Louis, is a despicable man. He has rough roads, a strange job and no heart. He needs one and goes after it. He has a heart transplanted and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his search for redemption? A guy as such could cut the neck of the drop of a hat. You know, but Claire Denis does not urge you to judge him. Occasionally there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to dwell somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. She must even punish him. But not Denis. There is the character played by Beatrice Dalle who doesn't want anything with him: don't touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, filming him in his self-absorbed quest. I don't know what her movie is the heart or mind, but it's not the traditional plot basics. Whatever she's filming, you get it eventually. You know who is "the" uninvited, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
