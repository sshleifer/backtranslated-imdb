Thank goodness, ABC picked this up instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience of death and fate early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, pies, talking toys, gravel and other evil things :) While a little "Burtonesque" I certainly think this one enjoys its own niche that doesn't require J Depp or HB Carter to be a terrific playground. Here we can find the joy and sorrows of childhood and adulthood collide into each one and actually make sense and make us live life to the fullest!
