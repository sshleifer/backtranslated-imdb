This movie is stocked with horror movie goodies: chained lunatic, pre-mediated murder, a sour (vaguely lesbian) female scientist with a fucking madman carrying a mask because of his terrible disfigurement, poisoning, creepy castles, werewolf and wife) adultery, killed lovers, Tibetan mystics, crescent / semifinished victims of some unnamed experiment, grave deprivation, mind control, masonry bodies, a lonely road carriage, electrocution, knights in the armor - the party, all topped with an incredibly horrible score and some the worst Foley works ever done. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (though poorly dubbed Spanish Horror movie standards) and some of the editing is just bizarre. In a scene where the leading female evil scientist goes to our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly doubled: "It's great. I don't understand. Explain to me again how this is ..." exhibition scenes that collide This movie, a sudden hand-held cutaway of the girl's thighs, comes out of bed with no apparent reason for anyone but to cover a cut in the bad scientist's "Mwahaha! All your werewolf belongs to me!" talk. Although they went to the disturbance, I do not know because there are lots of other crushing blades everywhere - even allowing the gruesome panning and scanning of the print I saw. <br /> <br /> According to an interview with the star, the director was drunk mostly by the slider, and the movie is similar to it. It is an incoherent mess. It is made even more incoherent in the inclusion of werewolf photography from another movie The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor, but plays part with more aggression and with another shirt and makeup - is there a words in Spanish for "continuity"?) and more upholstery of another actor in wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot. The music is incredibly poorly varying almost randomly from full orchestral crooked house music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (Think of it, it couldn't have been a duet. It could have been a solo. The piano part was so simple that it could have been picked out with one hand while the player slammed away in the other with the other.) <Br /> <br /> This is one of the most confused trance-state-inducing bad movies this year for me. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite Line: "Ilona! This madness and perversion will turn you against!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: The runner, discovers his girlfriend beaten and lost the candle in a cartoon-like surprise demonstration. Rank amateur direct there.
