This and not a particular little overstated Southern Soap Opera was the greatest epic to get out of Hollywood's greatest year 1939. I don't want to restore the obvious Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Provides great cartoon performances. However, I would note two other, less understood elements in this masterpiece. The magnificent final battle sequence that the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs up to the peak of the temple to blow its bugle and warn the regiment is simply grand. It never fails me. Another underrated element in the movie is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as Guru. This is no Fu Manchu caricature, but a well-drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the arms back in India by Alexander The Great") villain. In fact, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and some known figure in the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Swing Your, anti-Nazi channel? Not quite. But still a huge, fun, moving epic.
