"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is filled with a fantastic cast of top performers, such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the kind of character actors that Hollywood no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie Hollywood doesn't do anymore. (The creators of "You've Got Mail" claim that their movie is a remake, but it's just other than a lot of inflated self-esteem.) Whether you have a love for romantic comedies from the 1940s, you'll find "The Shop Around around the corner "not to be wonderful. Just as good with repetitions. Enjoy!
