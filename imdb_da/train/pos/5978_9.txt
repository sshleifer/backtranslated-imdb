This is a real "80 movie": At that time, maybe they made 100 times more films than today, and so many of them are quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Today it is perhaps the same kind of people who would have made cheap "straight-to-video" movies in the eighties, making cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. It is still above the mid-sized trash level: It has a good and fascinating story, and it's pretty well made, I think. In a scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture. Of course, there are also small comos of Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the success of the film, even though they are good in their small roles. The monster, heavy songs "Sammi Curr" looks really awful, especially when he sings. One of the scariest monsters I've seen in horror flicks. I can have nightmares for him next night. Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.
