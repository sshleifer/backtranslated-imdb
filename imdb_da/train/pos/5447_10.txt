Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies like this beloved little gem. The road back in the eighties, early eighties, I discovered this movie, which so many released at the time, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", art and blurbs on the back of the tires tempted and You teased. Of course, an age, movie that I have already mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and the many others, have captured the imagination, and fortunately many years later I still remember some with sensation and some with contempt the many films that help maintain my love for such a genre as parodies or pasties. Did many years after the great success of "Animal House" and saw how it had gone down over the years, I now know that there would be no way that this movie would ever obscure the voucher bucks, get it mentioned above, or It would be in memory, like that of National Lampoon's vacation. <br /> <br /> To be honest, not everything that has borne the national Lampoon Logo has been a wild success, but to me the class reunion is one of my all-time favorite movies, with instantly recognizable characters that the independent Bob Spinnaker played perfectly to Gerrit Graham, as well in Charles Band's "Terror Vision", still lingering in his youth's past. Or how about Stephen Furst's brash and ballsy turning as high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. Which makes me think. As I already said, personal taste does not resist. People can be so cruel so it will never win any prizes or be compared to similar by its comedian comrades. It has some benefits. Being one of the previous scripts written by John Hughes, who would later make one of my own favorites of his work "Weird Science" and have a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary US bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.
