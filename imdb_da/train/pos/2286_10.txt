The people who produced this masterful film have done a good job of a novel that is perhaps the best fiction work focusing on human guilt and human responsibility ever released. Nolte takes on the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it his own, and is true to Vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost ALL (to and from) love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses in this fine fit.
