*** SPOILERS *** On the first WWII movies coming out of Hollywood, it turns out how the war has done these GIs, or in this case, the US Marines that fought in it. 21-year-old Al Schmid, John Garfield, had just started living with a good paying job and earned about $ 40 a week - at local steelworks and girl Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker, whom he was marrying, japsne spoiled him and millions of young Americans by attacking the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Performing his duty as an American citizen Al, immediately joined the US Navy and hoped to return to the japs ​​and knew it was true that the Marines would be the first US combat units to get a crack on them. /> <br /> He finally got his chance when his unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on August 7, 1942, in Guadalcanal, in the remote Solomon Islands, to engage the Japanese who were in control of it. It was during the battle of the Ilu River that Al almost unilaterally stopped a massive Japanese Banzai attack, holding on to his machine gun, wave after wave of suicide attacks by the decided japs ​​until aid or reinforcements finally arrived. It was during the bloody battles, Al was hit on the face of a Jap grenade that ended up blind him. <br /> <br /> Now back in the states confronting a naval hospital, Al faces something far more difficult to overcome then a battalion-sized attack by Japanese or German soldiers. He faces a future where he will never see again and have to trust others to look after or for him! <br /> <br /> We'll see in the movie "Marines Pride" Al battle even harder, so he made the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal just by expressing his disability. Don't want anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to be sorry for him. All in all, the one who feels upset is more than anyone else in the movie. It is with the help of Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp and Ruth along with his American seafarer Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, who eventually gives Al the courage to meet his blindness with the same strength that he faces wave after wave of Japanese troops at Gudalcanal. One against Al thought he lost himself in the godly island of hell in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of US Navy Albert Schmid "Pride of the Marines," we showed what to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded American servicemen who come back from the war. We'll see how in many ways it was far more difficult for those struggling for the war to adapt to a peacetime America when they left something like in Al Schmid behind the battlefield. Al's struggle with his personal demons was much tougher than the Japanese he fought for as they were part of him and thus had to fight to overcome and eventually defeat them. Despite the help he received from both nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth as well as his naval doctor - who has a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck - it was still up to Al to overcome the fear he was facing. Fear like him and only he had to fight and overcome as he told everyone in the movie, all alone.
