It's about a crazy scientist who creates half a shark - half man writes critter on an unknown island, then calls all his old business and academic friends to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them ! Lots of bad GCI, tummy plots and babes sweat in tight T-shirts follows. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this spice up stuff with a little humor (I guarantee the people who made this had tongues firmly planted in the cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. But let's mention these sexy babes - more hot babes, in tight T-shirts, sweat a lot. One is in her underpants at the beginning, another at the end. Thank you, decision makers of bad movies! The plot is full of greasy stuff, a guy runs up into a jeep, slams it right into a tree and then offers to fly everyone from the island into a helicopter. Yes, yes, how do we think about it for a while? We'll come back to you. Sharkman is fun - either awful CGI or a straight comic guy in a rubber boot. The mad scientist gives quite a good performance; He is evil, it's his motivation, he makes no excuses. All in all, if you want a silly, fun B-movie, you have to do the job.
