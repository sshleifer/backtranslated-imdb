Interesting mix of comments that it would be difficult to add anything constructive to. But I will try. This was a very good action movie with some nice pieces. You should note that I have entered the genre. I didn't sneak about the lack of characterization, and I didn't tell the actor. Enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action movie. I could go on, but I made my comment.
