I saw this movie in a very strange way - I had put it on my Netflix list and couldn't remember why (except for what I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening credits, I couldn't even remember who had corrected it. <br /> <br /> When my wife and I looked at it, I turned to her for 45 minutes and said, "You know, I want to decide I hate this movie, but something it just won't let I stop seeing it. "Then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that is really electrifying in the actors' notions. <br /> <br /> It was only as the final credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought - wow. I'm surprised that Lumet looked at what really was a dirty, petty little story of really bad, broken people. But it's a testament to his talent that I became so busy when I didn't even know it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good at this movie. Like scary good. Set this up for Capote and I would argue that Oscar should have been to this movie instead. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the narrative special feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about making the movie - it's entertaining and educational, with Hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule to work with actors - kiss their donkeys all the time! <br /> <br /> There are many violent melodramatic films out there that are empty digits when all is said and done. And there's an element of it in this movie - that the actors fill the air with sulfur-containing blasts of emotion, and when the smoke clears, there's nothing left. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet has given us the Network and Twelve Angry Men movies, each of which has been enhanced in its own way to the movie's highest echoes. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at that level. But there is something about what dwells. And maybe that's enough. My last comment is about the comments - if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here at IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and It is a pretty good indication that there is something special about this movie.
