OLIVER TWIST should have controversy and success after that after Dickens published it in 1837. His image of life in the city's ghettos was somewhat shocking and new, and his portrayal of the novel's key figures includes criminals was another innovation. /> <br /> One day he went to London and passed a young woman he had been kind to. He said hello, but she was pretty stiff with him. He couldn't understand this. A few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to disturb her. "Well, if you should know, I didn't like your last novel." "Really, everyone else thinks a lot about it." He was confused: "What's wrong with that?" "Oh, Charles," she said, "I'm Jewish. How could you make such a character as Fagin?" He didn't expect this to be: "Well ... you know then in last year by Ikey Solomon, the thief's he is a model for Fagin, and he was Jewish." <br /> <br /> Dickens didn't find it settling things. "Yes," she replied, "He got what he deserved. But Charles, they did not call him" Solomon the Jew "as you call Fagin" Jew "! In addition, Salomon did not plan a murder. Dickens had to admit that he might have been carried away. He left thinking about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was released in several editions. Dickens tried to improve Fagin a little. Then he got an idea. He reworked the chapter called "Fagin's Last Night Alive", which showed fear in the man as he faced hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He let his female friend know about his willingness to change Fagin. Some time later, she met her in a friend's house. She looked at him as if he were crazy. "Don't you like the changes?" He asked. "Charles, what's changing - he's still a hostile villain called" the Jew "!" She answered. "Yes, I kept them in, but didn't you see how scared he was in the death row in the prison." The young woman had noticed this, but felt that he was so spoiled that he was so happy to suffer such fears. "Ah ... then I was right about it ... and did you see the little details I added?" He asked. "What details?" She answered. "When you first see Fagin now, he makes food himself ... you read it?" Dickens looked at her and waited for a sign of recognition. Instead, the lady looked confused. "I read he was at the fireplace, but I must have skimmed the passage." Dickens smiled as if he were brilliant: "He makes a pork sausage for his dinner." "What!" She exclaimed. "He eats pork, my dear ... see - he's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head, and left his friend's house to his dismay. She didn't speak to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never really shook his own bigotries, but the situation led to a partial attempt to change into his latest completed novel. In our MUTUAL FRIEND (1865), he has a minor character, Mr Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to gather high rents from poor tenants. The owner expects Mr Riah to be blamed for being Jewish. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good to be incredible. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action, he would probably chase him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> The anti-Semitic image of Fagin Lingers to this day. It's a goal for Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it. But by presenting the story of film, it still creates problems for scriptwriters and directors: how can a film-making of a worthy novel be made after the Holocaust without inflaming bigotry? David Lean showed how by having Alec Guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel, made it even better because of a rewrite in the original musical script. <br /> <br /> OLIVER had been made a West End musical hit in the mid-1960s and then taken to Broadway, where it was again a hit. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart, including "Food Glorious Food", "I review the situation", "Consider yourself", "Boy for Sale", "Who will buy", "as long as he needs me" deserved it is success. Reed did well in his casting roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There were no great musical successes in Hollywood in a decade - the last musical to win the best picture Oscar was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how to handle the eternal caricature problem? Well in the musical Fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder that is committed. Even after Lean showed, Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is too old to rely on this kind of chance life. Although he loses his treasures (the stolen things he held because he knew their value and admired their beauty), he decides he can reform. He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his friend could have), but a modern audience surely accepts it as appropriate.
