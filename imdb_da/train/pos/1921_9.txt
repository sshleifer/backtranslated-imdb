ABC has done more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to participate in the cast of this show. Initially, the show was visible and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three children are really a solid professional cast. The hour lesson after John's death in fact hit me home. I lost my father at age 17 and could sympathize and understand their pain and pain. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve it as John's last wish. This show is matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
