Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not predatory or boring. It just never gets old, even though I've seen it about 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to his eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few really sympathetic roles, is a pleasure. The children are, as Grandma says, more like "dressed midgets" than children, but it only makes them more fun to see. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and spectacular. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would all be "up" for this movie.
