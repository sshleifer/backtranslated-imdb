This film is about a side of Ireland, which the Americans do not normally see, the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the "friendliest race in the world". The film, by recording Fethard's old enough to remember the events, is quite accurate (though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action). <Br /> <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland when it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * organized vetos of minorities (before Protestants were the Jews) . <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
