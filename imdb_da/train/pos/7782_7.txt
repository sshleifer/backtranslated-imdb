the photography was beautiful, but I had difficulty understanding what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... the 2 goldfish - do they mean anything in Thai culture? There is not much plot that does not happen much and it just goes together. no real start, no real middle and no real end. It was hard to get into the characters that you never felt you got to know them ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real. The movement felt chaotic and uneven. I don't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve. Maybe if I was Thai it would be more sensible ...
