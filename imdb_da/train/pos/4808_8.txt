The young VICTORIA is an elegant costumed and reproduced part of history that enjoys some fine settings, solid direction of Jean-Marc Vall√©e by stalwart Julian Fellowes's version of the youthful lass to become England's longest reigning monarch - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by his mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to be drawing and getting lost in the many costumes and landscapes variations. But when Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes in the age and pours of Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), movies are flourishing. Blunt is a strong actress and finds the delicate line between girlish dismay and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those in court who will seek control of the "dragon" - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures in her role as queen, her eye is on the burgeoning German prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in memory of all is matched with the notion of affiliation of royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much because of to Albert's sensitivity. The film takes us to the birth of their first nine children and ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's impact on the various royalties across Europe! It gives an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if it does not carry epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
