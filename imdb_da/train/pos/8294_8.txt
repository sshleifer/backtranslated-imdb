This movie has good fighting scenes. Now it is true that the play is a little rough. But if I wanted to watch a movie based on acting, I would see a cheesy movie as American beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying, the air threw like so many movies around now that is more than killing the matrix. Then see this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the child shows the circuits, and another cast member of that show has a small role in this movie. But hey fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** s his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit thrown and admire.
