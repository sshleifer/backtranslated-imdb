Firstly, no one can understand why this film is rated so badly. Not only is this the first real horrible movie since I have had very long boils with decades of experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides (ghost trains) as a child. Secondly, the greatest actress Cheri Christian has a face that lets you hope she will become the leading actress in larger images of the future. Third, this woman is incredibly beautiful that I suggest that the directors step down to all the Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and where ever the names of those precious lamps are. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> But "dark remains" are also of great metaphysical importance. They imagine that photographs show creatures of the intermediary between reality and "imagination" that are not visible to their own eyes, are not new. But I have never seen in a movie before that these creatures are visible in the photographs only for certain people and only at certain times. This means that the image is not only an iconic image of reality (whereby reality becomes a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as the "real" reality channel. Being a character means changing the image that it affects the photographed objects, ie. the character behaves like an object. Now, in our normal world of perception, it is common for objects to change characters. Eg. If someone grows a bird, his image will show him beard, not outside, as it did before. But the opposite will be the shift of objects with signs meaning that the beard is primarily when the beard grows on the man. This is very simply expressed, the case of images taken by the protagonist of the prison in this film. This is new and we need to be grateful for everything new in horror movies that usually just repeats and reorganizes effects and features that are already known, mainly since the quiet time.
