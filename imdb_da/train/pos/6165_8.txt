Yes, some plots are a bit difficult to follow, and the bill tends to be fierce, but it is actually an exciting show that I am not trying to miss. A large majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite exciting, and the play is pretty good, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit that I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a little pity that the program is now after the water head when I found it easier to see when it was at 8 am. Anyway, why I like The Bill is because it's not only exciting, but the cliffhangers at the end make the next episode unmissable. It is true that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that is not trying to take it seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
