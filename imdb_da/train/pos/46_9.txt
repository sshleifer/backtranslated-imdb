Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time, picked it up one night, previously seen on Blockbuster and absolutely loved it, I have shown it to 4 people so far, and they also enjoyed it . Avoid all Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor", this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail upside down to deal with the aftermath of traumatic situations. After a high school, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) take on an unlikely bond. Alicia, the girl with the stone heart, the bitch who has a pessimistic attitude to life, helps Deanna overcome the questions of life and death and live in the aftermath. Meanwhile, Deanna is trying to help Alicia see some of the softness and light of the world again. Not to stress the shocking event of the play, but on the interpersonal relationships among those who survived, this film sets apart. Despite the low budget and short film time, this movie is far from cheesy. Ryan pays respect for a situation he has never endured and tries to dive into the human psyche. With an amazing up and coming actor, Philipps, adding the necessary drama to the dialogue and overall feel for the movie, Christensen helps balance the "dumb and gloom" that this movie may have. Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you enjoy the subject of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also propose the documentary film "It's a Girls World" published by CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social bullying, comparing and contrasting two groups of one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied.
