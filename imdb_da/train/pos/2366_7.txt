This movie (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And that was a good introduction. Though I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are BIG! There are also many of them. The recruitment struggle at Peacekeepers HQ is particularly good. There's just something about a single guy who beats crap out of a lot of people who are really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this suit her (but others don't). Matthias Hues also did a good job as always. He is a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
