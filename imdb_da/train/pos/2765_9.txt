It is the French and the Belgians who do what they do best. It is quirky, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally challenging storytelling. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a Down's Syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, just someone. This is not done in a discouraging way, but with a great sense of fun and also honesty. George's interplay with corporate management guru, Harry is dazzlingly handled - switching from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease. On the eighth day, similar Hollywood ticket as Barry Levinson's Oscar winning Rain Man or Robert Zemecki's Forrest Gump puts a good and really in the shadow. At times, it evokes the humor of Milos Forman's One Flew Over GÃ¸gens Nest with the nuances of Dennis Potter thrown into the good sense. As the emotionally blunt and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance. But it is matched by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable sets of pieces - the shoe store scene, car showroom scene, Georges dance to the Genesis 'Jesus He Knows Me', conference scene, fireworks scene. If you haven't seen it, there is only one thing to do. Just rent it or participate in a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you lacked. Better still, buy this movie. Absolute genius .....
