As someone old enough knows, South Africa suffered for a long time under the fake, racist repression of apartheid, which completely suppressed the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the murder, reporter Donald Woods tried to get Biko's message out to the world. In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) turns to Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumpet charges. When Woods tries to spread Biko's words, he and his family begin to live under attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene-gut-wrenchingly show police shoot at protesters. As one of two films (along with "A World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out as possibly the best ever work for everyone involved.
