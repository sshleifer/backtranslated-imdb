Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. Since then I have seen countless times, and I never get tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with it (Colorado, I know would be jealous), but the story is original, and I liked how it used the small town people as the hero. There hasn't been a movie I can compare this too. John Lithgow plays a clever villain, but I love how he is out of his element - he has to follow Tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. This is an action movie at its best. I don't think I want to see someone else who is so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You don't need 50,000 laps fired to qualify as an action movie. It's just keeping you imprisoned, not shell-shocked.
