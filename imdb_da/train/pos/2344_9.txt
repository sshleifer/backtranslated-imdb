I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I was curious about the program from the advertisements that were sent, which gave a glimpse of the premise of the show. I was skeptical of it first, especially after the final of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I saw the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it was the subject of death and presented in a way that was tasteful without being sick. The characters were engaging, and I like the idea of ​​Ned that the protagonist is unable to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most characters long for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian yearn for their niece Chuck and Emerson always yearn for the monetary rewards of the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the figures are picture perfect and trustworthy. I like how Emerson, who is black, plays the rest of the characters as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual adventure is one of the most valuable types of entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and probably as-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wanted the authors to come back to work so the show can continue to evolve.
