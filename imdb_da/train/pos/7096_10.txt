I had the privilege to watch this movie on a preview screen many years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted with a camera crew member from a local TV station looking for comments on the movie. At that time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "Awesome. Just awesome." I like to think that I can formulate a little better than that, but at that time I was unable to do it. The story is exciting and thought-provoking, and the play is first rate from all the main characters. This movie was the first that Terry Gilliam figured he didn't have a hand in the credit for. Back with Universal after his long, hard fight with them over "Brazil," Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the "last cut". Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is like a beautifully crafted painting that has been carefully built with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such a person should be incomplete in his attempt to convey a concept. Unfortunately, such arrangements still have limitations. The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this movie is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the box. It contains, among other things, a director / producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90-minute documentary on the production of the film called "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys". It tells of some of the creative pitfalls of filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screens were poorly tested and hit the team with feelings of self-confidence and despair. Fortunately, they all decided to change very little about the movie and release it to a huge success. <br /> <br />
