Branagh and Fishburne deliver outstanding performances in this version of Shakespeare Classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I have seen the character played in movies or on stage. Some may say that this movie is too iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in film history ironic, delivers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance of Moor of Venice can be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The one problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Desdemona character is far less depth than she has in the game. In this movie, she can't be added either. One of Branagh's worst cuts in this movie was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second action. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this movie. There were a number of attractions that damaged the integrity of this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you haven't read the game or seen a movie version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly exciting. The action is, as previously mentioned, very good. If some important scenes had been added, and the character of Desdemona was a little bit longer, it would be a good movie. As it stands, it is still an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
