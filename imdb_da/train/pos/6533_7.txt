I have to say that this was not very exciting, but talk about fashion and strange ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's great! I really liked that part of the movie ... However, Corky (Josh Flitter) is extremely funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her for how she has Treated him ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is fashionable and disguise. In any case, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? She becomes good at this difficult detective work.
