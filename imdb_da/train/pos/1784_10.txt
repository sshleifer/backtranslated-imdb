Evening is an entertaining movie with a certain depth. All actors and actresses are in spectacular performances. With the huge cast, one expects starring, but in this movie expectations are exceeded. You can relate to personalities and situations in your own family. As you look at the interaction between family members, you are immediately reminded of your own family memories. This is one of the few films that inspire reading the book. Normally, it is the reverse; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular, like the soundtrack. Any car buffer will enjoy the seemingly professionally restored period cars. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend the evening. See what you want to enjoy.
