A rather memorable movie of the animal's killing peoples that are specifically similar to "Willard" as it is an aging character actor (in this case, a step down to the level of Les Tremayne, which puts in the only prominent achievement I have seen him give) a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to settle for those who have wronged him. Yes, it is one of those films where virtually everyone is despicable so you will cheer when they die and really the choice of actors, places, etc. Could not be better to give the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender" and he is definitely the most interesting thing about the movie: an old snake collector, obsessed with John Philip Souza's music. When the local preacher cuddles down on his practice of gathering small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus disturbing his ritual Wednesday night concert) he goes on rampage in the process creating a memorable pile of clunkers under the rock where he dumps the wrecks after the disposal of their unfortunate owners. An entertaining game you can play while watching "Snakes" is to place bets on which cars will land furthest down the cliff. All in all, very cheap and useful, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kind of movies.
