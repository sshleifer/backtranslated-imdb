I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it then and I just caught it in August 2005 at a Canadian station, but it's still good. The only thing I regret is that I can't find the soundtrack or DVD in the stores ... someone usually sheds light or I have to order it from some overpriced internet companies. But coming back to the movie, the music is up to date, Hazel / Kate had something to say about the 80s in Britain. It was actually the same decade that I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons that you were "Thatcher" and what she did in the country at that time. Please if you get the chance to watch this movie, you will not be sorry!
