All reviews here on how much ZP lacks plot, the play is wood, orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point. Let's be honest. This is a movie made in the heady times of the late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It's a movie to be seen while you're H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance. Find a kind of tender and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. Seriously, these sober and sober reviews of the ZP misses the point. You can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame. <br /> <br /> Until you've seen this movie on the big screen (which I have been fortunate to have done three times in the 1990s when the ZP was quite rare) and you have no idea what this movie is is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on not seeing it drunk, you can at least appreciate the end when the shed blows up to the Soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful recycling of "Careful With That Ax, Eugene". "Get in number 51, your time is up."
