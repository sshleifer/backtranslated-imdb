If you lived through the 60's, this movie can sometimes be painful and sometimes quite joyful. That's all there, but the little print in counter culture tabloids widespread at that time. These are the roots of a social revolution that still plays out: "Don't talk too fast, because the wheel is still spinning, for the times they are a-changin". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and it is dissemination at that time, it alone played a huge hand in the development of intelligentsia that affects engineers, researchers, and helps with hyper-development of computer-related activities. A greeting to the filmmakers from someone who was there - you've got the era better than I've seen before.
