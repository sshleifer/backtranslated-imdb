Every country that has a movie film industry has a bit of sane (and maybe a crazy) artist who produces movies that you can only fully understand when you are part of that country. I think the Dog Stage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, weird, hateful. But they still have enough money to afford tuned cars and big houses. And they certainly do many strange things here that may seem to them 'normal' because they do it throughout their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now easily follow the movie and become disgusted or fascinated and see a fine piece of Austrian art film. <br /> <br /> However, if you live here and you know the people, you see the signs in the Dog Stage as the community tumor. A society that goes crazy more and more from day to day creates their own rules that no one else can understand, hollow the social system from within. And you see the people. Sitting in the park, standing in the opposite street corner, cows in the same line. Maybe you will meet them in a bar or a disco you can visit. Maybe you work with them yourself in your job or they live next to your house. You start hating them without knowing exactly why. You will try to get away - but you can't. Maybe you will end up like them. But it seems normal for you because you do it throughout your life now ... Life is not that bright, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people ... but some are also ugly. There are many hard-working people trying their best ... but there is also something to drive on the back of others and destroy everything the people of Austria have built up so far. A very pessimistic film.
