I strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding Jim Belush's talent. I happen to like Belushi a lot. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he first came on stage, because I was such a big fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a screen color that has made him very far - and he has developed well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his previous films - his weight is a giveaway, it's not true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it touches and heartwarming, so if you are in cargo, explosions and free sex, then you might pass it on - it's a hot movie of three lost suns that find each other. Don't forget me, I'm all for the three above mentioned keys for a successful movie, but I also like a good and solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And while Belushi and Kelly Lynch are providing great performances, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - which is quite sweet. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for losing the ball (agent? parents? self?) must be shot. You couldn't ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and nothing has been heard from her since. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
