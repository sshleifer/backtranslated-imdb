I went to see Fever Pitch with my mother and I can say we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy where someone hurts for the other, and blah blah ... You weren't expecting the climatic first kiss or eventually getting together. It was more true because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie is about to come together. People could actually relate to the movie because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
