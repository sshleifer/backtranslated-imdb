........... as I was when I watched this movie) I will never see this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we had read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the Woman in Black came through the window and floated over Kidd's bed, but just before there was anything that also scared us, which was when Kidd found the toy soldier under his cushion and he hears a child's voice say "It's for you". That scene still drives me to this day, almost 7 years after I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're scared, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
