I enjoyed it. Generally, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for pleasure, but when I feel overloaded or really mind-dead, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex made it possible for me to do so. That makes it a success in my eyes! I didn't even go away to do anything else while it was running. Whether it was classified as "good" or not, it doesn't really mean to me. And no, I'm not a young. I'm also not a moron.
