I found this to be a surprisingly light hand touch on a 1950s culture-clash movie. John Wayne would hardly be a first choice as a cultural attache, being so diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harrods. But this time he was back to play a role that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he did his job in style. The Duke was a guy who could really do good. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his significant presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he could not dominate this movie. Many of his good intentions came to a body. He had authority over no one, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to which he was the barbarian. The story of American attempts to curry favor with an isolationist Japan was a political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather fighting. I cannot comment on the accuracy of its research, but the strange culture of Eastern culture for Western sensibilities was well demonstrated. There was a great minutie-choreographed ceremony with what looked like this observer as authentic costumes and props. The set pieces were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought had been applied to it. <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie to become a political or flag-waving effort. Scripture was good without being too good. There was a great Japanese dialogue, but the long periods of translation did not disturb the story. It was nice to see lots of real orientations on the set. Whether they were Japanese, I couldn't say it. But still they saw part. At least the wires were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians, as opposed to other efforts like 'Blood Alley' (yes, I know they were Chinese) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or even 'The King And I' . /> <br /> Frankly, I enjoyed it more than any of the other movies. The script was better for a start. I never liked the songs in 'The King And I' and was not impressed by the heavy-duty anti-communist subtitles of 'Blood Alley'. I confess that I have never seen this work before and found it compared very positively with many of The Duke's more popular excursions. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
