As the jacket proclaims, this movie is "Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited", and yes, it is fascinatingly beautiful. The timelessness we perceive in the stump and in the incessant ebb and flow of water hits the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands, so in their much ephemeral they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in - or in Matthew Arnold's words from "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! You hear the grid roar of the pebbles, as the waves retreat and fling at their return to the high string, start and stop, and then start again, with the slowing cadence slowly and bring in the eternal note. At the end of the film, Goldsworthy says "Words do their job, but what I do here says a lot more." As a wordmaker myself, I do not take offense, and I do not think in a moment that the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition, which Goldsworthy carefully and intuitively creates, is more than just words can say . <br /> <br /> On another point, he says, "What's going to be ... and what's not." That's his theme. I think artists once in the twentieth century became very aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vastness of the cosmic era; and then they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral. The idea was that by emphasizing how short-lived there are even the most powerful works of human beings, a sense of art's timelessness will be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the efficiency of Goldsworthy's work is in this kind of expression. He puts exactly a form of straw or leaves, where the tide will reach it, or place it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process both the composition and its ephemeral are fused. <br /> <br /> Both the temporary and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place in it. And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed lies within what is natural. Thus, the stone walls and stone walls, which the Goldsworthy constructs are silent and firm, but we know they are not monuments for eternity, but will remain indefinitely and then disappear and return to a state that resembles what existed before we came together. <br /> <br /> This is art that art must be, as opposed to spiritual. In a way, Goldsworthy's work is an unarticulated understanding. It is an experience that is solely of time and form. In his way, "his work" responds to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias" by saying, even though the tide washes away the work, and even as the river disappears, the expression still lives because of our experience of it. In the same way you think of Tibetan sand paintings, so carefully composed and measured, and since they are so beautiful and valuable, they are given to the wind, so we may know that everything is flux. <br /> <br /> But in the modern world, these works of art are changing in pictures and videos. Goldsworthy is a successful photographer (necessarily I would say) and all his works, even the unsuccessful ones he tells us are photographed so he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has does not. <br /> <br /> This film production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with Fred Frith's beautiful and appropriate haunting music must not be missed. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
