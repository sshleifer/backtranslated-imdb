I watched this movie about a year ago and found it to be quite Laugh-Out-Loud fun. A real winner, in my mind. It was underlined by a stupid comedy, but actually also had a real plot. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, actually. It had a couple of serious moments that were smeared between hilarity. When Stiller shot Black's horse, a normal sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics. You can actually find common ground there, since I'm sure many people have done something they don't want a friend to find out about for your friendship to end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how much people did not like this movie, I was completely dumbfounded. The horrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about public health on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for the rent. = D
