"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that goes to great lengths and lengths to faithfully recreate the H. G. Wells classic book. Hines succeed in doing so. Me and those who watched their movie with me appreciated that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood ticket that comes out every year, for example. The Spielberg version with Tom Cruise, which only had the slightest resemblance to the book. It is clear that everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Those who imagine themselves as amateur critics only look at criticizing everything they can. Others consider a movie on important bases as being entertained, and therefore most people never agree with the "critics". We enjoyed the effort, Mr Hines believed in H.G. Well's classic novel, and we found it very entertaining. This made it easy to ignore what the "critics" perceive as missing.
