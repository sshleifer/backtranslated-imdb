until HBO started recovering this month. I remember playing loudly in the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room. If I see that it's on, I'll see it. There is no doubt. This is so much more entertaining for me than other more popular spoofs like Airplane! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "Sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! She could blow anytime!" put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg hasn't been so much fun since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. everyone turns in amazing performances as expected. I started giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of movie it should be, there is not one thing I would change or improve. So 10 is it. I'm going to get this on DVD, that's just all there is to it.
