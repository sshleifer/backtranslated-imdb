Cinderella is a beautiful movie with naturally beautiful songs. In fact, it is one of the best films from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are amazingly decorated. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's stressers and her founder, Cinderella's darkness. The mice are fun and cute. <br /> <br /> I think they changed the story a bit, but I think it's for the best. It's such a nice movie, and I don't think anyone could resist it deeply. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney movie. But it's certainly a true classic.
