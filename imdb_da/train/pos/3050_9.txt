This is simply the funniest movie I've seen for a long time. The bad plays, bad scripts, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself crazy about laughter. So it won't win an Oscar, but if you 'I have beer and friends around, then you can't go wrong.
