PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If Loving Cinema turns me into a pervert, be it! <br /> <br /> If you're a true 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you can't get enough of film-making movies, and I don't necessarily mean that the dry documentary knows and then. I mean a total discourse about the movie viewing experience. If so, I've got a lulu for a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph, if you wondered), you have noticed that the philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek gives his cinema analysis with some impressive (and often outrageous) record everything from it silent era of Chaplin through the modern age of Wachowski Brothers, analyzing, probing, and pontificating on the psychosocial underpinning, socio-economic, political, and, of course, indisputable magic in the film's experience with its unimaginable, determined and almost frenetic papers. Going from explaining how The Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing, but then suggesting the same about every Marx Brother in barely one Battles is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't know who Zizek was ?? he looks like a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? With his song and passion, the host comes over as a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes puts Zizek smartly into several of the movie clip's backgrounds that are pervaded throughout for a humorous tone, but still lets ranting and raving continue full throttle, pausing for argument in three actions that covers the film's spectrum such as Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and movies as diverse as the WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone and if a man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss the movie's themes ?? even though they are freudian / jungian for a mistake ?? so i say this collection of movie theory is worth seeing. Find it out now if you can before it comes to home video; It's the only way to appreciate it.
