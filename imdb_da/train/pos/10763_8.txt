I must admit that I was very skeptical of this documentary. I expected to be the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe do not like much. I was mistaken. This is not propaganda, it is actually hardly political at all. It depicts the events of 9/11 through the eyes of the firefighters, who were called to the scene right after the aircraft crashed. It is a wonderful conscience that this documentary was filmed at all! This movie was originally shot as a documnetary about a rookie NY firefighter being "a man". We can only thank the filmmakers that they continued their work during the terrible trial that faced them. <br /> <br /> A good job. Absolutely fantastic material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Regards,
