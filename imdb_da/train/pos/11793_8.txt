I see the series back to the back as soon as possible. I'm trying to see all things Star Trek. This is month 3, and I'm now in season 3 in TNG, and I've already been through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first recap episode in the TNG series. After just seeing they showed, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them resumed because the movie looked better. Season 1 always seemed really dark and ugly to me - and the actors as stupid as they didn't fit into their own skins. <br /> <br /> The view is basically made only of the greatest hits of the happiest and mournful moments in the life of the rich at the business until that point. The Holo Deck Data and Riker scene is a classic moment for new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority as the first officer and Riker beats the live CRAP out of the Klingon. Then his admiral kicks a $$ but good. This whole episode is a hello of a reminder that there have been a lot of crazy, big things already in just 2 seasons with 5 more going and a handful of movies! At this point in the series, they really begin to develop the feelings that link Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Until this point they have mentioned fact, but they have not yet exploited it. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relationships with Riker and also remains deeply close to an emotional. This episode further shows that there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> Here's the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi City This item in the series, the production value is faster, and Star Trek TNG gets into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to stay. Seeing this again as an adult I now see what GREAT ACTORS Star Trek Universe provides. They really need to make a new ST show after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would also have been good.
