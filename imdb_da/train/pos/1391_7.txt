Given that it was made on a low budget, the DAYS ENDED managed to get the most out of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family who are entering their sun-power home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find the garbage - by motorcycle vandals, the. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) is starting to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid characters, etc. And only recently has the light of a star explosion caused extremely unusual auras that appear in the desert sky. The family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, thus find themselves face to face with alien alien forces who have put them in a time and space chain. Blend in elements from 2001: ET SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE THIRD CHILD PICTURES is the day that ends, despite its obvious mistakes and bumpy action still interesting because of David Allen's outstanding special effects. The desert setting is very suitable for the movie's close meetings; And while the movie can't really be compared to either Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, DAYS ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS courses. I give the honor to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least to try - and on that basis I give the DAY ENDED a 7 out of 10.
