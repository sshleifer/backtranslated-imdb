To be honest, I didn't like so much this movie when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I haven't seen it in a theater. Big mistake! Because # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is cinematography. Try to watch this movie on the biggest TV and a good sound system. The music is good and sets the film to a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy knows about action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss goodbye etc. And this is especially good in this movie. The special effect is great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the movie to come back successfully. Still good to see him!
