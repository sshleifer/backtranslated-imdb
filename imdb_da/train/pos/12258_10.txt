Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely pleasant story at worst, and this production of history is the best I have ever seen. Cake Beckinsales Emma is indescribable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good manuscript and excellent film) is able to bring out the comedy effectively, failing to make Emma sympathetic. Paltrow is not supported by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for that part (and I believe in the era) and she looks positively ill in emperor dresses. Kate Beckinsale, by contrast, handles the comedy effortlessly and can still show what Mr Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is an excellent Mr Knightly with the right mix of beautiful looks, an appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentleman behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors, and the production as a whole is quite lovely.
