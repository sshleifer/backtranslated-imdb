Let me first say that the director has a wonderful use of titles in his depictions. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie, but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan blends into this character so well that it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy who played bond. It also shows his reach and depth as an actor. It's a bit of an indie flick and was really nice to watch especially with all the regular movies that flood the movies at this time of year. I found the signs to be well designed. The twist in the middle felt I was particularly good. I also liked how the characters come out realistically. So many times we have in movies these caricatures of people who are not really characters but walking stereotypes ... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie, but I think it is more visible and a better movie together ...
