I used to write comments on IMDb, but I no longer do that. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and consequently subjectivity has destroyed scores. What do I mean? That anyone who is not particularly fond of movies and has no expertise on the subject sees something shit (or the other way around), and if he likes it, he delivers a 10 and if he doesn't go for a 1. This can Of course, do not measure anything correctly. Now for the movie. I really regret ever having delivered some 10's to a few few movies, because then I have to score this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I don't expect to see ever again in my entire life in another movie. It's simply fascinating, and it's not just a way of saying; It really is. The last 25 minutes have a burden of energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the star guys - it's really ... there is no possible fight. I don't like movies, rarely would I find any meaning in it, but one is the kind of movie you have to buy and keep and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times this year. I have no more to say. This is a real, goal 10 for me.
