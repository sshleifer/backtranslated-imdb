Despite what others had said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie all the time. I don't know how long I was waiting to see it, but when I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's strange, but it just gives it more of an exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of Gackt's and Hede's first films. They haven't done much at all, maybe 3 or 4 peaks each. Then give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best either. I think they throw some odd situations in there, but I look over it to find the best points in this movie, they showed feelings and whatnot. Therefore, I have given and always have to give this film a 10 out of 10.
