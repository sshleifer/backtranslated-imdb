There are many police dramas rounds. I'm not sure why. It is enough to do with the old basic theme of good against evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult dedication of Anne, a raw recruitment, to a police station stationed in the Baltic area. No attempt has been made to glamorize the police. They are really down to earth, hard at times and unforgiving, Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Unlike all rules, she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other surveys. <br /> <br /> This is not a comfortable movie. Not one to relax. There is not much sense of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family breakdowns, and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. As days go by, Anne becomes more involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the movie is the one provided by the character Benny, a 12 year old from a broken family. Anne has her own way to patch up. She turns a blind eye to Benny's store lift and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. It asked me if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs. The film makes it clear that she desperately needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well thrown, but not my idea of ​​an evening's entertainment,
