This is an extremely powerful based on a true story movie that can be staggering to watch. I say it because how brutal a mocking press can be for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received great recognition for her performance as this movie came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was a little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned so well, I had trouble understanding her in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, I can only say that this movie will carry you out emotionally.
