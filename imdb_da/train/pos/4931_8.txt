When the plague breaks out in New Orleans, it is Richard Widmark for rescue in "Panic in the Streets", one of the lesser-known films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace alive, and there are plenty of amazing touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who play their wife and stage in the police station, show family life and work life and the relationship between average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to life and relationships of life, portrayed by a threatening Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting pictures - Palance has a few scenes with actors that seem to come up to their knees in height. The action is fantastic and the dialogue sharp, if the story is not entirely up to direction and ideas. It has a couple of dubious aspects that the viewer looks easy. Aside it is worth seeing. Kazan was a master director.
