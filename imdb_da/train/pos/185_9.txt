I finally bought and added to my collection a copy of "Show People". I cannot comment more than what previous viewers have indicated and the characters, plot and overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. When you see the cameo, the look of so many M-G-M silent stars is worth seeing in itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays himself and faces playing the movie's main character, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it is something that comes with "I don't think I like her!" Pop the corn, pop in the ribbon and get ready to go back more than three-quarters of a century in the film-making story. Enjoy!
