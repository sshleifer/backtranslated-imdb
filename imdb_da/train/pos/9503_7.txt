a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living a delapsed building and interacting with a solid cast of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the wealthy cigar man. The photography of the river is wonderful, like the interior decoration. If you like the decoration of Banana Republic shops, this is a must.
