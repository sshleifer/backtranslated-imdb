Ms. Patty Duke's story of her life and fighting with manic depression was like my life fight. I looked myself like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to the sexual assault that we both endured as children. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie as it first premiered in 1990, and I've loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie. Don't worry about whether it showed her prizes or what they were for. That's not the problem here. The question is, how did Mrs. Duke have a disease and struggle to survive and overcome it. Mrs. Duke has a lot to be proud of in her performance with her struggle to survive a disease that often leaves many victims without hope. Unless a person has struggled with this disease personally, they do not know in hell they should live with. The movie to me was a success because it showed the real problems and how a person is depressed and manic. It was so true ... so right. It was like seeing myself up there on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could thank Mrs Patty Duke personally for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
