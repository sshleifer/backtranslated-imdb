Born Again Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in a little girl's head <br/> <br /> Revenge he would get <For The murder met him <br /> <br /> By the guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born is a very underrated classic episode that forms part of what was defined The X-Files for me before I began to see it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came, and I was much too young to see it as part of The Jersey Devil, but I remember very specifically seeing this episode as an 11 year old and totally spoiled by the scene where The guy smothered to death with the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura about it now of the scary factor that I have since grown to enjoy. It's enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot, for example why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her former life spirit really began to exact her revenge. Or whatever she did just randomly sits on a bus in the middle of the night. You would think the parents would have been worried. And maybe they were, we really don't see that part of the story. And was there with telekinesis? Apart from adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already eerie story, there really was no kind of good explanation for it. But even with its small flaws, it is in my eyes a classic episode and has little or no reason I don't like it. 10 out of 10
