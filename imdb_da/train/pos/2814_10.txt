This is the finest movie ever made to deal with the AIDS issue. It is a documentary about two men living with and dying of this disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, fun and incredibly moving. Above all, it is a wonderful true love story. Be sure to get a few hankies ready before you see this movie --- you need them. Extraordinary.
