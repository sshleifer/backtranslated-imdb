I will admit I thought this movie would not be good, but I soon changed. The movie kept you guessing which direction it goes. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a hitman who is suddenly burnt out and asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is a fantastic straight man, as his role as a gentle joke from Denver, starting an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie makes you laugh when Pierce delivers fun, a line (mostly about sex). The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially on the bullfighting scene & when Pierce sees himself as he tries to finish his last job.
