I'm not sure under what circumstances Director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is certainly interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for noir fans. Visconti blends neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. However, the film is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; The story goes at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think movie noir works better with a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep the viewer interested. In any case, as much as I like this movie and remakes, I think no one has made the final version of Cain's highly acclaimed book.
