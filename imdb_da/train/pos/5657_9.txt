I remember looking at American gothic as it was first aired. It came into my heart recently. All I could remember was that the same guy appeared in Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I don't see much TV, but I looked at American gothic, I bought the complete series on DVD this week and it's still so good As ever, this is one of the best TV shows ever, the reason I don't see much TV is because it's just some nonsense on, except Derren Brown, it's all Reality TV or Soaps that fat, Big Brother etc. I'm tired of it, I have the complete series of American gothic for $ 16.97 as the Asda website, it's the cheapest I can find it.
