My companion ordered this from a web page back and finally got to see it. It's rough. It's cheezy. It's pretty stupid ... but it's also very fun. I mean, it was the funniest thing we've seen on a movie like this page "City Of The Walking Dead" many years ago. It was like being on the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. This has all the clich√©s and tricks of these movies rolled into one, and that's nice because it's SUPPOSE to be like that. The cheeze factor is high, gore floats and laughs roll! The effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half, and the one where a guy gets his heart pushed through his chest is both good! The play goes from terrible to actually pretty good. There is not much plot, just lots of gore. This one is patterned by zombie films from Italy and Spain, I think because they sleep on the gross scene forever, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can't do anything wrong to watch this. A great way to waste a Friday night!
