A real screaming situation comedy farce in the mid-70s, this movie was a big hit for approx. 5 minutes and disappeared from the earth's surface. I am constantly amazed by some comedy films that are a great release a week and then disappear: HIGH ANXITY, THE AWAY DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DOESN'T POSSIBLE WHEN WE ARE SHOWN .......... and have no profile at all today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in when 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh about it and never ever mention it ever again. Famous for being shot at videotape and transferred to movies, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect popping farce, which The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today. If they had done so in the first place, there would be no complaints about the content and cant either. It is very fun and YES very rude and hilarious all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact, as a groovy 1976 movie with all those horror colors and clothes, it actually works better today.
