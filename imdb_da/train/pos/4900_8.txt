This is a quirky movie that the British do so well. Low budget, cameo type roles, well done. The story is a little weak, a newly widowed Judi Dench decides to round off the "blonde bombshells" a whole (almost all) girl band that performed during the London war. The obligatory son / daughter who thinks she has gone potty. looked like the way the movie lets young people see that they do not have a monopoly on emotion, love and even desire! That the "old wrinkles" can also have a good laugh. Judi Dench was awesome as always, pity we didn't do I can't see more of the other "blonde bomb shells, the end was a little rushed, I thought. I continued to think when I saw that David Jason would have made a even better Patrick than Ian Holm, although he was quite suitable as a "transvestite" drummer. All in all, a nice movie worth a night in with the girls :)
