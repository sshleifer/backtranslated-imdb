I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Guy bring the ab list (ish) film casting and turn them into such brilliant characters, he has given us a movie with a stunningly diverse story line with much back to imagination. Too many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a record ... but these are the movies that become poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
