ITALY is an amazingly complete movie for its time. Fantastic shot, with light effects really sublime, this is an early gem that clearly shows that REGINALD BARKER is a pioneer leader with a uniform position on D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince exercised over the production is difficult to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is moving a lot. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are quite relevant today. Using close-ups is excellent, and GEORGE BEBAN's powerhouse performance is electrifying. What we need now is a really good print transferred to DVD so we can really appreciate this early cinema masterpiece.
