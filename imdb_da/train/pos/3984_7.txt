As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale, this movie featuring the new Bond starring from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill) was featured. I almost knocked it off to be a bit boring, but I'm glad I'm stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a girlfriend this year. Her daughter says she might be married to her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). Having known each other only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And in his age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond ?! Yet, of course, they will keep it a secret, but May has regret and wonder if Helen will figure it out. When she does, Darren gets less stress than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to beat her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny England's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
