"Amazing Mr. Williams" the stars Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five films that year, three of which made it together! Douglas is Lt Williams, and he and his cohorts are presented with a dead body and they need to find out what really happened. Viewers will recognize his colleagues - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always played regulatory positions ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This who-dunnit has a flair of comedy to it - the police always throw jabs on each other and even Williams and his girlfriend fight orally. Some funny gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested together on a date with his girlfriend. There are many fun things in here, so get past the slow start and wait for the more fun things later. Don't want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall mostly made comedies and was reportedly engaged with Lucy at some point.
