I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version might be shortened. I'm curious about it myself, because the later parts of the movie just didn't make much sense to me even when I rewatched them. 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 too. "Poor Little Rich Girl", who was Tourneur's next film, is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous move was 84 minutes long. So I am relieved to see that I was not crazy, there must be a part of this movie that is missing and that is why the decision didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you can only see half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the truly fascinating point of view that gives us the inside of an East Coast movie study of the time. It is the earliest movie I have personally seen based on the film industry itself. The protagonist is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who later became a starring Hollywood actor and appeared in almost every Preston Sturges movie. He plays a Western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, which Warwick looks like. After the really fascinating sequences in the studio we see them on a spot where he discovers a land girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very badly. After this time, the film seems to lack big pieces in the form we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone interested in film history for the documentary, but in the form we do not like much as a movie and is not a very good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
