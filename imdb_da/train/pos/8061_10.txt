Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest in movie history. I think we can all feel "Gypo" because we have all been fighting for what is right and what has not been and has been wrong. This was one of the first art-house images published by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's films are the best here. August's amazing part was mostly overlooked; he did not receive the Oscar nomination, he rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama with thinking, philosophy, sadness, all with as little word as possible.
