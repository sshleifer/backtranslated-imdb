I can't see how this show is like OC at all. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the center centers on teenagers and their parents trying to get through life. North Shore is about a hotel staff trying to run the hotel while having a social life. Secondly, OC is located in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox make a show like one of his other shows on the same network? I think it's a good show with good actors for the most part. It has a good story and plot. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and work them out. The latest episode was surprising how the story worked. It was not predictable as most stories on most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it on the air.
