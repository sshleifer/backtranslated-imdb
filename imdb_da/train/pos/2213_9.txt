Wow this was a movie was absolutely captivating I couldn't believe I started watching so late to see it, but it came on late ounce I started to see I couldn't stop it had a wide range of very good cast members wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more well-known actors and actresses. This was more than a glimpse of the story. It was eye opening in another part of society that people do not know and may even be embarrassed to talk about. I have never heard of a book or movie about this before and it is something that black story never addresses only looks because they were privately owned and mixed, I highly recommend this movie
