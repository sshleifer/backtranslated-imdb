This is a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! An amazing time is guaranteed for everyone. The audience (feat some celebrities like Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) are as always absolutely fantastic: from small children to old campaigns of the 60s. They know the words of all the songs of the heart, and some of them cry when Paul breaks into "blackbird" "yesterday" "all my love" and all the treasures in his catalog (except John Lennon and Dylan can invoke a such repertoire?). There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> -The dual tribute to Lennon and Harrison; first "here today" performed solo (the title was included in "tug of war" 1982 and was the best track), so "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - "The long and winding road" rendition, a key moment when Paul's voice jumps as he is moved to tears by the hearts holding the members of the travel crew in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember in the early 70s when people used to despise Paul because he was not involved in politics that his ex-partner was. They had to change because Paul is a committed artist: "Fame is great because it allows charity." The film shows various aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
