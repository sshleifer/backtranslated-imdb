_Waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinal injured artfully. From the petty plagues of defective fluorescent lights that flash overhead for sexuality, masculinity and depression, the disability experience is set. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the key characters even emphasizes the complexity of the material studied - Joel, the author, Raymond, the black man with a creepy past, and Bloss, the racist biker. Initially, these men are united by nothing but the nature of their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, common experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious of the transformations is that Joel saw him originally distance from his fellow players with sunglasses, headphones, and curtains. When he comes to accept the changes that handicaps have made in his life, Joel discards these props and begins to engage in the fighting with the men with whom he shares the division. <br /> <br /> The dance mentioned in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep the head over the water; To give up the dance is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful movie on many levels and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
