If this had happened earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It is good enough as most are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this time. The situation is exceptionally exciting: the farmers in the province have two masters, a benevolent boss (once) and a philosopher-samurai who start a sort of Grange; both run by the usual local gangsters who want the crops to fail because it increases their gaming revenue and their chances of catching up in any country; their superior or strong ally is a seemingly puritanic who is dead drinking and playing, but secretly pampering his own perverted desires. (He also looks like Dracula, as the bad guys in the later Zatoichi movies tend to do more and more.) These characters have enough meaning so they deserved to be set against Zatoichi when he was originally drawn, but now he has lost many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters that the good boss and the angry sister of a man killed by Zatoichi need more time when the film is to give, so the story seems rude, as if some scenes were missing. Apart from that, the film shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a living, trustworthy and uniquely recognizable landscape (whose absence is evident in occasional episodes where director just misses it), and a technical quality that, by its very nature, spoils itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets, so their limitations do not seem to exist. And of course, there is the keynote actor whose presence, as much as his performance, does it all work. This must be one of the most durable series in film history.
