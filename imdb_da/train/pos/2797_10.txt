10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. The word Beckham struck me off, 'cos I'm a dead hard Liverpool fan, and personally think that Owen is really cool. When Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was DEAD sure I wouldn't watch the movie. <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early morning flight so I thought, "Hey, let's bite time watching this movie," because it was a late night show. <br /> <br /> What a moron I was, I should have watched this movie the day it was released, I guess using Beckham's name was drawing a public attraction (which had withdrawn in my case !!!), but then I really can't think of a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead beautiful), and Rhys-Myers did a fantastic job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, you don't like Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is FINALLY the movie for you. In fact, I'm just 29 years old, a psychiatrist of profession, but a child in heart This movie has hit "Star Wars" out of my No. 1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not so many comments on this movie of Indian Britons like me. orphan? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
