At the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot together and in the morning he wakes up with him on the bed. His future son-in-law calls him and says his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) might arrive in his apartment and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place. First, he finds her having crabs, and later he realizes in his preparation for his wedding dinner party that Becky is the guy of the guy. This is the beginning of a very fun comedy with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this movie is certainly the central trio of actresses and actresses. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly fun, have great performances. I laughed a lot after the story, but there are some scenes that are really fun. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds her paint; his imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about crab medicine; most of his neighbor's scenes, the Minister; when Karen calls the department store or when the police find a suspect to attack Paul. I could count many other scenes but better by the reader hire or buy this movie and have lots of fun. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
