When you see this again after a yearlift and remember the flop it was at its original release, I am surprised how well it has stopped. One of the reasons for its failure was that a generation just thought it was over affection, and a younger one was disappointed that it didn't show the full hippic glory. Now, it is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the dull mix of eager enthusiasm for change and lack of a clear vision for the future. The main couple are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much care of the film's perceived failure. They are ideal and perfectly convey the various contradictions and show a pure joy in lovemaking. I blame others for the overweight on the pupil revolutions at first, but have to say that from here is one of the director's most beautiful images, and he has certainly got the best out of man-made and natural landscapes. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the very explosive end.
