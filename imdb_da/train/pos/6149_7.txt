I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with great love from childhood, and it's certainly made for a curious afternoon's entertainment. Bedknobs are certainly more sensible in their complete form, the deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) link events together pretty nicely. What is a bit confusing is how the scenes have been remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack to this recording was lost or damaged, so some bright sparks at Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue. It would have been good, except that half of the casting wasn't around to do it (some for better reasons than others) and it all has a pretty scary quality for it. Some of the lip sync is pretty bad, and David Tomlinson's voice has been dubbed by a blocker that doesn't sound like David Tomlinson (there's actually a hint of German in that I think). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although 'Steps in the right direction' are still absent), and the magic moments in this movie are still shining through. And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocent at Angela Lansbury and Coos "but what about my button?"
