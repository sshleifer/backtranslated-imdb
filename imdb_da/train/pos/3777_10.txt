Anyone who doesn't believe Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the best movies that ever needs their head controlled. It somehow succeeds in being both inane and non-brainer, but also frighteningly knowledgeable and wise at the same time. One of the rare films that actually enhances the predecessor Bogus Journey can be enjoyed over and over again. Notable highlights include the duel with death and the end, which is very "emotional". Keanu will forget all that Matrix waste and come down to what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
