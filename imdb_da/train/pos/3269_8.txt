CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after she is pregnant. We then see the man in heaven giving the powers that know he was taken early and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth, but not as himself. Becoming 19 years old, seeing Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to leave college and encountering a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) as it turns out is the reincarnation of his father. The movie is a bit on the predictable side ... the story goes on all the places you expect it to be, but it's so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can't help getting wrapped in it fun. Shepherd is rarely seen on the screen for better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character players in supporting roles. A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you.
