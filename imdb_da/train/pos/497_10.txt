Call me for youth, but I really think this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely see it here. Perhaps more convincing than Voyager's Caretaker, who launched the Cpt series. Janeway, Archer's adventure is completely different, yet strangely familiar ... The music is also eye-catching. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode - and these repayments make the wait worthwhile.
