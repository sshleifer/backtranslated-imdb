A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped movie. Perhaps that is why so few have been approved by this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Smart dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes, and when the hunt came you really thirsty for it. Fanboys expects an Armageddon slide: Stay away. This is one of the more intelligent action fans. It didn't bother me even Jolie thought so little.
