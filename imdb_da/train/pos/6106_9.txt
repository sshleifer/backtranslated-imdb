When it comes to the erotic genre, I'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without coming up or looking for anything else to see. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Do Not Touch Me) instructed two very strong main actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this exciting thriller. Kira convinces as "Kim" a sweet innocent romance writer who gets caught on the web by seduction by Doug Jeffery's "The Man" a beautiful stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as an actress it gives what could have been simply another T and A depth and credibility. I think it's her best performance yet. And Julie Davis' direction is a great gift for eroticism.
