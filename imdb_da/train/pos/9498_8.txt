"Painting looks, then you remember better than you saw." Then says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed. The movie is in the great old Hollywood style with starring Ronald Colman and a bravura backing that includes Ida Lupino in his first important role, reliable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.), And a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the movie pretty much leave out that Dick will lose his sight. He is blinded by gunfire when he and childhood treasure Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later a wound while fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already dazzled by ambitions and does not reach his full potential to the point where his vision leaves him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) and his self-destruction is underway. Lupino is very strong in this role and plays very well by Colman. Her evil pies remind me of Bette Davis in human bondage. <br /> <br /> Well-behaved and well-directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
