This movie is not amazing, but it is a good and enjoyable one. It feels like an indie movie made by a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, though the director swears, the script is not written for him. And there's the little irony of the actor going to a supermarket to do research on a movie he hasn't committed to yet. I mean, he actually made the movie at last, and we see it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, yet refreshing. This is a movie that inspires the viewer to look at their own life and choose the direction to go. A bit too much weight on appearance if you ask me. Bottom line: A nice little movie, made in two weeks, with virtually two actors and a few extras, dial-driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
