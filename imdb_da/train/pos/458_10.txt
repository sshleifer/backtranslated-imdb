My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the captivating song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If anyone has the full texts, please send them. Of course a big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It is great to see a show that highlights the contribution of society, which can still be made by older people with special skills and experiences. The human interest aspect that shows interactions between the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated on par with some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
