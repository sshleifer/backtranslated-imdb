I loved this movie. Great history and actors and good movie sets. It told the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I want to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where to get the soundtrack. Apart from not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a good job. I think this is some of his best work. His previous movie was ok, but this one really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever aired. Congratulations to the producers and the authors of such great work.
