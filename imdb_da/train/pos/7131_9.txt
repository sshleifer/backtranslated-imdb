This movie for television is a brilliant one. This is probably the best and favorite role BAFTA wins John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) widow has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died, and now he has landed with an evacuation called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As he learns to know this child, he begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom becomes worried that William is not contacting him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Willaim gets her home with a loving family (or father). Seen during World War II, it's an excellent movie. It was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the national television award for most popular drama. John Thaw was number 3 on the 50's biggest stars. Very good!
