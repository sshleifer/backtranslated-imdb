I really liked this movie and went back to see it twice more within a week. <br /> <br /> Wife. Detmer nodded the performance - she was like a hungry cat on prowl, playing with her prey. She turns into anger and lust and takes a "too young" lover and crashes hundreds of her terrorist fianc√© mother's pieces of fine Chinese to the floor. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful details. Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the rooftops. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> <br /> It had a sense of 'Story of O' - that is, where people of funds spoil unhindered sexual adventure. As she walks around in the fabulous apartment in buff, she is calm - and why not, what should you relate to "Devil in the Flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a great experience!
