Although this series only lasted one season, it has stayed with me for 20 years. It was far above my all time favorite cartoon ever. I would give almost everything to get it on DVD or whatever format I can get. If you find some funds to see this series, I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent story spanning several episodes. It also made me really worried about the signs and what happened to them. The Heck character Goose actually scared me. He was just so strange at the time. Also the head of the group reminds me of a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / proprietor of the rights to the series and can have them put on DVD, please in every way !!!
