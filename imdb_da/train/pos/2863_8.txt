Although this show has been out in the air since 1973, after watching a DVD set I borrowed from our library, I felt compelled to say a little about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a little "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch this on NBC on one of They get color TV. I really enjoy the story not so much for names and dates, but how it affects us today and how so much can be so deeply based on the most inappropriate actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the world's richest cities because of the silver method, got the name from a character called "Old Virginny", who in the early days of the city stumbled out of a salon, fell and broke his whiskey bottle. Old Virginny did not want to waste the occasion, so the precious liquid sucked into the dirt, he decided to baptize the city "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claims and the area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I was just looking at an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects. Other episodes treated Mark Twain's literary ascent, while a reporter for the territorial business ... It was healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As another noted, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own true writings and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that twisted the truth was the proximity to Virginia City and Ponderosa. In fact, you have to drive from Ponderosa (all of Northern Lake Tahoe), and you have to ride his horse about 3000 meters down the Spooner Summit to the Carson Valley Desert (3,000-4,000 feet) and then another 30-40 miles to Virginia city . <br /> <br /> Needless to say Cartwrights would have some sore bags doing this regularly. But every writer should have some leeway with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss that show, even today.
