This work is less about Steve Martin's character Davis than it is about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue deployed via Davis is contemplative, contemplative, near-miss existentialism at its best. He is witty, intelligent and thought-provoking in both the dialect and the content. The authors deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The show is light, relaxed and natural; just what you would expect from "A List" actors. Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his newer Shopgirl, who guides you through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is the equal - costume - the film's conform, and as such his performance is sharp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work deals with life in every aspect. It gives a true emotional investment in its characters and gives you the feeling of hope that humanity is not doomed, in spite of everything you think deeply. Overall? This is great with a gritty moment or two and an easy natural dialogue that pulls you in and helps the audience get a great pleasure from this work. It is definitely worth your time, although it may not be everyone's best choice as Friday / Saturday evening entertainment. I really enjoyed the intelligence that was exhibited. It is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited here. Couples and friends hold detailed conversations that feel and sound honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will soon add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> It bets on a 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
