This movie has such a great feeling especially with its excellent soundtrack that coincides with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making movies and entertaining. This movie wasn't the best the first time I saw it, but after approx. 3 times I decided that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's going on in New York and evolving through his lifestyle. He discovers a delimit in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an extrovert mix of imagination. This movie was beyond my expectations and is one of Cruise's best movies ever!
