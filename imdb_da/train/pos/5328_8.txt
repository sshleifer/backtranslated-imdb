I still remember first to watch this on TV. I couldn't believe TVNZ let it go! I had to own it! A lot of humor will be lost on non-NZs, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Since the end of the Back of the Y series, Matt and Chris have gone on to bigger and better (?) things. NZ's biggest dare devil runner, Randy Campbell, has often appeared on the British television series Balls of Steel. Yeah, he still gets all his stuff up because he's too full. <br /> <br /> Also 'House Band' Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the Back of the Y team and singles like "I would give you one of my beers (but I only got 6)" and "You weren't even born in the 80s" continue their humor. <br /> <br /> The South-South-West Film Festival also featured their feature film 'The Devil Made Me Do It', which will be released early 2008 in NZ. <br /> <br /> Everything up, if you don't find these guys fun, then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
