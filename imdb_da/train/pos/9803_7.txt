This Batman movie is not as good as the Batman mask of Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero. But it's still a good handover to the Batman comics. I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The story is good, not quite as good as the other, but still pretty good, it has lots of action in it. The cartoon effects are good The voices of the actors are really good as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The bad guys are good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers like The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman Mystery of the Batwomen. So make sure you rent or buy the Batman Mystery of The Batwoman movie because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall Score: ******* out of ********* * <br /> *** out of *****
