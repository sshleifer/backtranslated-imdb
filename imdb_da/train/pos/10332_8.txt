Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​stands for trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses provide documentation - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), William's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelms formerly love Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The movie ends after the court summarizes .... <br /> <br /> The movie is told in three flashback segments, as each of the witnesses takes the stand. The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village's reaction to Anna's death (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm is accused of rape; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they are preparing to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service, where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) condemns his Nazi mission while providing for his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marja's daughter, after being shot on a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Knox is unjustified and is very convincing as a bitter, wild and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with his strength, and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This movie delivers an effective story that stays with you when it's finished.
