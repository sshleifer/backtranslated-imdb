I first see this movie almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before cable and satellite day) Matinee. I was off school with hops and I was completely wrapped in the movie. I have had it on purchased video for about 10 years and I would like a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my all-time favorite actress and I think it's a travesty that he was over so many times when the Oscar came around. I also think the queen should have ridden him as he easily did so much for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the movie changes from black and white to color and back, is well finished, and the movie features such star actors as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance by Richard Attenborough.
