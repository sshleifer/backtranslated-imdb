SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every card is a gem. While I have to say that this is certainly an inferior card compared to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, there is no way you can hate this cartoon. Of course, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are good, but some are just better than others. Well, that would fit in with "others". <br /> <br /> Here is a plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to an old frightening radio broadcast and gets scared. Jerry observes how frightened he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates frightening dilemmas for Tom, and Tom gets scared out of his wits and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it so it looks like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry did all this and chases him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid. But in the end, Jerry ends up being frightened after he sees his reflection in a milk spoon. <br /> Overall, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry out there, but it's still a fun and entertaining time. It makes me wish there were more cartoons like this. Slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but it felt like something was missing in this. It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Still, this is a good card that doesn't live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
