I saw this series when I was a child and loved the detail it went in and never forgot it. I finally bought the DVD collection and that's just how I remembered. This is just how a doco should be impartial and in fact. The movie footage is incredible and the interviews are amazing. The only other series I've found right here is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, so they can make some amazing war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Our Fathers Flags and When Trumpets Fade are some I would recommend
