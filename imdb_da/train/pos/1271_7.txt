Never having seen this movie, based on Nicholas Katzenbach's entertaining novel, and taking into account the first rate cast gathered for the production, we decided to take a look. "Just because", but not a horrible movie, takes too many freedoms with the original material that Jeb Stuart failed to fully deal with. Arne Glimcher instructed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think when a young black man is pulled to the local area for interrogation is the brutality of the police. After all, sheriff Tanny Brown and policeman Wilcox show no mercy by beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We feel horrified at what officers do for the prisoner. <br /> <br /> The scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother sent north to ask a prominent Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She's old woman is convincing enough that Armstrong takes a look at the case. He is also convinced of the youth's innocence. It's not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man earning time in the same facility as Bobby Earl, comes up to talk about how he is associated with the young girl's murder and changing the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from arriving at the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made fun of Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, gives a fine impression as the sheriff, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson are seen in the role. <br /> <br /> The movie won't disappoint even with its mistakes.
