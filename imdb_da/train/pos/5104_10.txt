This is a clever drama about the lifestyle of a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger show two very believable performances such as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance movie then you will love this movie.
