I know the movie's snobs are snarling. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> A bit thin at times, but its one-liners and the location more then make up for it. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to have fun doing his part as the ultra evil white slaves. The nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the movie that only a pro like Hurt could offer. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jake's sidekick) are a good team, though you wonder why they both sit together. But together, both Crawford and Christopher show a team that is just so funny that if you can get over yourself in a moment, you can find yourself acting like a child again in the situations and the inherent excitement they give. The delicious Karen Kopins does a good job as the Queen of Distress who is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer than her plagues. <br /> <br /> I haven't yet found a movie that is so much fun without preaching or scratching the movie by trying too hard. Not all movies should be the latest "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was an original. So let's remember that sometimes movies are fun. Not social comments or trying to swing an audience politically. But just for the pure fun to be alive and live in a time when our hero is in a celluloid dimension.
