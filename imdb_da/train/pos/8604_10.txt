I know many people don't like this movie, but I just think it's cute. There is not much I can say, but the movie is a good movie I think. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many fun lines in the movie, especially as Briggitta learns about the do's and not the community. If you like musicals, I would like to like this one!
