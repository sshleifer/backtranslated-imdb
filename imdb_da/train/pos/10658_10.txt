The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I've remembered it all these years since I couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just scared me completely. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to see as an adult. It has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally got the name and reviews on it. I enjoyed it a lot, but it gave me a scare! Jaqui
