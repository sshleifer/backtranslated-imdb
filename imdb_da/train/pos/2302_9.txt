Reese Witherspoon's first trip on the big screen was a memorable one. She looks like a fresh scrubbing face "tween" weak and tight, but undeniably Reese. <br /> <br /> I always wanted her as an actor and had no idea that she started this kid with her career, figure. I actually got Reese respect to know who she was so early on. I say it because every time I have seen her, the characters so far in every depiction seemed to have their own persona who lived with that character, quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first movie experience with Reese was Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed it was her first time up "on the bat" Not so, Well done Reese
