The movie's design seems to be alpha and omega of some of the major problems in this country (USA). We see relationships everywhere on the university setting for the film. Befittingly the obvious of student vs. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationship: male vs. female white vs. variety, and the individual vs. community. But most importantly and in direct relation to all the other relationships is the individual vs. himself. <br /> <br /> I was amazed how bilaterally a director pointed out to show the race links on campus. Most movies typically show the injustices on one side while showing the other. This film showed both sides injustice and suffering. It did not try to show how it was right, though I would say that the skin head was very cruel and vindictive (quite obviously at last). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically this injustice that somehow brings the two together for a time. Lawrence Fishburne makes an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Prophet Phipps. He crumbles the idea of ​​racial favorism and instead shows the lazy and depressed parallelism with the industrial and positive. Other stars who make this movie are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger seeking acceptance. Tyra Banks makes its film debut and shows that supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> Higher Learning gets its name to show college as more than go to class and get a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, like the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you will find "Higher Learning" relies on the important issues of many universities and even life in general. 8.10
