"Slaughter High" is a completely ridiculous slasher flick on a high school nerd Marty who gets picked all the time by some pranksters. The prank goes wrong and he ends up being burned burnt. Five years later, his tormentors all participate in a reunion of the ten of them, of course, and do and see Marty murdering them one after another.British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") cast as heroine (who dies anyway!). The play is horrible, there is no excitement at all. Lots of grotesque death scenes to satisfy gorefreaks: a guy's stomach explodes, another woman's victim literally gets acid bath, a couple having sex in bed, gets electricity, a guy is crushed by a tractor, a girl is drowned, and a doctor gets one hyperdermic needle in the eye. The killer carries a decent and pretty crazy jester mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice. But the dream final is completely pathetic. All in all, it is true that "Slaughter High" is a piece of waste, but I enjoyed it. Only for fans of really bad slasher flicks.
