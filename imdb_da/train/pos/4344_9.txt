The film comes to the excitement between a son and a father. The brilliant dialogue, lovely scenery and great plays serve as an excellent way to present onions that keep peeling back. <Br /> <br /> The core issues of parents, communication, and crew are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In fun ways the curtain is retracted, the masks get rid of and truths are exposed. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the middle of a road trip format. The background is rural New York state in the early fall, as well as the trees are changing colors. WOW!
