Wow! That kind of movie you could see ten times and still delight in its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut movie, I push to think about what would happen if he got something better from film to film. The only other of his I have seen (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling visually than Ossession (Obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but the story wasn't as involved as Ossessione. If you click on "miscellaneous" on this page's links, there are still images from the movie on these websites. They will not really be entitled to the movie's experience: such graceful camera movements, such beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such amazing characters, such a great storyline, the first movie adapted to James M Cains "The Postman Always Rings Twice." <br /> <br /> I can't believe this was made in 43, eight years before Brando should have introduced realistic action to the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The actors in this must not have used the methodology, that is, they may not have really felt everything (I do not know about it) - but they are some of the best, most genuine and realistic performances up to that date in the cinema. Also eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing since the start of the cinema! Yes, I'm superlative, but Ossessione was just as amazing. The reason why Ossessione did not cause the effect Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini and re-cut in America. American audiences did not see their full glory at 59, eight years after Streetcar. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say more about it - just write to tell you it's one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see the! As another reviewer I will buy it as soon as I can find it!
