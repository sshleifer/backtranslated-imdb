This is a very well-crafted film, carefully targeted and with some excellent character acting at times deeply moving - for example, the stage with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife. The reason is compelling and exciting. Gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the heroes' lives. Obviously, the police are as rough and clear as the underworld characters. <br /> <br /> A few minor caveats: I found the end a little one-sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and judiciary, which uses the ambiguity of the police signs maintained until then. Also I found the leading female character somewhat weak: a little more than a catalyst for the weekend's salvation, all she seems to do is cry and swim like the hard guys knock it out.
