When you get past the movie's title, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of John Waters best. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very fun and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately, this movie was not mass produced, and most of the public is denied the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity knocks, go see this movie.
