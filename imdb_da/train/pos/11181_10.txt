This is one of the fateful, scary and most heartbreaking horror movies, EVER! <br /> <br /> Dr Creed (Louise) and his family move into a new home with their wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Creed loses his patient who had a terrible head injury, then he is joked by the ghost, which Victor takes him to Pet Sematarty and shows him what the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis didn't know if it was a dream come true and is talking to Ellie who was worried about her cat who could be killed by a truck and later on, Rachel told Louis that it really is difficult talk about death due to his sister Zelda who was really sick (As we see in a feedback, how ill his sister really was and this is one of the most craziest scenes ever!) The next day Louis gets a call from Jed who says cat has been killed by truck and Jed takes him to the place where Victor Ghost told him not to go! And burying the cat, his wife and children have gone to see their grandparents and Louise is home alone for the shocked to see the cat is back and now it is so bad in that eyes so he goes to see Jed so Jed tells him that he also buried his dog there too (as we saw other flashback). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie The Family Out Having Picnic Playing Gage with Dragon and Gage Saying I'm Releasing It ", the wind is blowing the rod near the road where a truck comes fast, Gage is closer to the road, Louis hurry to get him.The most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on the floor or tremble will go down in the back when you hear Louis scream Soon he misses him so much, Louis bury Gage in the same place where you burying the cat. <br /> <br /> The scary thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie aren't too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and the play from everyone was great 10 out of 10
