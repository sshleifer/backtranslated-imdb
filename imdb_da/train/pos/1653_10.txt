I agree with everyone who says this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were fascinated by it as it first aired in the US and looked at each episode. At that time I tried to buy the series (I tied it all) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I will be among the first in line to get a copy up. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but brave Bernard Samson was amazing. (He's always great.)
