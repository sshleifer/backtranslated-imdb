A good concept, a great cast, and it was a shame that there was no more time to wipe out the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some real women! Nevertheless, Dench and her character alone had enough content to carry the manuscript over some of its smaller moments. I have it on a leash and will continue to see it, hope there is a slight end that suggests there will be a sequel. Top drawer! - No questions! - No argument! <br /> <br />
