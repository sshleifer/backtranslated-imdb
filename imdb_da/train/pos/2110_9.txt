Much has been written about the plot of the film, the wonderful play, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the amazing direction - what can I add? Just beware of one of the most cordial warming, beautifully traded, exciting scenes ever filmed. It's Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan's character (owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. As each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each one of them turns polite to him. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is a deep grief for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career, and this scene brings me lightly to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy propensity for this very special scene. The new employee, the honorary boy, is the last to leave the store for a beautiful snow-covered street scene. Desperately approaching mr. Matuschek this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has never seen! The robe is overwhelmed, he is of course also lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a nice Christmas dinner. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you manage to get the nice DVD watching the big trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance of the film's director - the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from the beginning to the end.
