Full publication: I'm a cynic. I like my conclusions sad and my heels dry. I didn't cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith's new movie Happiness look like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why on earth did I like "10 items or less?" Maybe it was the double espresso I dropped before the show. Or (more likely) perhaps it was that even the most hard-boiled movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And it's nice. From the moment "Ham" meets "Scarlet" (an event far from a Nora Ephron "Meet Cute"), the view is seen on an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to care about where their lives are going. (Beautifully supported by Phedon Papamichael's film-worthy style camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the movie is that it is too far-fetched. Is the movie far fetched? I do not know. You tell me. I have not yet met Adrian Brody in the market. (But not for missing experiments). Do I like to consider the adventures that might occur if this important event takes place? Darn just I do. . .It is where most reviews of "10 Items or Less" are missing. . .They fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. And heck, sometimes it's worth the price of recording to live them, 82 minutes at a time.
