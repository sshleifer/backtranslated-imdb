It's one of the better Indian movies I've seen lately instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies. All the actors have shown the right emotions with the right intensity with the right timing. It is the hallmark of a good movie that it makes the viewer go back and examine the subject, which exactly I controlled at Harilal. I always enjoy Akshay Khanna's subtle style of acting and interesting, he had a rather complicated relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, albeit not as dramatic as Gandhi's and wondered how it helped him set this character. I was impressed with the direction and 2 thumbs up for Anil Kapoor to produce such a nice film.
