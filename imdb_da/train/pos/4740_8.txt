Okay, it's not a perfect movie in any way, but I disagree with the overall IMDb statement that it's really really bad. I saw so much Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and loved the era deeply. I never saw 'Black Mask' at that time and saw it only last week for the first time. Aside from the embarrassingly poor dubbing that my DVD copy did not allow me to turn off, the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movies during this time. I still stick to my weapons in the opinion that these guys, whatever their budget, adds an element of magic to the screen, no Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I don't beat those movies - I just expect that they lack the spontaneity of this and feel too regulated) will ever reach. What is it? It is the feeling that the filmmakers experimented when they shot and edited, not afraid to leave in some spots to learn lessons for next time. For me this makes watching movies the more fun and dangerous.
