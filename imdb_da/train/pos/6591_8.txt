The invisible man is a show everyone must have love! It reminds me of the old school 80 series (a-team, airwolf, knight's game) The special effects are small, but very effective !! But what's most important is the fun they had shot this series. It really shows! The whole cast fits perfectly into the role, and it seems they can do whatever they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this! For me it is amazing that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting. Don't get a shot in a big movie (Mr Tarantino, this was the show you should have corrected! Instead of the big boring serious danger (csi)) Get this show if you can. well worth it !!!
