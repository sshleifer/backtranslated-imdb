I have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of H.G. Wells classic novel, "World of War". Timothy Hines finally made it! I just couldn't believe how good it was! From that play to the precious, beyond the special effects of this world, I just can't say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-class performances with a top-notch cast! It must be seen as believed. I did not do it. And I've read all the negative comments from the others and can't believe what they said. We must have seen another movie, huh? And the right bad comments from the vepsaian guy, guy who he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about. Keep up the good work, Mr Hines.
