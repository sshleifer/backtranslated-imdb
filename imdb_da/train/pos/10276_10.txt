Opening the movie with a Bach Toccata is a sound question about what should unfold in this intense drama. All the compositions Bach perfected to keep his listener (and practitioner) fascinated and entertained apply to this film. There is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the leading woman in the final scene that I feel is entitled to say that she was raped, even though her victim fighter feels she was warned that he was a cad . Mamet convincingly explores the emotional divide and differences between the sexes, but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment each other with a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet has ever developed a healthy humorous impression on the interactions between the sexes, am I wondering how this work would be completed? As it exists, it is very gloomy and means lively.
