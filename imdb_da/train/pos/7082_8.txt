First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his films, you can see that the characters have those moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every one so far ... and counts. The story begins in the future (not so far), where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the surface of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF, but I think it's closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of history. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower on some points and evolve towards the end than the beginning, but as you see this movie, you will be aware of this constant rhythm of history and reveal facts that do not accelerate or decrease. It is the same speed that gently and fairly flows. But that doesn't mean that the end doesn't pull your nerves because it's pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is a prefect. Films as such are easily destroyed by poor conducting, but this has become much better. So, if you're ready to watch a Sci-Fi movie or action, you'll miss it. B There must be more movies like this.
