A fun game that offers fun and easy play and fair replay ability. Being true to the comic and giving a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most action cartridges today. Also, the famous narratives and animated scenes (although long animations are replaced by slideshows on the Nintendo 64 version), are fully exploited by the platform's capabilities.
