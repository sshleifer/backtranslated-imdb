Excellent story of teens, leaders, high school football "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Right, kill? How much can you lose if you stick out of an innocent girl? Can love beat the odds? Can you defeat narrow minded little townspeople? When your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything to make her pay for it, or will you be a man of it and respect her right to choose? Do you want to rape her and show it as your victory over a "problem" girl? Can you stand by the one who is only sinful, to have his own opinion, to make his own decisions, to choose for himself? It made me think twice before I gave my judgment on who was right and who was wrong, but you are sure - very disturbing movies and theme in general. Thumb up!
