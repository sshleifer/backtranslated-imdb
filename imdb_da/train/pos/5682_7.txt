No, this is no Alice adventure my friends! This 'Wonderland' fable is based on the true story of the cruel bloody Wonderland murders that arose back in the 80's California. At the center of this carnage was none other than `Johnny Wad 'himself. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milking machine. Besides being a legendary adult movie actor, Holmes was also a hardcore addict who was friends with various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes, but for once this character of Holme had not milked it completely. The movie holds a "who's who" of supporting players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffs, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as the women of Holme's life, and Eric Bogosian as a threatening Tinsletown entrepreneur. These characters play directly or indirectly integrating parts in the 'Wonderland' murders. Out of this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the most violent and impressive as the keen Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually escalating to a great Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in "A Beautiful Mind" & "Sweet Home Alabama". Director James Cox turned out to be a bit of a cox sucker by displaying a variety of exaggerated scenes, like Holmes' famous organ. Holmes was eventually acquitted of the 'Wonderland' murders. He died of complications from the AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will keep you in doubt as to what really happened to the bloody night and if Holmes really put his weapon on. Oops! Wrong Holmes movie! Okay! That's enough before I get 'penalized' I mean criminal law. Goodbye Holmies! *** Average
