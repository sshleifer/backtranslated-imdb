One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show approx. 10 times and will probably see it at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often, you would think we didn't do anything but watch it. The beginning of Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either by it or by zipper to the part where Eddie is on stage. Keep an eye on the "Cake or Death" section (Joking about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" section (hard to explain, just see it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expression. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow enough, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie tends to throw many words in four letters.
