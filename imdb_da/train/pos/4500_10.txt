Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be close to his father. Along the way, he falls for Anna, a woman who is 20 years old and who is the wife of her new boss, Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen continues to get Anna to himself and go as far as sabotaging Anna and the cheating Richards marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick sense of humor. The actors are amazing: Green of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" smolders on the screen as the cunning but warm-hearted Owen; Annis of "Dune" fame is lively and shows a good fight for Green; Kitchen, from "To Play the King" is the right threat as Richard, whose comic book and snobbery emphasizes his masterful, Owen's building hat. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the three characters' feelings and ambiguities, you get away better to know and see them.
