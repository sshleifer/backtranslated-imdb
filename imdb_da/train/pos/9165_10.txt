This should be the best fit I've seen, it's my favorite, and I think it stays very close to the book. What really does this is a must, but is the molding of the two main players. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester you have seen on the screen brooding and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shame and gentleness as Jane. The story (which I am sure most people know) is this, the young and pure Jane Eyre is a teacher of girls' charity in the 19th century, announcing her services as governor of the newspapers. She offered the post as governess at the great mansion of Thornfield Hall to advisor Adele the young branch of the mysterious and respected owner Mr Rochester Halls. During the months, he falls in love with Jane and comes into force to try and see if Jane is so crazy in love with him as he is with her. But there is a secret that is still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when it is, the effects are devastating. This is a moving and well-acted drama with beautiful places and beautiful costumes plus as I said before, excellent plays especially from Zelah and Timothy.
