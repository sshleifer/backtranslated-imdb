Resident Evil: Code Veronica is a well-established video game, it has great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great story and great fun factor. The story of this is Claire Redfield being taken to an island for violating umbrella areas and reacting chaos at being the main laboratory while looking for her brother. Code veronica's graphics are very good, fire and rain effects are great. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not match the Dreamcast control, making it difficult to use. It's still fun to walk around in a disturbing place and shoot the intestines out of zombies. Code: Veronica also has a little bit of "romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 The sound of this game is better than ever, for example, even though I hate the new feature. When the giant spiders crawl, their feet are a disturbing scampering sound, and the weapons sound much more realistic. Good graphics, excellent history, comfy controls and realistic sound make Resident Evil Code: Veronica a loved one. I give it a 10 out of 10.
