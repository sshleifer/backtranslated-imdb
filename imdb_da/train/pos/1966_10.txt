I'm not a regular commentary on this site, but see how underrated this movie is, I endeavor to write some comments and remarks about it. I had fun watching this movie, maybe because Cat is all I could wish I could be, I don't want to send spoilers or reveal plots, but there are things that I really found amazing, the way she manipulates people It's just so divine. this is a very underestimated movie, i lack arguments here, i usually enjoy and then talk a little about it when you go to the cinema, have fun and i really enjoyed 1h53, i stayed in the dark room. a must be seen again and again until the joy falls away. Let's try not to be so critical of it. thank you for reading.
