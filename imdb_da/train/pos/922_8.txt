At least half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything on the big 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) this year. All the lions are interesting, though Larry may be annoying at times. I really like Middle Earth action characters they bring in with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. The side show Siegfried and Roy are entertaining at times too. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best CG that has been performed on a weekly television show. Usually when hiring big names for the star of a show, they try to hide a poor script or character. Not quite true in this show, but there are a few characters that were weak and improved by the voice, but generally the characters stand alone. <br /> <br /> This is certainly for 16 and up. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before, and most jokes would probably just fly over their heads. It's certainly not as raw and edgy as South Park, but brings some of the same "Bash all" to it. One example is that it makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in an episode. <br /> <br /> The father of Pride and other Dreamworks productions such as Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and Brain, and Freakazoid. It is the same type of humor adult up. It can't be as witty as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. I hope it will finish this season well and be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I can never find a reason to see the big 3 again.
