Another small piece of the Holocaust's big picture puzzle is facing upwards in this documentary about Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin, an event I had not known about which began in late February 1943. The details are set out in a supplement that follows this review. <br /> <br /> The film's story sets the story of this protest in another, contemporary story that begins in New York City today. Here is a wealthy, non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died, shocked her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox grief. She goes even further and requires her daughter's non-Jewish fianc√© to leave the house. The distressed daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) learns for the first time from an older cousin that during World War II in Berlin, her mother, when 8 years old, had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin, and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. It all seems to be too pat. <br /> <br /> The film then improves and focuses through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that referred to the protest, where the fictional key character is the same wife Fischer of 33 played wonderful by Katja Riemann), a baroness and complete pianist married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained on the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The story goes back to the present from time to time and ends again in New York City. While scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong on blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of the play is generally pretty good, what we might have given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the new German cinema's most prominent female filmmaker, even a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is simply told. Only one function is missing that would have helped: Still-text notes at the end, indicating the final result for the persons detained at Rosenstrasse, a result which, as the addendum below shows, is incredibly positive. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" has not performed well in the opinion of most film critics. Too long, superfluous layered, provider of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: Then go the usual rapeseed. It is too far. But I found in this film a strong, powerful, spontaneous and totally convincing test of the women who kept the watch out of the place on Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I found nothing flashy, modern or manipulative in this depiction. Much absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my excitement, which gradually rose as the film progressed. You continue to wait for an evil attack to start a moment. The movie's gloom remained with me afterwards. I often woke up later in the night, I watched the movie, my mind was filled with gloomy, melancholy, chaotic images and emotions caused by the movie. It rarely happens to me. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Set on 05/31/05).

But before the deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, the wives and other relatives got wind of what happened and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address first in the two and two and then in ever increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest, but not all at the same time. Women demanded back their husbands day by day, for a week. Unarmed, disorganized and unmanageable, they faced the most brutal forces available to the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, Gauleiter (governor or district leader) in Berlin, eager to have the city racially cleaned, was also responsible for the country's public morale. On both sides he was concerned about the possible consequences of the woman's actions. Instead of inviting more open dissent by shooting the women into the streets and fearing to put the secret of "the final solution" in jeopardy, Goebbels gave Hitler's simultaneous Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of those already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all those who were released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an amazing victory over the destruction forces.
