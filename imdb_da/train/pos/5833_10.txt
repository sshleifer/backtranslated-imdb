I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy. Light up already. These two were a rebellion. Their comics are just as fun today as 70 years ago. Not a dirty word out of both mouths and they were able to keep the audience in the sting. Their comedy was not sophisticated by any stretch. If a whoopee pillow can't make you laugh, there's no reason to see any of the things these guys did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were fun without a plot. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy these things so I qualify. Two man comedy teams do not calculate, we are just too sophisticated ... Are we not lucky?
