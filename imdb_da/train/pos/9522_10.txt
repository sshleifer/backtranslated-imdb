This is the first Tom Hanks movie I have had the privilege to see in the theater, even though he is my favorite. When I heard that he was going to play a hitman, I was a little stunned thinking "can Mr Hanks pull this off"? And he did high fashion. This 1930's Depression Eagle movie is about loyalty, redemption and a road that you don't want your children to stumble upon. Tom Hanks leads a starring game like Michael Sullivan. Being the family man and the secret life of the contract killer of Oscar nominee Paul Newman. This movie Tom Hanks relies more on reaction and gaze than dialogue, which he delivers a knockout performance. On an evening of one of his jobs, Michael's son Michael Jr., beginner Tyler Hoechlin, testified to the heat. And Michael Sr.'s partner in crime, actor Daniel Craig, can't get this information out. So he wacks Michael Sr. son and wife, except Michael Jr. So the two head to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Paul Newman's Mr. Rooney). <br /> <br /> The drama and intense plot really thicken from those that Dad tries to put things right even though son is together for the ride. On this deadly journey, someone hired a hit for Michael Sr. The murder would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a spotty teeth Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The movie makes you feel the old days. And with Thomas Newman's beautiful and scary Oscar-nominated score to go along with it, you can't avoid appreciating this film from Oscar's winning director Sam Mendes. Then sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
