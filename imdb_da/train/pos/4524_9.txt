This is a very rare example of a film about transvestitism (of heterosexuals). The film deals with the taboo theme so that even a general audience who does not know transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with the protagonist. Adrian Pasdar is very trustworthy as Gerald / Geraldine and must not be forgotten for this brilliant actor. The management of Christopher Monger is very sensitive and deals with such a difficult problem quite excellently, wrapped in a good story. Not a big movie, neither an "art" movie, but a little nice movie picture!
