First saw this movie in about 1990, and died completely laughing at it. It became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we would quote it by the drop of a hat ("I go home in a bag!"). Of course humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition in Halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this movie (good thing you can still buy it from Ebay!) I found out that Halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted in your kind.and this film gives it all-pathos, excitement, unjustified love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano gives a fantastic heart-like performance to Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "Laos 7 Faces" as a bad guy who met a bad end. Here you really feel for the old guy right from the start. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. The creators became really subtle in many ways with offhand comments, small subtle costume tombs on other sci-fi movies, and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Also, don't use many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people - it's fun fare without the need for nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they don't know that they will be mocked ..). <br /> <br /> -Now, if you apologize, I'll get a "Zag nut" bar .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / entertainer
