I took this out intentionally from the library the second night, without any idea of ​​the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently staged as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are on the goal, it moves fun, sad, and yes, a bit utilizing despite the film's best intentions. The extended Chriterion Edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in little Edie fall of a class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in Jackie Os's old movie; People just don't talk anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information on how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems to be aware of what happens to some extent; Couldn't she see the outstandingly spectacular home disintegrating? <br /> <br /> But the subject of the movie is the life the two women have designed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams an action. Worth your time.
