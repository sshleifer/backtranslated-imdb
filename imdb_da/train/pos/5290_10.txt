Going for something far away from the deliberately rough things he usually does, John Waters (congratulations on John's birthday!) Made this parody of celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his great break, which he accepts. But when he hits the big one, he has to reconsider everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life when he becomes a celebrity. The kind of things we might expect, but with Waters Directing, there are always a few things to shock us (you know them when you see them). I highly recommend it. Also with Christina Ricci, Mink Chairs and Patty Hearst.
