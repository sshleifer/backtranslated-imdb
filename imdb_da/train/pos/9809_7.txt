Randolph Scott enters Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. On the road, however, the stage has stopped - even though they do not carry a strongbox. A lovely lady on board hides $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the robbers seem to know it. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle about the job. However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - the typical bad guy from western. You know the rich guy who will only get richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott demands that uncle returns the money, and then Scott goes on with the lovely lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of the problems --- just the beginning. Again and again, there are intrigues of different types to try to crush the uncle's resistance. One trick is to bring a beautiful lady to be friends with Scott and his partners. She's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott - until he figures out why she's come to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most later Randolph Scott movies, it shows Scott as a slightly more headstrong man. Too often in his film, he is the last to propose violence, but in this movie he is quick to suggest a lynching (turn the law, let's get a hangin ') and later he is quick to threaten uncle. What a surprise to see him as such a hot-head - but in most other ways he is the same old Scott you would expect. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, there is nothing unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, baddie cannot be justified and ultimately destroyed, and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, it is all handled very well and as a result it is worth your time. By the way, there are two strange scenes in the movie. Only late in the movie is a fist between Scott and the uncle's # 1 hands, Lon Chaney, Jr. In it, Chaney reveals as he is fighting - something I've never seen before, and I admired how he could blow away when he got his ass kicked. Second, get a load of the running lane with the whip - now it was an impossible experience!
