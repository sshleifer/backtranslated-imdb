I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday, and I really liked it. Stone once again delivered a great character. She was as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has these smart but difficult answers. Although Sharon can be 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a great end that makes you think and talk about it for hours! Half of the people who commented on this movie haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them.
