Now Tenko is without a doubt the best British television show ever, the show, the steering, the casting, the excitement, the drama ..... everything is great about it. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell a little later in its last season, this final movie picked up on the threads nicely and woven a great story for fans of the show and newbies. I can't recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I recommend watching the series first, as the first 2 seasons are even better than this amazing movie. An obvious (10/10)
