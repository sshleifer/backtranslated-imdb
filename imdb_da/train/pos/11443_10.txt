This film is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. An artist's deep vision, his art that intuitively jumps from his natural source, brings us to an inspiring Hosanna, blends his creations with trees, white water stretches toward rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer want to be alive, aware that we are all made of clay of this glorious earth. He does not save us for his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle of art with nature. Credit also goes to the filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer, who instructed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you have a sense of beauty, nature and art ... Don't miss this amazing movie!
