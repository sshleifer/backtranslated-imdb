The third Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard movie is a little more serious than the hands over the table and the princess comes over. It is yet another adaptation of the game Burlesque, which apparently was popular back in the day. The original game Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances, and that is the role Carole Lombard plays Barbara Stanwyck comes from Broadway, who brought her to Hollywood. A version starred Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. In fact, I have a vinyl album of a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting work, believe me. Yet MacMurray and Lombard are doing well with the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub, where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet. Note a good performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen that comes between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on Lombard's husband. Swing High, Swing Low keeps up really nice today and I wouldn't be surprised if we see another version of burlesque in the 21st century.
