This movie deserves a 10 for its brilliant depiction of the world as experienced in a playboy's mind. While I found that world morally repulsive, the film made the best thing the story was going to do, and it takes us through an experience we would never otherwise experience. Tim Meadows shows so convincing Leon Phelps, and the story so drawn me in Leon's ruthless world that I immediately forgot that I saw a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it. Here the film is enchanting because its great and bold performance in the story comes to the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of filmmakers will only respond to the story of this film lying on the surface and rejecting that story I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved it. I loved it not only for its fascinating insight into the playboy's confused mind, not only for its entertaining depiction of the human sex drive's idiot, but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just fun.
