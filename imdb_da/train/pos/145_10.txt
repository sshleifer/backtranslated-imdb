Sequel for the "Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and similar weird movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> You don't have to see Part 1 to understand this ... you'll find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon films in a theater is tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will probably not be a "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after it was filmed. But you never know!
