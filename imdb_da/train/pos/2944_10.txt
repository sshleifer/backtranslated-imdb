This is hands down the biggest stand up show ever. I've seen a lot of stand up shows, been to many stand up shows and watch Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who could match Murphy's abilities on this show. Impressions are excellent, the sketches are good and the timing is perfect. You can even tell the crowd really gets to. When he advised a few years later, it was also really good, but it is # 1 in my book. Also shows that at some point, especially early to the mid-eighties, Murphy was fun. My favorite parts of the show are when he tells the family grill and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! The ice cream man comes!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
