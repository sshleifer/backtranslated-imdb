This is one of the best movies out there and it says a lot that it was for television. I really want it to be on the e.g. Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance. She played a rookie policeman who was thrown into serial killer. When she fell apart because he was killing another child, it was great. She is so alone that he comes to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Serial killer Steven Weber was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing the kids, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really don't make them any more. It was a real thriller without being gory.
