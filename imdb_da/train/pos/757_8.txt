I have to be honest. I saw and enjoyed this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious and raunchy. Yes, there is a lot of humor to every taste. If you are in the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example, then you will have a good time for it. <br /> <br /> Or if you enjoy people in extreme stunt actions that go bad, you will also have a good time. And if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I enjoy all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. I like to have a hard laugh with the show's situations. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park in relation to this. So if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, give it a chance for English extreme stupidity on this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or widespread. <br /> <br /> Now these guys should see a psychologist. Especially the Paco character.
