This is one of the movies that provide better trailers than full-length movies. The concept was really cool and different, humor was unique, I just felt there were missing opportunities to put "blows" into this movie. So many lines and gags were left hanging for too long without any definite ending and really did not leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underutilized in this movie and needed more exposure and more opportunities to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a DVD rental. I was also looking for some kind of good music video under the final credits, something that has become a kind of brand for these romantic comedy films, one thing about Mary, meets the parents, but again I was left a little cheated by the fact that this could Have been a much better movie with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It felt like it was HEALTH in theaters.
