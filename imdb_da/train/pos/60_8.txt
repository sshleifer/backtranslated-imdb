"Home Room" as "Zero Day" and "Elephant" were inspired by the recent wave of plays. But, unlike the other two movies, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or they killed) after a shoot. Make it less useful and more useful because little effort is wasted by asking questions for which there is no answer. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little movie during the first 20 minutes it should be set up the real story, but play as a rejected "Hill Street Blues" episode. It's lame, but carry it, at least pads the running length enough to get the movie classified as a function. I recommend skipping this completely and just jumping to the hospital's scenes - there's nothing here that you can't get from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good little movies, it was creatively a one-man show like Paul F. Ryan was both author and director. While this event does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a particular unit of construction and execution, often lacking in large budget dramatic features. As the "Home Room" script is its real strength, it is fortunate that the author also performed the production and assured that his vision did so on the screen. Ryan takes a big chance at the end, testing the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge, but against all logic you leave crying instead of calling. Why stop works is a combination of audiences need a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") he goes on and the amazing last minute editing. <Br /> <br /> The second strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as main characters. Although Phillips plays his standard alienated surly teen and Christensen's intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of the two girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What happens here is all about two of them despite a lame side story of a police detective wondering about the city trying to tie Alicia to the lonely shooter. If they ever circumcise and trim the film, this side story must be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story of two extremely disparate girls who bind and help each other is hardly a new idea, and Ryan could easily have steered this movie into clich√© and predictability. But instead, his script has them in a fascinating and convincing sparring battle, slowly flipping away and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat in themselves. Deanna's "I'm dying inside" line tears you apart - I can't think of a moment in another movie that I felt as intense as it was. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retires. The viewer continues to expect the group squad that never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it not only generates a lot of excitement, but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses that brought them to life. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
