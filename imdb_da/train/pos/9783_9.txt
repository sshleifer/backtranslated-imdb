How to say that peaches, with its complex narrative dealing with a wide range of issues, is "a small TV idea", lies outside of me. In addition, I can think of many movies that have "a small TV idea" in their plot. Your obvious aversion to the television industry ("Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background") is confusing. especially since you have such a "good time" working on television. If we could only be as talented as Mrs Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ, the Way of Koorain, etc. All made for television. Come to think of it, what about the other "small TV ideas" like "against the wind", "the bodylin", "rejection", "adjustment scales", "blue murder", "water under the bridge", etc. I think peaches are a good entertaining movie that had me interested, and most of my friends also from start to finish. It's far from flawless, but I think it's among the best Australian movies I've seen in the last few years. Who knows, with a few views (there is so much to think about), it may just be up there with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I really enjoy this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These movies I think had their moments-surrealistic, atmospheric, realistic, and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as of pure entertainment for mr. And wife, transparent film-maker and me, it was very common if it wasn't boring. When I go into a movie, I am always aware of the audience's reaction to a movie (through reactions from the Internet and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo). Some came out of peaches shaking their heads, some with negative criticism, but many seemed to have had the experience.
