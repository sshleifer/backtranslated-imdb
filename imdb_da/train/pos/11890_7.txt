This is pretty boring movie. Well shot with realistic notions, especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and a bad boy with realistic places mood and artificial conflicts everywhere, it fails because the director does not take a stand, stand or critical comment on the subject he sets. One of France's reverent and firm partner on film with Depardieu - I think they made 7 together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a clear caring girlfriend and kind hearted man around. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the filander with unclear distinction, gives oprobrium answers like "I don't know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he loves" on her questioning husband trying to kick her out of the house, but palletizing and rethinking because ... I guess he loves her. Then he accepts and hopes for what? That one day she will wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's disappointing documentary style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add. I know the answers do not add, but please take a stand. Jules and Jim, it's not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just seen is heartache and headache only for the most forgiving.
