Jessica Alba's Max and Valerie Rae Miller's Original Cindy shines in this action packed and atmospheric series. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high and when not, Jessica is always worth looking at. Valerie's urban jivetalking African American is almost always pulling Dark Dark in the sitcom area.
