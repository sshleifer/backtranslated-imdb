I don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or otherwise consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> What about just being entertained? Something that Morgan Freeman excels in. He gets a chance to show himself a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets names to pull people into watching his movie. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some patos, a little bittersweet but nothing over the top. I got a special kick out of Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says, "You make me a woman." He's just fun. The fighting scene between Mrs Vega, her former husband and his girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> In short, it's a cute, charming movie that makes you smile. You could do much, much worse.
