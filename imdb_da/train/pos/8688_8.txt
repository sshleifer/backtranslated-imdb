A very high standard of Columbo history, which was actually the first movie-based episode of the long-running series, but was originally transferred to another (after "Murder By The Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency who is chanting the wife (Patricia Crowley) of a rich, highly influential businessman (played very sympathetically by Ray Milland), after falsifying a report to her favor after it was discovered, she had an affair. The wife later reacts to the harassment scheme, but is killed in rage .... A very satisfactory episode in many respects, especially since the plot is so heavily set and subsequently developed and also because of the rare Columbo ingredient that the crime is an unforeseen killing . The whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed man uses the killer to help Columbo in his studies: a feature that facilitates many good scenes, especially in the first order when the three key characters meet, and Columbo's decisive delusional qualities are wonderful evidence . <br /> <br /> Directed with the flair of Bernard L. Kowalski and acted at a suitably high level, this really set the tone for the whole series (since "Murder By the Book" was let down by a bad end). The script from Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link are precise, well-structured and well thought-out and supported by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences that truly show the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the final assembly denotes that Columbo has always been a step ahead of the killer. All in all, this is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and constructively to make a polished Columbo story.
