Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderful over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit game. Enter young wondering child (a solid Reeve) who has just written such a game. Weave into this Bruhl's excessively hysterical wife (excellent game of cannon) and a German psychic (a very fun Irene Worth), and you've got yourself a wonderful fun thrill. <br /> <br /> Although not up to "Sleuth" standards, "Deathtrap" is nevertheless a very skilled, twisted-filled comic thrill based on a fantastic piece by Ira Levin. Of course, the artists have a market with the material, with Caine in particular to supply top notch lines with gusto. <br /> <br /> The movie loses some steam in between and the end is much less satisfying than the fun of the original game, but generally "Deathtrap" is solid, well-acted and exciting fun.
