TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> Over the years, audiences have seen and understood war movies with every point of show possible And somehow, manufacturers and writers come up with new and innovative ways to portray different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM"), which one of the most risky executives is currently working on, has resembled "The Thin Red Line" in the way his new drama Tigerland enters a single soldier's shoes. This movie, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan." Although the dramatic impact of the film is a little less because of the perversity of the current material, it certainly informs us of a new perspective of young men training for war. <br /> <br /> I want to know Joel Schumacher's experience with the army. Are the men really this mind-boggling and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell) rebelling against acts of war. His personality immediately opposes several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fiery temper often interferes with Bozz's excitement with the idea of ​​going to war. The war depicted in this production is not on a battlefield, but on a training ground for a Louisiana-based teaching theory between concept and fear of the soldiers in training. This film is especially about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, a little disappointing, as witness to the signs of action would have served as a supurb payoff. <br /> <br /> On-site shot for about 28 days using 16mm stock and a small budget, Joel Schumacher shows precisely a gritty, perverse, cruel and relentless atmosphere using handheld filmography, unique lighting technology and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown pictures make the film feel like a documentary feature. This unusual form of film production only contributes to the film's hard core realism, rather graphic in the use of rough language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four letter words pound audience, some in shock of what they hear. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not hold the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> If anything, "Tigerland" gives us a lesser understanding of how much our soldiers go through to our country at the beginning of the fighting. Such bravery must take it into consideration in the army during wartime, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. Such thought-provoking ideas are made possible by the heartbreaking achievements of the young aspiring actors depicting the various trainees. This movie is not for all audiences, but one for young men to look at before using the army ... and adult audiences should look to appreciate the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
