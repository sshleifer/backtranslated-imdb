The Booth puts a whole new twist on your typical J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the history of the shoe. The director wants you to see what the protagonist looks and thinks. The story is about the perception of the people who work, live and love our protagonist, and how he perceives the people who surround him in an outdated radio station DJ booth. The story frightens the protagonist's team as an onion in flashbacks when the film runs its course, and from that we learned that things are not always the way it works. The film was mainly in a small, updated radio station's study with a very bad story, where the protagonist was forced to send his talk show because the radio station was being repositioned. It is from this limited space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At that time, our protagonist could not state that the strange events in the old studio were caused by ghost or any conspiracy of his co-workers, or it was all in his mind. What I think about this movie is that the filmmakers make you look through the main character's eyes and make you as paranoid as the main character did. This movie is a very smart, abide right short 76 minute movie.
