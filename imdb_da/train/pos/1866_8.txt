A great story based on a true story of a young black man and all the difficulties along the way. Being that this is Denzel Washington's first ever movie, which he himself was supposed to lead, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical, but who wouldn't be ..? But then again he is a great actor with many years of experience, and the end result proved good. The story is told in a good way, which makes you who have had difficulties during your childhood and adulthood see yourself in these situations. So it hits you hard so you know you're not the only one going through hell. All in all, a moving story about a young man trying to do so in this world war. (The story is based on Antwone Fisher's life, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this movie) highly recommended. 8.10
