I was too young to remmeber when I first saw this movie. But I saw it as the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has hidden it. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after all this time. Sure, it's about a real, really full millionaire who is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still has lost mankind in the others we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. A lot of laughs. It's hilarious, sweet, and if you're a movie, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny". See it with a group of your friends or family and I promise you will never have anything to talk about ever again with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh in the years to come. It's really hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie I feel made us closer. And I know it will do the same for you !!
