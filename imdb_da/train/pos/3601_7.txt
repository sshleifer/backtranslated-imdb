Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging power of other actresses to watch out for. She has the courage to place herself in a rarely hardy role very early in her career (and pull it off), which is an experience that should be recognized. Although her later movie pigeonhole made her the same role, this movie was made for her robustness. Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover who struggles to overcome her unfavorable existence in the projects, which is a bit exaggerated in film ... but not by a girl. The aspect of this movie is not so original, but the story goes deep in the depths of the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with, and her primary rage takes over. <br /> <br /> I have 'I've seen an actress so aggressive in filmmaking yet, and I'm glad she gets the original twist out there in Hollywood. This movie got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth, but it has such a great actress showing a rarely seen role in a minimal budget film. Nice work.
