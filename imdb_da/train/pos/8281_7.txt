From the first scene I was really excited. "I can tell this will be great!" I thought. The action was so good, I felt like I fell into the lives of these people. Also the music was exquisitely disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then drove forward (one could sense) against an irreversible fate. The building was slow, but I personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet excitement stays on the track and doesn't get tracked until it's ready to pay. <br /> <br /> So everything goes fine and then fireworks begin and before you know it, the credits are running. "WHAT?!!!" was all I and my filmmate could say. If you understand the director's intentions, the slim ending gives meaning (for those of you who have already seen the movie, see the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can't help saying it didn't pulled out completely. <br /> <br /> This could have been solved by as little as ten minutes of material before climax. In any case, it's too bad. The ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or produce movies, you should know that making a story arc with the right timing is a big pain in the butt and I certainly do not make this criticism from any pedestal!) /> <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece that was given up before it was finished. But hi, I would take a broken masterpiece some day over an overproduced piece of dog poe overcompensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). Another comment. Some of the monsters' scenes left me confused whether I should be scared or laughed. I don't know how to explain it, but there was a distinct Monty Python feel about this monster in its more blatant "monster" forms. Though it may sound like a horrible criticism for a horror movie - I don't know, it still worked for me in an odd way. I will never look at deer horns the same way again! :)
