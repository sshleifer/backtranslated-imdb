Director Edward Montagne does in just over an hour what other, more expensive and hyped films fail to do. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. that while it is not one of the best genres, it keeps the viewer involved in everything going on. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a B-type movie. In fact, the best thing going for "The Tattooed Stranger" is the ability to look the way New York looked at these years. The crystal clear filmography by William O. Steiner, either been preserved that way over the years, or has been lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> There is a great view of New York in the opening sequence. Later, we are taken to Brooklyn in the Dumbo section, and later the film travels to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a large detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant expert from the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> Seeing a city was fun because it didn't exist anymore.
