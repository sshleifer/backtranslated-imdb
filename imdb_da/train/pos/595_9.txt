When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he had built a complete Alamo set in the city of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. As long as it stands, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations for the screen. One with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was done in this century. <br /> <br /> But I want to say Alamo: Thirteen days to Glory is the best Alamo story I've seen. John Wayne's movie is a good one if it's overheated, but it's a John Wayne movie with the story transformed to fill out parameters of John Wayne's screen character. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a nice interpretation of the rolling border character he was. <br /> <br /> It is much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than the Wayne movie was and after reading the book's years ago I can attest it. Tinkle's book was built as a source in both films, but Tinkle, who lived back when the Wayne movie was finished, and he was not satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was about the right age for young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who was a slave owner. Back in the day, there was no ironic contradiction in it. One thing that was not explored and not been was Travis hyperactive sex drive. He was Casanova in the southwest, he even kept a fun diary with his libidinal conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the laundering is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. He was completely in Alamo to be sure, but his career before the Alamo was a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, a man selling land around, he had a dubious title to. But his heroic death freed him safely. No hint of it is in Arness's portrayal or anyone else I've seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he made the Bowie knife, finished with his specifications. That man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> But the most important asset, Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory, is a full-blown depiction of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, President of Mexico, who comes up personally to put up the rebels of the North Americans who have come to settle in Texas by Mexican invitation. Unfortunately, these Americans came with some preconceived notions of freedom that had just not made it so far south, at least the freedom of white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also quite a scoundrel, but he was the best Mexico produced until a true reformer named Benito Juarez came together. <br /> <br /> This movie was the color scheme of Lorne Greene, shown briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not quite my view of Houston, he was really too old for that, Houston was in his early eighties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic tale of the Alamo story, at least John Wayne's version is understood, but for historical content I highly recommend this movie.
