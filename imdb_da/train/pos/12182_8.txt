I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box kit I had recently purchased. A box set I got first and foremost because I wanted to own a man for all seasons and also to evaluate Waterloo again. So I keep Orson and Rita in the player, and I'm treated in class and confusion on equal terms. <br /> <br /> On the surface, history seemed a simple one to meet beautiful woman and save her from a couple of thugs, they immediately click and man is offered work on a cruise with a woman and her famous lawyer husband, and so ............. <br /> <br /> .. well it becomes the murder mystery of the plot devilment and very shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) does not really know what is going on, he is as confused as the viewer, and it is great to see as he is drawn all over the place with just about everyone in the movie. Of course, being pulled by the heartbeat of a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, you just know that things should go in pear shape. So many wonderful things in the movie have the Welles visual style over it, see a scene in an aquarium that is wonderful, and they end up in a fun house is majestic on the eye. The story from O'Hara is pleasantly self-sucking, and we get good relief in the form of a lawsuit with Everett Sloane brightening up. <br /> <br /> But the movie is a weird, and in fact, it's a creepy experience because {as I had to find out} studio bosses cut the movie for almost an hour and that's just not frustrating for us the viewer, but unfair on Welles vision. I am positive that a full original cut of this movie would have been promised and honored wholesale, as it is tho, we have a very good and exciting movie, one that unfortunately only suggests greatness but is still a hostile movie that I I am glad that I own to look into. 8.5 / 10
