"Life hits us in the face ........ We must try to be beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut movies from one of Belgian best artists (he sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited movie and --- happy happy delight in Flemish filmmaking --- really worth seeing and a promising piece of work! It takes us in the lives of 8 protagonists living through a Friday and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float as they do at Friday night's party, where they just meet. <br /> <br /> It is Rhythmic style that is very 'thought'. Excellent use of music. It sometimes takes the upper hand over the pictures, and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience causing the way it is shot. It really stays with it while it is set in a small place where many people have a big party ..... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thanks menu Barman for making this bold movie in These, already some years gone, poor times of Flemish filmmaking. You saved my day!
