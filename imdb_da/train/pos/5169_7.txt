I watched the last five or ten minutes of this movie back in 1998 or 1999 one night when I was on channel surfing before going to bed and really liked what I saw. Since then, I've been looking for, scouring TV listings, flipping through DVD / VHS racks in stores, but didn't find a copy until recently when I found out that some internet stores were selling it. Then I still didn't order it because I was a first-rate procrastinator. Finally, I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it only took me a month after returning home before I sat watching it. <br /> <br /> So what am I thinking about the movie? It is well. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth $ 9.99 it cost me. After watching the whole movie for the first time, I rate it as a 7/10, with the potential to be an 8/10. I need to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to get a dialogue.
