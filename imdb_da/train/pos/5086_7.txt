When I finally heard Patrick Swayze return to his acting career with KING SOLOMON'S MINES, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones type of action adventure. What I got was a 4 hour long (with advertising) epic that was very slow. The second and third hours could have dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered. The finish was good (no spoilers here) but I was still back who wanted more. Well, a guy can do is swap that Swayze is doing RoadHouse 2 so he can get back to the action genre that made him famous. Until then, if you are a fan of King Solomon's Mines than reading the book or seeing the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is not very good either, but it is only an hour and forty and forty minutes in your life gone in instead of 4 hours.
