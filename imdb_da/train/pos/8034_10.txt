There are few movies that seem to give enterntainment as well as realism. If you've ever wondered about Sniper's role in the modern war, take a look at this. <br /> <br /> I just loved the scene where a hundred soldiers shoot in the jungle, no one sure where that shot came? <br /> <br /> And they nodded a scene to save private Ryan so it needs some profit in the scene. <br /> <br />
