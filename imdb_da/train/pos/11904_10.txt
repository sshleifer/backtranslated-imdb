I gave it a 10, because everyone else liked it and it would have been rude not to. The reason I worry is to add a personal note about slots work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the clever color sequence where everything but the blood is in black and white) a few times and "The House On Haunted Hill" many times. Although I'm not old enough to have seen them, the castle was up to his showman tricks so I can appreciate them for their own profit. And although most people deliver him as second frequency, schlocky, hammy, etc., I think they make him a bad service. The end sequence of "homicidal" is quite shocking and works today - and the priest of "The Tingler" while stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. After using the Frank Lloyd Wright House as its exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus a good score and production value - produced when I first saw it on a packed late night in the late 60's, It produced an audience reaction I hadn't seen before and haven't seen the page. <br /> <br /> It was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading now), and we're waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> With no telegraphing of what's coming, the camera slowly pulls back and forces the AUDIENCE to switch eyes to ... I say no more (my "spoiler" declaration above covers only this movie). The point is that I think this bite was DELIBERATE - not by chance - and when that happened, the whole whole was frightened (including most of the men!) It took the audience in ten minutes to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now there is better film making. A flamboyant showman he could have been, but "House" and the other two movies I mentioned were good movies. The castle may not have been a Hitchcock, but he wasn't Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> Concentrating on others' quirks is easy and forgets to explore their talents. So I hope this documentary has recognized it. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
