Having seen Charley Boorman in the Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested in seeing how Charley would be in his own show. I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth. It's great to see celebrities struggling with their weight and fitness, it just shows their human! I don't know much about bicycles, but this show caught me right from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems enormous. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else do it and how far he gets. I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music. I can't believe he broke his collarbone, I really hope it's not the end, I can't wait to see the next episode ...
