OK, I saw this in the theaters when it came out, and I don't know why. I haven't seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this movie - again I don't know why. But the fact that I remember it speaks volumes. Comedy is difficult - much harder than any drama. Doing it right makes it easy, but does it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, please note that you fall into this category again for some reason. Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have made it right for me to remember this film fondly. Performed at a fast pace with the tongue in the cheek and knowing that it is not Philedelphia Story, it entertaines from start to finish. Brain Donors is another that fits right in this category (sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes). <br /> <br /> A point of doubt - the end. It seems that the authors / director had no idea how to finish a comedy. The end is trying to be a love story, which undermines the quirky, fast-paced dialogue until that time. Then there is the "tassle" stage. While this should be seen (male meaning), it is so over the top and out of place it is like a shock. A more rewrite to the end was necessary. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you, you will laugh, I guarantee it.
