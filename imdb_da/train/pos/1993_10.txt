This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's "Oliver Twist". For the most part, the original story has been maintained, but for the flow of the movie, some subplots (like the summer he spent recuperating and the half-brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in the movie and the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hung - one end very different from this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is a unique musical - one whose style and scope are really not matched sooner or later. Not only are the songs often quite visible and memorable, but the film's choreography is a sight to behold. While in most musicals a few people or maybe even a small group are choreographed dancing, the numbers often run into hundreds or perhaps more. It's really a sight to see, and I was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories. I just saw it again a few moments ago, I had to say that the movie only improved over time. Great set, wonderful play and song - this is a special treat that is hard to not love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I watched the movie again tonight, I was amazed at how tall and feminine Mark Lester's song was for the movie. Well, according to IMDb, his song was dubbed by a girl, and that would definitely be his voice.
