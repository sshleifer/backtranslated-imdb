It is rare that you come across a movie as flawless as this. It really is one of the best-liked, most structured films I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways that relate to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an inner web of motivations and crosses that cut you and refuse to let go. Add to this that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is moving as something that has ever been committed to celluloid, and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. It reveals the romance of movies as "Titanic" as the trite cliches they are. If you are looking for a movie to be seen while folding laundry, this is not the case. You must commit to this movie. You can't have a conversation as you run in and out of space. This movie requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you get a lot from it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the greatest movie ever.
