"Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress, one night saving a visit's Arab life from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the US government. Will corridors of power in our country's capital ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual, though "protocol" is not as fun as her best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
