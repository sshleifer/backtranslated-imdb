Excellent movie. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were used in large trains, not in the local railway - according to history, Chikatilo fetched his victims in local train stations. Apart from this, the film is amazing.
