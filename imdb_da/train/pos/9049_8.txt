There is an old proverb that relates to Joe Johnston, who re-emerges as a brilliant movie that goes like this: "The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can't, are both right. " It is an extremely attenuating statement of self-motivation and belief in a person who in this movie is true, even though roadblocks and family problems are in the way. "October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself, called Homer Hickam, grows up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves in a small coal mining, where almost all people grow up to be miners. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell all believe that their life after high school will be like everyone else. Homer is not excited about this future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone stares into the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new to Homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his gaze on life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone he wants to work in the rocket research area for a profession. Flabbergasted on what he says, his family passes the idea over their heads and continues with life as normal. However, his friends believe that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart person when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start testing model rockets and blowing a white fence for smiths, it seems like a forest fire is afraid of those they are forced to complete their progress. <br /> <br /> The performance in this film is completely rivets from start to finish. All the actors give performances as if this is the right mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. It may well be that the judges can recall back to the beginning of the year when this film is released. The characters are also very well developed. Not only do the filmmakers give a clear and clear reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they succeed in their rocket control. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the character, especially the father, who is bent on eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie loses some of its momentum in the midst of a silly, recycled romantic plot with Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type becomes so much common in high school movies, not that this movie is aimed at high school students. The actors are staring at each other in mind as they are in trance. I set it up without complaining in 1997's "Inventing the Abbots", but I just got enough of this. <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With an authentic-looking period, movies worth an Oscar and real-life clip Homer and end-of-life friends who all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first amazing movie from 1999. > <br />
