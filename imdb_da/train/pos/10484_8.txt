Charming doesn't even begin to describe "Save Grace". It is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who enters this movie will leave with their breathing high (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are getting worse. Her dear departure has left her without money and outstanding debt. Over to lose everything, she has to find a way to get a lot of money ... fast! She gets an idea when her gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks the city-famous gardener to advise him on a plant he secretly grows. Grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana, so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of high-quality weeds and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debt. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable quality of "Saving Grace" is its similarity. Each character is extremely sympathetic, and during the first 20 or so minutes, the film is unhindered good cheer. Everyone wants a happy end for everyone, even if it means blind eyes to some rather illegal activities. The action is top-notch. Brenda Blethyn is one of Britain's finest actresses, and here's why. She turns around what could have been a caricature for a living and breathing individual. She is a lovely lady, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is as gracious as Matthew. He is a deadly loser, but he is so sweet that it doesn't matter. The rest of the ensemble cast also fits in this category, but special mention should go to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat on him, and it suits him well, but he also has good comedy sciences. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's all about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all energy seems to be drained out of the movie. Not so here. The film is thoroughly sympathetic and always entertaining. It's not to say that "Saving Grace" is just a gentle movie that will leave you a laugh and a good feeling. While this movie is not an out and about comedy, it boasts two or three scenes that are not hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with the movie, the climax is a bit confusing. The questions are answered, however, and the end boasts an unexpected twist. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace", especially when you have a bad day.
