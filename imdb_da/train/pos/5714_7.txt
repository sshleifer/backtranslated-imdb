I was so excited to watch this movie because I had always heard it was very scary. What is interesting about it is that it is a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it in Japan with the original crew member! I think it made the movie ... more Japanese (which is probably enough to be quite successful as opposed to most American horror movie flops), but it also made it somewhat inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture was felt throughout the film. This worked well in moments when they thought of catching the protagonist's nervous fear: a scared fish in a big, busy, unknown, Tokyo dam. <br /> <br /> The story was also confusing. In a typical Japanese way, it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually in the middle of history, and from there we constantly move back and forth until we see the end and the beginning of the whole story at the end of the film. This constant turn throughout time was very confusing to me. I also didn't think some things were explained so well, and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel that apparently reveals more of the story). <br /> <br /> All in all, there is plenty for American audiences to love, lots of freaky pictures and macabre details like a healthy splash of bouncy scenes.
