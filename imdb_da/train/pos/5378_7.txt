This is an interesting little flip made in 1967 with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that makes you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's cheesy fun. I saw many similarities between this and 'Creature with the Blue Hand' (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! Scotland Yards finest examines the murders of young ladies in a college. Seems that criminals are detached from a local prison to bid for an evil person and then returned when their work is completed. There is a beautiful device hidden inside a bible that sprays prussic acid, and there is another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine, it resembles a large spray gun, and the victim must be rather closely soaked before they expire . Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and chews mostly chewing gum and looks into the distance. There is a "monk" and how someone identifies this thing as a "monk" is beyond me, it wears a whip and dresses in a red dress with a red cap, more of a clan member in a different color from a monk. There are all kinds of smart devices like a fire hardener going up and down to admit the monk, and it just steps across the fire without breaking its mantle, a nifty trick right there. This is a strange combo of crime drama with greasy overtones, and while it's pretty stupid at times it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
