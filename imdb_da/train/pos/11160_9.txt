This is really the biggest Swedish movie all the time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narrative, but it is also among the first films that have the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film really puts it on the screen. "Adult people" is a warm-hearted and fun story of adulthood, and the question of whether we would be better off without it.
