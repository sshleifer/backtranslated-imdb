I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. The film depicts the war horror in a way that Hollywood usually glosses over. The relationship between the soldiers in the two belligerent countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that at last we are not all completely different on the inside. If you can find any copy of this - buy or rent it. You won't be disappointed, just awful.
