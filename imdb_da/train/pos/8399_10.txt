Love Trap is not short, it is clearly a full length feature film with a run time of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I write this, I might as well speak a little more about Love Trap. I am often asked what makes Love Trap different ... How do I answer that question: 1) It introduces characters - one in particular - that has never been seen before in film, period. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love and delves deeper into the very concept of love than any other American movie ever made in my humble opinion. 3) Structurally as in the way the story is told, it is in contrast to any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It provides extremely timely insight into various cultural issues both within and outside the black community. <br /> <Over time, people will see Love Trap as much as an original work as possible in this era, wonderfully refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare moral game full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate info on this movie.
