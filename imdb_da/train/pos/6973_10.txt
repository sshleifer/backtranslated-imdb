BSG is one of my most popular TV series. I was lucky enough to start seeing what the series came to its last season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what a fantastic trip it was! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was right after the title - Caprica! Although some things do not add when comparing both series, it is still beautifully executed. There was no mention of holobands in Battlestar Galactica or mention of virtual worlds, but perhaps I haven't got far enough for the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternative fantasies in our world. This show is very interesting and wants you to see more!
