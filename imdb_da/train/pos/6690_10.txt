Mystery But is one of the movies that will be more fun over time. There is a naive innocence and "niceness" to the characters. It has become part of our "culture" family, and we often cite the characters. It's my favorite movie the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this movie. Fantastic plays and comedy. We also love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks. Okay, we're not talking intellectually here, just family bonding!
