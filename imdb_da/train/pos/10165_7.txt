In fact, my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has the fun parts that make it worth seeing, don't misunderstand me, is not the world's funniest movie, and it's not even the original because it's an idea we've seen other movies in the past, But this one has its own taste, one of my friends told me that this was a movie for lovers ... I don't think so, but who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same subject, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, one is a very funny movie, see both if you want, and I know you Agrees that Mr. Rock won with his movie I would like the protagonist male character to be given to Ashton Kutcher, but the movie is good.
