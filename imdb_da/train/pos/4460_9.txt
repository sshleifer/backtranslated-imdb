Oh, a Kelly / Sinatra sailing suit musically. So known, right? Yes, but that's not what you normally hear about. On the town there is a road. But if you stick, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two seafarers about a three or four-day vacation. Joe is "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, the book type, asks Joe to get him a "lady". Now, after being picked up by the coppers, they get some Donald home. This is where they meet Susie, the tempting one, the Jezebel. Just for fun! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is he right Or is he a moron? Or is he just misunderstood by society? Find out all this and much more when you see {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but bad, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
