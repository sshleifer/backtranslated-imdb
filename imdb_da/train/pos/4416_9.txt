Harvey Keital's best performance to date the new century. Very nicely photographed, a beautiful snapshot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story is about the nephew of a local minor crime chief who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It really is about the moment a boy awakens the fact that the small circle of people he knows is actually living in a much larger and more complex world that he does not yet understand. The writing is strong and full of humor, the direction is sharp. Above all, a really professional work that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The one weakness is the decision to shoot in synchronized English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this just makes the movie a little less convincing. But if you can look beyond this, you will find a hearty trip to another world. Recommended.
