I have repeatedly said that if people do not want remakes or followers made, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film. When I have said that, although I last saw an independent film, I must have been easily six months ago. So here's a review for an indie that I had my attention drawn to Youtube; Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, you can tell that the movie goes for an avant-garde movie approach that is telegraphed using extreme close-ups, scopophilia, and quick editing. It is proud of the way it looks - and it has the right to be. For the most part, it is a very nicely composed little piece, with the purpose of saving on an incomparable breach of the 180 degree rule and a comical bad shot effect, which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self-financed projects. <br /> <despite these amateurish errors, the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to watch. We are presented with a good use of props and places, good visual actors and some very atmospheric, fluid processing, which is made more legitimate as it is certainly something you will not often see from a Youtube submission. The reason is fragmented, and although the basic premise is quite simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we see here is avant-garde narrative at work. You can't really expect a fair wood structure, and if you do, you may not be ready for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie has failed. What you want to hear throughout is a distorted voice-over that often sounds scary and worse still is the continuing background music that goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything. So much emphasis is placed on the images that sound is soundly neglected, and it becomes really clear when you realize that you have just missed four sentences of the story and have to back up to get what glowed past your attention. <Br /> <br /> Give it a clock, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; was anyone else reminded of the cover for Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel "Last Human" early in the film? If you have the book, you know what I mean.
