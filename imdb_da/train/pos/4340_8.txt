I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I hadn't seen any reviews, etc. It was lovely and a bit of a "romp". I don't know why it didn't do more of a splash than it did. As far as the story goes, I could relate to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character, and I could "see my father" in Falk's character. Did me remember many previous times when I was a kid and listened to my grandparents too. If you've had movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, it's your movie. A "sleeping", in my opinion, and one of those emotional stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles, but nothing was overdone. I would say it rates at least an 8, maybe higher.
