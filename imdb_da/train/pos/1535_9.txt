Fortunately, as a student, I have been able to see the "Diagnosis Murder" for a number of years now. It is basically a doctor who solves murder with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM delivered 8 seasons of unusual entertainment. What made it different from the many other cops and worth seeing many times was its caste and the quality of writing. The main role gave good performances, and Dick Van Dykes entertainment roots shone through with magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were the fast pace, witty scripts and of course the tip of the toe. Unfortunately, it has been unfair to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is far superior to more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of emotional, family-friendly cop shows. Now there are just depressing 'gritty' ones.
