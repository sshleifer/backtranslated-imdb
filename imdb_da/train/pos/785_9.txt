I am of Irish origin, loved this movie, not only was the guy warm and fun he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he fell in love with, she was also beautiful. They were such a sweet couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, it reminds us of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, look prime. Same story line young guy falls for older women, older women fall for young guy. A lot of trails cross in the end the best decision is made or the task is completed. Didn't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie, even though I thought the French guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Umm ... If you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends" that the movie is so good. Quick quote, you might not get unless you see it "Well, it's my dinner ruined." LAUGH OUT LOUD
