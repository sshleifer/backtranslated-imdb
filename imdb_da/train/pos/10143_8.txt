This was a fantastic episode, one of the best of both seasons. Down right horror for a change, with a story that is far above the average MOH episodes if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burnt to death in a tragic car wreck where he drove. His airbag worked, she didn't. She is burned without recognition (great makeup btw) and does not get much chance of living without a full skin graft. BUT even in a coma she continues to die but returns with modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost looks like a great revenge. Of course, Carnage follows, and also some extremely gory killings, and also some very sexy scenes. What more could you ask for, please ask? Well, not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on the faces of most viewers. I just loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction too, he has a good ability to be horror. Excellent episode, this is one I buy safely.
