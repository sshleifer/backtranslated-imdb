This movie is a rebellion. I can't remember the last time I had such a good time in the cinema. I've seen a couple of good comedies in my time, and they're usually pretty funny. But this is wall to wall beautiful lines. I think the Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Apart from that, it is a constant barring of a liners and goofy situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because it's like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. <br /> <br /> As far as the actual movie goes, it could have used better editing, it's rude at times, but we must be forgiven for that. All the characters are great. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be fun and everyone else is around him and is the ham of the ham. I think I will remember all the main characters in the years to come, because they are all so nice. No victims in this movie. Also, thank goodness, they got a 45-year-old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a girlfriend in this movie. You just want women like her really existed. She is not a "10" like any of the other leading ladies, but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie, you can't think too much about it. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre. <br /> <br /> One more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve, and at the end of the year they do not put them on their list. That means you Ebert !!!
