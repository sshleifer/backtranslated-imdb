I was initially questionable about this movie (only because of the subject), but the richly drawn figures, the amazing scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it worth seeing. I originally had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they were increasingly advancing. I'm still haunted by the final scene.
