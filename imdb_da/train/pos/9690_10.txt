Paulie was sweet, cool, enjoyable and quite satisfying. I went to this movie expecting to see a typical "family" movie, one that within moments would find me unconsciously and dull on the floor. My mind changed immediately when I was quickly absorbed in the health of the film. It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be designed as "healthy". Most are cheaply made, written and produced solely for attracting young family members, who will then draw the unfortunate elders into a mind that cushions 65 minutes of overused vision and reasons. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Paulie had a reason. It told the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who could talk incredibly and quite often held conversations with her. Marie's dorky jerk father found this incredible and believed Paulie to be detrimental to his 4-year-old daughter's mental health and quickly tore them apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he tries to reunite his beloved owner and meet many memorable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie could really (smartly) speak and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The grounds were thick and entertaining throughout, and kept me attracted. Paulie is the best family movie I've found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. Nobody sleeps. I promise.
