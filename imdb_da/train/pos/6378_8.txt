Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, smoothest animations and wisely written dialogue of any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced for the first 15 minutes. I especially love Don Novello's vocal work on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad the whole movie seems to be moving about twice the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first action. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - as Atlantis does not provide. He is average at best. Halfway through the movie there is a mediocre twist. That's all. It's a great movie anyway. Everyone should check it out.
