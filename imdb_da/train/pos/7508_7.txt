Great acting from Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics to hit the screen for a while. While it covers most of Bettie's young life, it also manages to remain on a most focused path, something that most biographical films seem to lack. There is some nice and alarming fun subtitle in dialogue and acting. This movie is an excellent break from Dir. by "American Psycho" and I think this will turn out to be her best work to date. Oh, and as a movie, I give this movie 100% in cine dept. It was amazing how well they pulled out a 50's look with modern movie stores. Congratulations on D.O.P. Everything around very pleasant. I recommend anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
