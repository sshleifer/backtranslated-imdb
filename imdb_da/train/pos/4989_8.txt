This is very dated, but it is part of the charm of this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most Pre-Code movies; they are just different, and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was a short while, Spencer Tracy's great play and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young's character that enabled me to see and enjoy You will be hard pressed to find a nicer girl than "Trinna" played by 20-year-old Young, who was already making his 50th movie! (She started acting like a young child. It and the fact that they made movies back in the old days.) The camera, although it was soft focus throughout the film, zoomed in on Loretta's face and eyes many times, and I was fascinated by her beauty. </ p> <p> <p> By playing a crotchety man with a cynical perspective on life, Tracy's "Bill" was slowly transformed into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting. Although they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell give lasting impressions long after watching this 75-minute movie. I was particularly fascinated by Connolly's role as the camp ministers / grandfather. <br /> <br /> The story is a little removed but hey - it's the movies. This story is about two lonely major depression victims trying to survive in a "Hooverville" -type camp, and it gets up to being a very touching tale.
