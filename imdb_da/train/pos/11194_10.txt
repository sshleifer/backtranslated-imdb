Poor script, poor direction, over the best performances, overshadowed dialogue. What more could you ask for? For laughs it just doesn't get any better than this. Zadora's over-acting combined with the clipped scenarios, she finds herself creating a hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as fun as "Spinal Tap", though clearly not calculated as such. Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut movie line, "Looks like a penis."
