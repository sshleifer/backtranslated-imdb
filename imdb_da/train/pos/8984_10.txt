I first saw this movie when I flipped through the movie channels on my parents DirecTV. It was on the Sundance Canal and had just started. I love music, especially late 60s, and that's what BJM sounded like (The Dandys is okay). Everything about Brian Jonestown Massacre fascinated me from the music, to Anton and Joel's personalities, to the illegal drug use. It was fun because when I saw the first party scene when everyone was making my parents, they passed by and decided to watch (the appearance of their faces was invaluable). Anyways it's definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band all the time. <br /> <br /> Just watch it ... seriously
