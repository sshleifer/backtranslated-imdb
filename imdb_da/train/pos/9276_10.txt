The US State Dept did not like us to watch this movie because they have a beef with the Iranian government. But it just shows us how civilized Iran really is, despite the film's content, which centers on women's struggle for equal rights in the simplest terms: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, which is strictly limited to male audiences alone. The film is hilarious fun and in itself is evidence of freedom of expression and freedom of expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensively. Five girls are trying to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates of a football game between Iran and Bahrain. The subsequent comedy is for fun to describe from bus travel to the stadium to police interference and subsequent detention of the girls to the resulting end. Don't miss this classic movie. Its a must see. One of the best foreign films I've seen this year.
