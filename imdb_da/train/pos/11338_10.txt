I saw this on "Dances with Films" and it was amazing. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only will your parents divorce but there is a monster after you. <br /> <br /> It was both fervent and scary - there were several moments when the audience screamed in real fright. It reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> That's what separated "Jake's Closet" from the usual indy movie pabulum - an excellent script with compelling characters. Also, by mixing elements of the horror movie with family drama, the film gets the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't come out in theaters, definitely get the DVD.
