"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have animals to tame, but Europeans did and it stands out why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasons behind this documentary or the original book. You must not destroy this great piece of your simple thinking. The reasons are far more complex than the one you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I enjoyed it very much. This book is even a teaching as a textbook in some universities.
