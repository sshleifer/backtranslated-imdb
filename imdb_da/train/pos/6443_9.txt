Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me by a roast several weeks ago. I have never seen or even noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) into the "Swedish Movie" category, and those who ascended (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of foreign films. Hell what a paradigm shift! The movie touches me because it just keeps my hope that humanity can switch to a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas of the earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, hidden brutality, but also the ability to have fun meeting, singing ... It Take a trigger from outside to tear off the stitches from everyone (who holds one) and let them feel that we are all just people with a desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this, because it keeps my hopes up as described above. The five minutes containing the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, is one of my movie highlights ever! Thank you Kay Pollak just for those 5 minutes, which made me happy!
