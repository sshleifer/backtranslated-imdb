Okay, I must admit that I have never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Although I don't know anything about this duo of comic talent, I still liked this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose tries her luck at being a comedian. Rhoda is struggling with a photographic career. And Meredith ... what is she doing again? These three stories we follow over two hours are entertaining and entertaining in their own way. When the two long friends return, it only makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how good the writing was. The little jokes thrown in by Mary and Rhoda were fun. The script itself was very well put together. <br /> <br /> I watched Moore and Harper in other movies over the last few years and thought they were very good. But I did not know that they worked well as a team. While both actresses do their part to fulfill the title of this movie, they never seem to let me fall. (During this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles okay, but nothing big. The rest of the cast as Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone else works well together. <br /> <br /> For this to be a reunion, you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this. From a non-fan I ever enjoyed this little get-together. Good stories for each character and the two main characters are what makes this movie very good. (The newer version of the MTM theme song does not hurt either).
