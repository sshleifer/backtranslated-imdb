The original Vampires (1998) are one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work as they didn't use any of the original characters. I was totally surprised at how this played out. Successors are usually never as good as the original with a few exceptions. Although this was not a good movie, the author did well to keep the main topics & vampire lore from the first in line. Jon Bon Jovi was a disadvantage at first, but he turned out to be a half decent slayer. I doubt anyone could survive James Wood's performance in the first, though ... unless you bring in Buffy! All in all, this was a decent watch and I would see it again. <Br /> <br /> I was left with two questions, though ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a slayer? Guess we have to leave it for imagination.
