"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with a single touch." As soon as I first heard it, my attention was locked on the trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern Fairy Tale that brings my Spirits up and keeps my attention throughout the show. I think Acting and Casting is just perfect, every character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique feeling, from the beekeeper to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to let me fall. And the deaths that will normally lead to a depressing moment are often purely comical (as an explosive scratch & sniff book). Even with the huge amount of criminal shows we now have a few days, daisies are one of the few who really stand out from the rest is not just a mystery, but a love story, comedy and an adventure with a hint of drama that everyone is baked in a wonderful pie ..... erroneous show. What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC, This year I had no reason to turn to ABC, but this brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But just after two seasons, a couple of awards, A Large Fan Base and Positive Responses from Critics have been knocked down. It seems that Ned has Touched ABC again and forever killed it for me. I will always be a fan of this show though, and I recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they see.
