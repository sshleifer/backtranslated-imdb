The version I saw in this movie was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a hard word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun as hell. It was also true for the leg. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the area around it, you'll understand humor. If not, you can't 'get it' at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the company struggles to make it until they finally reach a break, it's a rare gem. It's a drama, but it's a drama as much as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful as always as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to hold her own well. His performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only drawback was Carmen Electra, but we can't have everything.
