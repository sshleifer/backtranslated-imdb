Don't expect a description of the "truth". However, the bookkeepers of these veterans of the Iraqi and Afghan wars demand thoughtful consideration. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the movie is that it portrays vividly the words and war years of these weapons and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My major criticism of the movie is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism, but no more to rectify the serious flaws of military and veterans affairs programs to help them who has suffered and still suffers the war traumas. It's not fatal mistakes in the movie. As a veteran myself, I know that the horrible pursuit of war is real, and these young men and women formulate it very well. These veterinarians describe the living physical and mental pain and pain that most veterans experience and which ordinary people need to understand, because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
