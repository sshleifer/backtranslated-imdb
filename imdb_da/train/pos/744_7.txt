"Foxes" is a movie I remember for the depiction of teenagers in the late 1970s. As I am actually Jodie Foster's age, I related to this movie. It is about frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of youth. The soundtrack is good with inspiring stones, eg. "More than a Feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music from my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this even though it wasn't huge.
