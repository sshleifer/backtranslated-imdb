An excellent movie about two police who love the same woman. One of the police (Périer) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand does not know who is the other lover who could have killed her, and Périer does not know that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must definitely find the killer ... and what a great end! Highly recommended.
