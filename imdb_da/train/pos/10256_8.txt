The first part of this infamous horror series is presented as if it were a snus movie discovered by the producers and created as an amateur tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It shows that a woman is kidnapped by a gang of black-dressed men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The unfortunate victim is hit hard and the fur with raw meat before she has fingernails with seaweed, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle and so on. <br /> <br /> In the most nauseating scene, the woman's captives burn her with hot water and release live stomachs into the fires. The series received a great deal of publicity when US actor Charlie Sheen, who believed the series contained an actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States. An FBI study showed that the films were just what they seemed to be for most viewers - ill recreation through unpleasant but obvious special effects. Gruesomely staged by the renowned Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this movie is a sure way to clear everyone but the most tolerant spaces. But gorhounds will probably not find anything special.
