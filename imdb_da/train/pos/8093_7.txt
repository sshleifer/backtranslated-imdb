My friend had the idea of ​​seeing the animated LOTR after seeing Peter Jackson Return of The King. So I finally bought it from e-bay and thought right from the start that it should suck. In fact, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made Frodo's voice sounded like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but believe me, I've seen much worse. It jumps quite a few things as both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into a two-hour movie. Definatley worth seeing, kids might like, but still absoutley no comparison with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
