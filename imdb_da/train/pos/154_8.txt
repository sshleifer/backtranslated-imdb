"El Mar", directed by Catalan director Agusti Villarona and based on the novel by Blai Bonet, gives a glimpse of Spanish history as seen by a Balearic writer who takes the viewer back to the days of civil war in the country. The film concentrates on three friends and follows them from the early days of the war in Mallorca, a few years later, when two of these friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. <Br /> <br /> First, we meet three boys who play happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of the one who commits the evil deed. The boys have excluded a young girl from their age from participating in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet the adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanatorium. He seems to suffer from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his boys' boys, and the young girl who was not welcomed to participate in their games, is now one of the nuns who oversee their health care. It is clear that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the hard bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a great job of portraying the elderly Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino gives an impression as Tour, the vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, exhibits as Carmen, wife of the institution's caretaker. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona's talents as the novel comes alive to the viewer.
