This movie could only come from the 1970s !! It's a bizarre action movie set in a small California worker town. A kind of mill or plant shuts down, so suddenly there is a violent bad behavior on the street! The city's people are tired! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam Know that looks and works a little without balance. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam veterinarian. They enter the city to clean up (they become deputies), but during their good deeds they actually run gambling houses and ask for protection money etc. !!! It takes a while for people to catch on, and in a Biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent must assume his elder brother. There is an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere for this movie, making it interesting (note the cock-fighting scene!). Vincent is almost too English in this role ?? He thinks so highly of his brother, he cannot imagine that he commits the evil deeds he is accused of. He finally comes to his senses ?? his boyfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back and he is himself raised in his home. Kris Kristofferson is scary as Aaron. He denies the cold something wrong and even gently talks and speaks to Vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as "uncle Aaron"), though he threatens his father's life, smiles all the time! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a "saloon" girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good 70s action movie if you can find it !! It is NOT available on DVD yet?
