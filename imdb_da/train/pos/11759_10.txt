The Best of Times is one of the greatest scammers of all time. The setup does not tax your patience, the development is stable, the many interrelated relationships are lovingly established, gags and bits work everything and everyone is fun. There is lots of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower puts in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee's safe foot as ever. The cast also contains many good followers. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, how many times I've enjoyed it, and how often I wish more people could see it.
