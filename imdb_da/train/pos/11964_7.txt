I went to the cinema this afternoon and expect to be underwhelmed by Scoop. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's not something heavy, nothing deep - and not just as good as any number of genuine Allen masterpieces - but it's also fun as a light, pondering comedy. There is something kind of simple and sweet about it. "Sweet" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they went out after the show. It doesn't feel like Allen set up to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he would make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to almost everything Hollywood produces, Allen's stuff tends to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. These days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by a real person.
