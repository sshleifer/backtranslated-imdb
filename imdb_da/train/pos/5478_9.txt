No sense goes over history, as enough reviewers have done so. Here are a few different slopes on it from one of these "religious nuts", as a bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) perhaps offers the classic example ever put on film about how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: look cute, smash your eyelashes, offer your body for free ..... and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was job progress with the ultimate goal of money ..... lots of it. At least four men in this movie give just that, even though it destroys their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many reviewers here seem to hate - gives another big message: All the money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel satisfied. A sad comment that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages and prefer to cheat over matter. No surprise, I think. <br /> <br /> Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish, and Stanwyck has some great lines, especially at the beginning, telling her raw father and his troubled bar customers. In just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.
