I watched this movie in the bad hours of the morning when I had to sleep. This was in itself testimony to the fact that Discipline was a spell-binding film. I think Boorman did a wonderful job of leading this movie. How academically was the early stage with the hill folk and dueling banjos done. It turned out so well and early where inherently reserved and single people in the area were. The point in point - near the end of the "duel" smiled the banjo boy (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the child was reserved to respond. The river trip never left you bored, for sure. The rape scene was brutal but necessary to show just what the group was opposed to in this backwoods area of ​​Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock was well done afterwards. Some have said he was quite unaffected by the trial. I disagree - if you really were aware, he did not answer the whole action immediately after Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased the toothless guy. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later on top of the rock. It almost turned out that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize that the arrow he had shot earlier was finally in effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, and I was a fan of an 8 and 9 in my voice, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter giving it a "1", I gave it and "10". This person's mindset seemed to be based on personal pretension rather than an objective point of view, and his voice was apparently a non-correlating attempt to lower judgment.
