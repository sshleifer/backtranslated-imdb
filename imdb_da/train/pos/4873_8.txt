For those of you who are not aware of the theme that Kusturica continues to investigate intermittently in its films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible for you to understand his stories. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has chosen to mandate. Since its amazing work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's film is 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This' emphasized his slapstick-carnivalist style of 'westernization' of the Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and attack on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradox of contrast (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) is contrasting. The city's world reflects Western attributes that have depicted the spatial and temporal attitude; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a burst of sense of identity and violent breach of traditional values ​​- as expressed to the young child - villager. The end of the movie is an example of this concept as we observe a funeral and wedding on a one-way gravel road. They are in a collision rough; Suitably, the wedding, which represents the life line and the pulse of the village, ie, breaks the wedding. traditional values, to collide with the funerals, which exemplify the death of tradition in this context. But Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through its own unique stylistic singularity. With its outrageous and flamboyant style, it serves as a vehicle in its depiction.
