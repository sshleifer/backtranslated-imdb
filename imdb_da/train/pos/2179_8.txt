The Prix de Beauté was made on the shift of transition from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a quiet, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress who spoke Louise Brooks' lines, but was released as a quiet in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate enough to see Cineteca di Bologna's flawless new restoration of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not yet seen the talkie version, but I think it is safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, since in all reports the duplication is poorly done (Louise Brooks is obviously English, so there is no way, her Lips can be matched.) Also, the film is made entirely in style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. The Prix de Beauté visually tells its story with exciting, imaginative camera work. The opening is instantly kinetic, with fast-cut scenes in city life and swimmers spraying on a public beach. Throughout the film, emphasis has been placed on visual details, on clothes, machines, decoration and symbolic images, such as a caged bird, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is silent film technology at its peak. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louise Brooks is responsible for saving the movie from blur. Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last major role. Brilliant beautiful, she dominates the movie with her charisma and also gives a completely natural but high charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst movies, for which she is best known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typewriter with a possession fiancé who longs to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success. She is so torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she gives it all or loses him. All characters are drawn with shade. The fiance inspires compassion and is not just a brutal one: he loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who cannot cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting other men's attention. Even the "other man" in the story is not the simple slim ball we first take him to, even though his intentions might as well be as the fiance's. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has many fine sets of pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" competition, shown through the comic reactions of various audiences who pelting heroine with flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the cocour's pendulum marks time behind her; a nightmare trip to a fun fair (in the silent version this happens late in the film after her marriage), where Lucienne, crushed among the Lives and depressed by her husband's macho antics, decides she cannot go ahead with her current existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where she looks at her talkie screen test. Louise Brooks can never have looked more beautiful than she does here, with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white fur, her face glowing under the black hair heart, which she looks at singing on the screen. The double shot of his exquisite body and her still vivid image on the screen is particularly exciting: Louise Brooks' image, as Lucienne, remains immortal despite its frustratingly killed movie career.
