This movie is SOOOO fun !!! The action is amazing, Ramones is sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing at his school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This movie is a little bit "cool" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are comfortable; You can even find yourself singing these songs when the movie is through. This musical ranks number two in musicals for me (other off the blues brothers). But please don't think of it as a musical pr. to see how the songs are so cozy, it's hard to tell that a carefully choreographed scene takes place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. You will be reminded of how it was to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will recall your old colleges after watching this movie. Highly recommended for both the family (as it is a very youthful, but also for adults, as there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
