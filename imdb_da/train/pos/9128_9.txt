I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest culprits. Little Rain broke not only borders, it put a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I still lose little rain soundtrack and pretend to be the prince and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie itself, I was just thinking what I said in the title because for the most part, this movie itself is made by the music. The play? Don't let me judge it, as this is one of my favorite delights, for I know it was not worthy of Oscar in any way. But I think the duo who took this movie was Morris and Jarome, their talk about passwords was just beyond fun. I just want to judge this movie on the concert sequences because I felt it was what made the movie. Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. While the movie and play are pretty bad, this movie is still fun to watch at night and even dance too. This movie defined the 80s, so just have fun with it. Prince wants it that way, just to party down! Oh, boy, who sounded lama. <br /> <br /> 9/10
