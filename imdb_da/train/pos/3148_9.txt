I love this show. Period. I haven't looked very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it's now my favorite program and will probably be for a while. I love all the characters, except I don't care about Donna. I'm not quite sure why. I just can't find her fun, and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Apart from her, I find the rest of the throw pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric's parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I didn't quite hate the 8th season. I still look at it and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to the shows of earlier seasons, it's not that good. Randy is horrible. The final was decent, nothing great, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but good. I have the fourth season on DVD, and today I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of her most hilarious episodes were, in my opinion, 'Your & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I've seen so far, which is most of them, me. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
