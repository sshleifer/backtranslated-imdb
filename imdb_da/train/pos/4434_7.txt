It is not sophisticated and no one in the credits had a good career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities; the movie seems more realistic than some high budget, well-cast movies. <br /> <br /> A movie made for a few bucks it is worth watching should give hope to anyone who would be filmmakers and wild players. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it was made in the worst possible time. TV took over the film industry's revenue and this movie could easily have been shown on television. In 1950, the entire ticket price on TV qualified for a "G" rating. The film industry began to make several "adult" films that could not be shown on television during the days when television would not dare to display sex and skin in today's commercials.
