Before I watched this movie, I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I've seen before. As for sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that sexual scenes of Dreamquest would be good as Flashpoint sexual scenes, but I was disappointed. Apart from Asia's Carrera's sexual scene, I get no sense of sexual scene in this movie (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson does not do the kinds of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both lovely girls disappoint me as good as sexual scenes are concerned. Although it is an adult movie, but if you remove the sexual scene factor, this movie is very good. In the case of typical adult film standards, this film definitely raised the standard for adult movies. History, action, direction, set, makeup and other technical things in this movie are really good. The actors in this movie have done really good plays, they have all done a good job. Dreamquest is surely raised by the quality of adult movies.
