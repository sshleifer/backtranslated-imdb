My family has seen Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie first came out. We have saved most lines. I saw it two weeks ago and still tickled on the simple humor and view of life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as a side scoop - even though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fiancee house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father are side spiders. The line from the butler, "Will you wait for the library" followed by Arthur's answer: "Yes, I wanted the bathroom out of the question" is my NEWMAIL message on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny thing "!
