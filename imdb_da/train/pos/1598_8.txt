Either I or I love the suspension of any formal plot in this movie. I have visited it many times and it always keeps up. A little too stylized for some, but I want every opera lover to love it. Norman Jewison, one with Canadian, takes tremendous chances with his films and his casting, and it almost always pays in movies that are out of the center and somehow delicious as this is. I have often wondered about Cher's acting role, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life, or she does not get enough roles to chew on. I have found her to be a great actress who can retire in a role as in this particular or be tall and bold and hard as in "Mask". I found the comic lines at times (a hairdresser called "Cinderella"), but it was the intent of both the author and the director. Nicolas Page plays the anxiety ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point requiring a knife to split his neck. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, like opera. All in all, a very satisfying film, not to everyone's taste at a long shot, I loved the end, all brought together as a Greek choir, each part subtly nuanced and mixed with the others, the camera pulls down into the hall and left the players talking . 8 out of 10
