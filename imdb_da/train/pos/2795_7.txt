I love to play football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie, and I'm glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and that was also Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was good at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn to cook, and she wants her to get married. When jazz starts playing for a football team in secret, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is her coach. When her parents find out the problems, but her father lets her play the big fight at her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi) wedding. In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
