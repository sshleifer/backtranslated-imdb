This is a docudrama story about the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. It especially looks at the problem of insinuation, gossip and expectations when dealing with real dramas. One problem that history is about is how people are expected to give the same emotional response to similar situations. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysteria for any major crisis. Just because the characters in the movies and the TV work in a certain way, there is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially suitable for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the big sobscene that will draw the scores. It is a problem that needs to be treated constantly. <br /> <br /> The wires play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are strongly supported by a large cast of all players based on factual people. Some viewers may be surprised to know that many of the supporters in this story are people better known in Australia as comics. It reiterates my idea that comics do some of the best support in dramas because they with comedy know how to create quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; that I am actually a former Adventist who was a practicing member of Australia at the time of this incident; so I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it's handled with great creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple is hounded by the new choppers. It captured the themes of history brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character they could". Although this is especially suited to this story, I also believe that it is also a general principle that also applies to everyone.
