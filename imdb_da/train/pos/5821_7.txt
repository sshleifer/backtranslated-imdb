I was quite surprised to read some of the comments about this work honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? OK, when this video came out over a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It doesn't have a plot or a central story. It is a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos, all of which are smart or creative. Michael Jackson can be considered a freak these days, but it was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video all the time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and the artists who collaborated with him took his music and dance movements again to create live entertaining things that included claymation, special effects, live performance footage and even self-parody (the "Badder" sequence). And for those who wonder what Joe Pesci did there, this video came out a bit before becoming a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. And IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats something else, Michael Jackson made up for that point!
