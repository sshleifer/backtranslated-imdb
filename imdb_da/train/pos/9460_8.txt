I loved the story. Somewhere a poster said that there are no families like the one portrayed in this movie. Now there must be. I thought everyone seemed really human and trustworthy. What a top notch thrown. What good music on the soundtrack. What a lovely this and what a lovely thing, but most of all, I would say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. He was really commander like a widow who had dedicated himself perhaps a little too much to being a good father first, at the expense of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Has he acted like a petulant ass? Why, yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what was perfect with this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe he was FEELING something and not just seemed to feel anything, and he conveyed me perfectly what it was that he felt and what he felt was denied. <br /> <br /> Denied happiness. <br /> <br /> Refused fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is painful without faith, and many who do so will never feel such a thing again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave it an eight out of ten.
