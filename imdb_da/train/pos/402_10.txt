I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this movie, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the legend of Zu looks like another dimension !! Thanks to Tsui Clark's extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to portray his view of mountains floating over the clouds, a land where creatures fly freely, and forces range from razor-sharp wings, split swords and the ultramole Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> While there are many signs in this one, the focus is primarily on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic aspect is there, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful, and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth seeing. In the beginning I like how she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she plays well with Enigma as she deals with her past life. Oh, by the way, do I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had several comedy elements, and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in the cinema.
