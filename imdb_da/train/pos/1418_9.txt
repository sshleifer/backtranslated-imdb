I hardly went to see this movie because I remember the penguin's March was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I saw it at the opening weekend, but after I saw it, it was simply amazing; The fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth your money. You also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of, how our lives have deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a mortal or triumphant environmentalist to appreciate the only awesomeness of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and the miracle of life. Enjoy!
