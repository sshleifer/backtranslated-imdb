Anyone who does not laugh all through this movie has become balm. I've seen it at least twenty times, and I still get tears in my eyes on many of the scenes. Sally Field is perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star, whose support is trying to get her replaced in the hope that their own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has the wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that illuminates her having had three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The "Soapdish" cast is filled with stars that perform their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, like Robert Downey Jr., an indie Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as the over-excited casting director, auditioning for an actor for a small part serving without her shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the unimaginable costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is fun. <br /> <br /> This movie would have won the Oscars for Best Comedy, Best Leading Lady in a Comedy, Best Man in a Comedy, and countless other best ones, including writing, managing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over again for the next 25 years. You will still laugh at it when the disc is worn out.
