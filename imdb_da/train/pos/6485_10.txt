World War II is one of the best documentaries on World War II. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries involved in it. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he could build one of the world's strongest armies. They also emphasize the military actions taken during the war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. All of you should see this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
