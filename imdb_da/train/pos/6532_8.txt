I think part of the reason why this movie was made ... and is aimed at players who actually play all Nancy Drew PC games. There have been many movies lately based on video games, and I think this is in one of them. So this movie does not follow any book. But it follows parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. And the games are from Herinteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games have actually won Parents Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun, but you can actually learn something or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my stepchildren with me to see it and they loved it! The 10 years. Old had begun to play his first Nancy Drew game one day before I took her to watch the movie and she had such fun playing the game. I also thought she would enjoy the movie. And I was right ... she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My second step daughter is only 7, and she also loved the movie, but she is still a little too young, also playing the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play sometimes just to watch what happens. The games are based on children 10 years and older. All games usually get beautiful descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games, check out HerInterative Nancy Drew Games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I want to buy it when it comes out on DVD.
