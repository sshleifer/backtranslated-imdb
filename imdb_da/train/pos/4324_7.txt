You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> An earlier review of pninson from Seattle has already identified all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only reinforce his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than his previous work. This is taken literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who piles on the gloom and fogs too much. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear half an hour in the opening section, it's a relief that is just in daylight for the first time. In some of the darker scenes, it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen. I saw it all in one day and started in the middle of the afternoon. As daylight fell it became less of a problem, but I have a good good TV, and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of the day. The pacing is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure this was intentional, but it's exaggerated. There are many shots of people trudging though muck and gloomy by Victorian London, kept longer than necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take several minutes out of every fifty minute episode without losing a dialog just by trimming each of these scenes a little. <br /> <br /> I don't want to overestimate these two issues. You quickly adapt to the look and pace of this production. The more important is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Former Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House, but are not so much intricate. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was thrilled to see how Douglas McGrath crammed an 800-page book into his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of padding. McGrath carries great writings of the novel while still preserving all the essential story elements. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs seven hours. It probably needs even longer because many elements in its collapsed plot are not sufficiently clear or as well handled as they should be. A few random examples will illustrate the problems. The girl, Rosa, comes from nowhere without background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment to her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sergeant Georges consent to Tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of Horton's handwriting is somewhat fudged. It's not clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when she tries to marry John Jarndyce. Nor is it clear that they agree not to disclose their commitment or why. Ada and Rick's secret marriage has been omitted. In one episode, they are only lovers; in the next, people are suddenly referred to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs Rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in history and Sargeant George's feelings from his family are inexplicable - just as it is the means by which she is discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's commitment to maintaining the honor and respect for the Dedlock family is underestimated, so his motive to pursue Lady Dedlock is more unclear than it needs to be. <br /> <br /> It is not clear that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because her cups have anything but gone. <br /> <br /> This is just a choice: there are others. They are not big problems, and the main force of history is clear enough. Nonetheless, the minor irritations that detract from its strength are: You don't have to puzzle over small plot points. But there are more important structural problems that weaken history in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole business with Tulkinhorn's murder is something thrown away. Bucket immediately attacks Hortense as a suspicion that undermines the excitement of Sergeant George's prescription and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell. It also reduces the impact of the subplot, where the suspicion is thrown at Lady Dedlock and weakening the scene where Hortense is unmoved in front of Sir Lester. One more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search on Lady Dedlock dominate the story for more than an hour, during which time we completely lose the second main type: the legal case and its effect on Rick. His failing economy, his grasp of Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining health, and so on, are all put at risk for an entire episode. It may be how Dickens wrote the book (I haven't read it for years), but a good script should keep the different plot strands together. <br /> <br /> Finally, Smallweed's role in history is so diminished that he is almost redundant. His discovery of the new will that triggers the final stage of history is also thrown away. It happens outside the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it's still a very good production. Many of the performances are excellent. Individual scenes are beautifully realized. Its cumulative sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation of a big book if it hadn't been for the 2005 production. In fact, I would probably not be fully aware of its shortcomings if I hadn't seen how Andrew Davies did better. I've been critical of Davies Jane Austen's adaptations, but I have to admit that he really is emptying Dickens exciting books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and gripping drama and worth seven hours of some time. Nevertheless, its likely fate should be seen mainly as a cross reference to the near-final 2005 version.
