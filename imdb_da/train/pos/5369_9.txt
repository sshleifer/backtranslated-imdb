Mild Spoilers <br /> In the near future, Arnold needed stars like Ben Richards, a mistakenly convicted man, to play 'The Running Man', a deadly TV game show where people have to continue to try to escape brutal deaths in the hands of 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to die eventually, and it is up to Arnold to prove the system incorrectly. <br /> <br /> I haven't read Stephen King's book, but it's a great movie, regardless of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the role of the actor and delivers death with unforgettable one-liners. Classics are probably 'he was a real pain in the neck' after choking a guy with barb wire, and 'he had to divide!' Where he referred to where he just missed any vertical. Dawson is quite annoying as a TV presenter, and all of the "Stalkers are suitable camps. The action is violent, but it's an action movie. That is the point. The movie is fast and in 90 minutes it does not exceed its welcome. <br /> <br /> With Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser at the helm and following the success of the Terminator, this movie was probably seen as another mindless action vehicle for Arnold and very far-fetched. But today anyone who sees a lot of TV can see how the film comes closer to reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the television in the near future and see a show that is not far from it. <br /> <br /> However, on the depressing note, I recommend 'The Running Man' to anyone who likes the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
