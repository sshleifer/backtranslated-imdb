I never think to write a review on IMDb unless I'm extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year, I try to see all nominees for best foreign films on the Oscar, even those I know I will not like. "As it is in heaven" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow .... For my taste, which runs more towards original, dark and / or bold foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, Very modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "As it is in Heaven" sounds Not very interesting .... It was not released in the United States, so I sat down to see a VCD I found in Singapore and prepared to "cross it from the list". After a boring start, "as it is in heaven" becomes the rare movie where you really get inspired by what is happening on the screen. Weak points: The characters in the film are pure "stock" characters - The Wounded Dreamer, The City of Bully, The Battered Wife, Loose Woman Yearning for Love, the suppressed minister .... Fortunately, they are largely a sympathetic mass, as well as be well-written and well-acted. Ingela Olsson, whom the minister's wife Inger, would have nominated for an Oscar, had her performance in English. Strong points: The music is beautiful and the most important song sung by Gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable. And watch out for the feisty 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who stops dancing and younger ladies! I do not want to discuss the end, but I would say that makes sense. They are, there are many emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie and you are not quite sure why they happen. Although nothing is explained by words, it makes sense as the movies come to an appropriate crescendo. **** out of *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen.
