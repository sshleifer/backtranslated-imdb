Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biographical movie Patton, follows it with a big tribute to another of American combat generals Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his selfishness. With MacArthur you never knew exactly where to start and the other one went and for many times they mixed. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour movie or a TV mini series. It would cover him from his days at border posts with his family at his time at West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved at a cadet. It would talk about his service in Phillipines as a young officer, his legend building on the battlefields of World War I in France. It would also have to tell of him who fired at the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, likely to put the final kabosh at some chance, President Herbert Hoover had been re-elected. During MacArthurs last year, he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. It must have been a topic they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952, and it is told in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur, addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks with the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the progressive Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his command of President Truman. <br /> <br /> As a movie, MacArthur would not work if it were not for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. That's the part of the movie I enjoyed the best when I saw MacArthur and his relationship with both of these men. The FDR of O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic fate and, exceptionally, the incredible man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and wisdom. Sometimes he liked to spoil a little too much for his own sake, but he was the last politician of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur as both a battlefield manager and potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> The Truman of Flanders is as people remember him, a blunt talking man of the people who did not like MacArthur's arrogance from gitgo. Of course, in the history books, Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was indefinite, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> But I could write a whole treatise on the Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way, it doesn't have to be a crisis. I have always felt that the FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a much better way if he were still president then. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also grandly eloquent, and Gregory Peck captures some of the eloquent in some of the orders that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the congressional gathering, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. See the press and see if you disagree.
