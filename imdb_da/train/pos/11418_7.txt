I first saw this movie during and International Film Studies course. I am a "non-traditional" student, and perhaps because of year-long life or wisdom-accrued appreciated the slow, reflective pacing of the movie's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of a dry cliff is the story deeply psychological, filled with multilayer symbolism and an articulated inversion of the theme of being 'Other' in a country that one does not understand. The understanding that comes is filled with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Almost 20 years ago, it is also a precursor to a genre of several other international films exploring the themes of colonies in colonized spaces that are irrelevant to the nuances of the cultures they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed - - and heavily funded --- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, nowhere in Africa are two, which in comparison might make Chocolat pale and boring. It has no adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence. The fighting is mental, emotional and subtle. But that's said, it's a nice movie, worth a visit.
