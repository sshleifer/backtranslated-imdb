Then you should watch this movie to understand reality. After reading the book, Mrs. Duke is now a lawyer for those affected by bipolar disorder; previously labeled manic depression. It is hard to believe that people of today and age still criticize others with emotional problems or those seeking psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and it is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the audience sees the pain and suffering Mrs Duke had been through, especially as a child. Many of us remember her from the teenager "Patty Duke Show". She was a household name in America for 15 years. <br /> <br /> You learn about her exploitation of Ross' (well played by Howard Hesseman). As she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. However, we see as she goes on in her career, but the disease gets worse. She goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; herself marries someone she differs next week and she has more conflicts and tantrums with her children and older mother. All these problems arose before she received adequate therapy and medication. A recent study published by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) found that a majority of American adults do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of manic depression. It was also released that one in five respondents to the vote believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wished. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "pull up her bootstraps" and "get along" until she was trained on her suffering and got proper treatment. Thank you, Mrs Duke, for being a lawyer against ignorance and prejudice.
