When I began to see "Fay Grim", I had no idea that it was a successor to "Henry Fool". Now the latter was not a movie that I imagined to have a successor. But you have come, and it is quite good. I guess you've seen the original so I won't explain it. This starts with Fay (Parker Posey), who lives with her son, whom she had with deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day, the son is expelled to bring a pornographic toy to school. But it's not a regular toy. It has a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I must say I am totally impressed by what Hal Hartley has achieved here. Perhaps this cannot fully achieve the quality of origin, but it certainly takes a good look at what is going on in the world. And the end allows another successor. <br /> <br /> Also with Jeff Goldblum.
