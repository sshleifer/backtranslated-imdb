This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I've ever seen. It does not attempt to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is dark witty, playful and seriously true to elements of the Jewish tradition and modern written interpretation. Judas is much more common than other depictions, not the dark and vicious evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly wrong man, terribly displeased in his zeal. Chris Sarandens Jesus is bodily and serious, faithful and committed - very human and also divine. The final dialogue is carefully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men can do when they have just committed a cruelty. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
