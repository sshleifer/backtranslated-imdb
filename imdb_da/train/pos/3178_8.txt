The movie "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones evokes the viewer on the return journey, as the protagonist takes back the steering of the steering wheel and puts his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to strengthen his character and actualize what matters most. These truths become evident to both characters and viewers when you laugh and go to the credits with them. The simple yet attractive options costumes keep you guessing what you want to see next. You can't help smiling and laughing at the fakes that take place in this movie. I can't wait for his sophomore efforts. It's just a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
