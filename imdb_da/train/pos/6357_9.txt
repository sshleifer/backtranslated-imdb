I found this a very entertaining little kids movie that is actually geared more to adults with many jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kids, but only a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with all of them, from sexual to cultural to insider Hollywood to race. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and costumes and the hairdresser of the little people here is fun to see. Anthony Hopkins's voice is also comfortable, so having his story raises the film further. His rhyme is fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the theater, even though it was "fair" but on DVD it was far better. I've seen three times, and it got better every time.
