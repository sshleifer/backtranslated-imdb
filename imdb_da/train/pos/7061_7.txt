Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it is made in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was pretty good to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> I liked Cinderella's voice better in this too. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better here, nicer. I liked her personality in this too, she had more of the backbone, but she was still kind. <br /> <br /> So I give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
