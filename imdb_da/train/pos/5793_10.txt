Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! Before the real story of the movie starts, we get a performance of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and it starts a good movie. After that we get a kind of collage by Michael carrier as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988. After a few music videos too (Speed ​​Demon, Let me alone etc.) Starts the story. <br /> <br /> Basically, Michael and his 3 friends (who are kids) are being chased by the bad guy of the story "Mr. Big" because they discovered his evil plans to have children all over the world to pick up fabrics. During the hunt we see amazing segments, eg. Michael's video for Smooth Criminal, which is amazing with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the kids is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael has to save her before she gets a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the movie we see special effects not only great for the days standards but also impressive today. See e.g. Michael, turning in on a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so cold! <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a performance by Come Together (later published in Michael's double album of HIStory) and you leave the movie with a magical feeling. Fantastic! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to any family who wants to spend a good night with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser!" Yes, he's true, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see..
