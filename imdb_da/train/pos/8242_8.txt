I saw FIDO on some movie channels, and I have to say that I've become an instant fan. The film feels like a cartoon that perfectly captures the look of the surrealistic 1950s, you know the healthy decade when they danced to Elvis while they fell into the atomic bombs in the desert just for the heel. People were so naive back as it is scary and the idea that the clean cut people would find it normal to have zombies as pets that actually work here. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this Canadian production, the colorful sharp filmography and the excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the child. It's a shame that this movie wasn't a big hit. It deserved more recognition. It's much better than things from Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh good. It's an instant classic anyway.
