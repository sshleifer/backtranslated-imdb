Shintarô Katsu, best known for the Zatôichi films, again stars in this third and final movie in Kenji Misumi (mostly known for "Lone Wolf and Cub"), the directed saga of Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami has the great dicked one fighting ninjas, rapsing 'ghosts' and uncovering shady puzzles on the Shogunate Treasury. The Hanzo plot was rather outdated and repetitive. It was once a novel in the first film, no longer. Fortunately, this was better than the other thanks to more humor. I'm just glad they choose to stop at one trilogy (I'm looking at you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My character: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Only Trailers for all 3 Hanzo The Razor films <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima releases both breasts, Mako Midori just her left one
