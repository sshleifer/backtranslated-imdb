... On stage, television or in a book, 'The Woman in Black' is an excellent ghost story. Other reviewers have already said almost everything that needs to be said about this movie, but I thought I would also add my delayed little review. The made-for-TV movie has a deliberately slow first act that chronicles the protagonist Arthur as he goes about his business as a lawyer in the 1920s London. I can understand why this could not appeal to everyone. Nevertheless, I love this British style of storytelling that resembles any of the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" adaptations of the great M.R. James' work. In the second act, the ghost story kicks in as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to clean up a deceased client's affairs. The third act relentlessly builds on a spinal conclusion. As a Londoner, I've seen the game. I own the book, DVD-R and also have the unbroken audiobook on my iPod. What is safe for me, 'The Women in Black' on any medium is a ghost story with few equal. It's time we had a legitimate region 2 DVD release.
