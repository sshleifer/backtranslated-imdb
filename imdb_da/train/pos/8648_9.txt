California is a film about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road without return. The reason is about a couple who are trying to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in America, and his girl - who is a photographer - has to take the pictures. Then they set out on a trail of famous murders without knowing what was waiting for them on the road. Sharing travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and they place an ad. But the couple who answer it is not just a couple. It is one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive, fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel ruthless killer. We learn it early in the movie and we follow him along the journey to California (not with C as usual, but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his fraud and fraud. All the leaders, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes are doing really well, and you should take into account that when this movie was filmed, not even one of them was a star. The photography is amazing, with darkness covering the major parts of the movie, and the music fits the darkness of the film. On the whole, it's a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before taking a stranger in the car to share the gas!
