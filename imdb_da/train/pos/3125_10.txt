Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two we get the final installment. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on coattails of those who know everything. He's been driving too long. This time it ends. The Bourne Ultimatum has a fantastic plot, great writing, great direction, excitement and some of the best summer action. Matt Damon may deliver his best performance to date. He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of intelligent humor here and a good excitement. The reactions to certain events make you either laugh (in a good way) or cheer on. (or both) I heard very intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of patting. The audience loved it. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a nice gift wrapped package. All goods and then some. This is in my opinion the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. How to do summer movie thrillers. I love the Bourne trilogy.
