This is not a bad movie. It's not crazy fun, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> entertaining. It has some fun moments. Cher gives a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role that is very opposite to her real life. Her <br /> <br /> performance alone is worth seeing. If this movie had come out today, it would not have been nominated, but by the 80's standards it was excellent <br /> <br />.
