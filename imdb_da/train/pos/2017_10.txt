After reading only two of the comments here, as a lifelong Bronte fan, beginning with Oliviers Heathcliff and enduring the many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it is more than eye-opening to see that it is the unsung Bronte sister, who gave lies to the man-chauvinist period the thirty inhabited. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the 19th-century British home is that "the girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brushes with "men" were their priests and their waste? brother. That said, it is finally ANNE Bronte, who in her single analysis has proved the feminist point, far ahead of modern types, and including the "mood franchise" ranks. The story evinces, however, more than a few that preceded, including the Greek heterai and Sappho and the like as an ancient emperor Yang Kuei fei. And what about "Eva" and her apple?
