It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories in it. Although 18 different international directors took the challenge, not all of them are good, some of them even boring. But in his unity, "Paris, you t'aime" is breathtaking, and shows that as "love actually" puts it, "love is around," especially in the city of love. Here is an overview (I will try to make as wasteful as possible) of the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - A kind of boring opening sequence, there is nothing special about it. A man finds a parking lot and sees many odd couples passing by and wondering why he can't find a girl. And even suddenly, a woman next to her car disappears ... QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence, about three teenage boys searching for a piece of donkey when suddenly a Muslim girl travels right in front of them and receives help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart to it. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - It was a huge disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an artistic background might have been interesting by the great Van Sant. Finally, everything that comes after the Ulliel monologue is good, everything is just annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a word - is fascinating and the whole sequence is just fun. This kept me connected until the end, and one gets you really connected to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story, even though the performance is poor, is the heart there. It's the story of a Latin American woman who kills her baby early in the morning to take care of another suburban baby. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment should be the weirdest and strangest of the whole movie. A form of shampoo seller arrives at a Chinatown lookalike site in Paris. If I understood correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence. A man meets with his wife at a restaurant to break up with her so that he can run off with his mistress. But the wife has some devastating news. Really basic but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence too. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother. One night she wakes her dead child. When she gets to the place, a cowboy tells her she can give a last goodbye to her baby. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been good, but even though it has some good movie tricks, the story is not exciting and not fun. PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great order, one of the best of the movie! A young girl and an elderly man are discussing their future and her fear of a certain man ... Cuaron does a real job and the actors are amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with his drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad end PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he begins to talk romantic to her ... because she is the love of her life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins seeking new tensions in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic, Pigalle is an easy-down. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some variety to the movie, QdlM is a relief. A young guy (Wood) finds a vampire who kills a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strangely romantic, Madeleine is amazing. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another light-down segment. Directed by Wes Craven and by stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been good, but Père-Lachaise is just plain, not at all original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) that she breaks with him. He reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment has been led by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also a downturn. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14. ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells in his French class about his trip to Paris. Her Frenchmen are really awful, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is so much more than what meets the eye. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, doesn't let me down at all, though some segments bored hell out of me, the movie of the movie is amazing! A real movie experience for young and old. Paris, you t'aime vraiment!
