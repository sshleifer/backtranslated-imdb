Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alarm! <br /> <br /> This undervalued gem of a movie tells the story of Flavia, a fifteenth-century girl of noble births raised in a monastery after defining her father and the entire medieval Christian community by seeing a fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure. Could not accept the monastery's patriarchal rule (explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks). Flavia begins to explicitly ask the society where she finds herself and by encountering a completely subterranean repression, oppression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but to all around her. <br /> <br /> Image as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth. This is a film depicting the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of the rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and eventually Flavia's triumphs must always be destroyed, compromised and perverted by men. Even the cruel end of Flavia is committed by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks look at without horror.) As for the much-discussed violence: This is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven by a religious surplus having pushed away from the violence would have limited the influence of the film, would have ticketed the ticket and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is subjected to. Moreover, it is a realistic portrait of medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully recorded, brilliant acted (especially by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), featuring a wonderful score of piovani and still challenging after all these years Flavia is a classic of European Cinema.
