"Rich in Love" is a slice-of-life movie that takes the viewer into a somewhat quirky Charleston, SC family. Very romanticized, beautifully shot, well-written and acted, "RIL" washes you like a summer breeze, as its plotless meandering draws life on the characters, so in the end of the movie you will feel like an old family friend. <Br /> <br /> A wonderfully crafted character-driven movie by the director of "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is a somewhat fuzzy little "sleeper" that will appeal most to mature audiences.
