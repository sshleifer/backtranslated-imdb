The Sunshine Boys is a great comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite into a television special, despite despising each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo struggles over the silliest little trivial things! The material is quick and witty, appealing to all ages. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are some mildly sad moments towards the end of the movie, acting indirectly with the influence of aging, giving the film a soft, sincere tenderness that points to this reviewer that what mated really need most for success are each other. <br /> <br /> If anyone loves The Odd Couple, you'll love this movie. An excellent movie!
