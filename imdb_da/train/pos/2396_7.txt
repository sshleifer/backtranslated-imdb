This is a very entertaining movie that follows the rehearsal process for a NY production by Macbeth. Although it has much to say about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's themes) in our modern world, the movie works best when it doesn't take too seriously. Reputable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury are doing great jobs, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where Banquo's "murder" (John Elsen) is repeated. Probably a more entertaining movie for those involved in theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
