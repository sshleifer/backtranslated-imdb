A very good adaptation of the novel of amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai have given their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural flair in the movie and I felt it right through. It looked like Bollywood finally gave it glamor and had some quality artists done on the screen. Content wise, the film portrayed much what just happened during the partition by showing suffering of a particular family and also showing the confidence in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they didn't make it a drama with a lot of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
