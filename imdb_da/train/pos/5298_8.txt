John Waters has given us a really fun movie. This is certainly not without its shocking Waters-esque moments, but it's tamer than his older cool stuff, like "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" harkens back to John's early mainstream stage, because it resembles the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in "Polyester". Overall, a really fun comedy with some great moments!
