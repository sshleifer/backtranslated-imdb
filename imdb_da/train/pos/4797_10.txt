I have always been a fan of David Lynch, and with this movie Lynch showed critics that he has talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surrealistic aura that he has become known for the last decade. As much as the movie is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing and tone. The movie moves at a masterly hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of true feeling and power. <br /> <br /> The camera is great as one would expect from a Lynch movie, and the transition mounting sequences are breathtaking. It is also very refreshing to watch a movie where the characters are all kind, friendly folk and non-motivated characters that are clearly labeled as either "good" or "evil". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance like the rest of the casting, especially Sissy Spacek in a fanciful performance as his gloomy and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely decisive role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch showed critics that he could make a highly-moving film as he did in the 80s with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the last decade after he produced such surrealistic films as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but with this movie he showed that there was method for FWWM and LH and it looks as if critics finally caught up with his latest movie 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it received and Oscar's nomination for Lynch. 'Straight Story' is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. It is a loving story of family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.
