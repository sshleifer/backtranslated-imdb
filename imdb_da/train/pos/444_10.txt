This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that means a compliment. Due to the success of very British comedies located at the end or early twentieth century, especially the adaptations of EM Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory-like production was received in the light that was brought to light. when it was released in 1992. It was an extraordinary year for actress Miranda Richardson, who had acted as wife of Jeremy Irons, discovering that her husband has had an affair in the worst possible way in INJURY, and as the IRA terrorist There is a wig in the end and gets an unpleasant comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, calm woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who begins with a journey of self-discovery with Josie Lawrence, who plays Lottie Wilkins. They are associated with an unlikely pair of ladies: a Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker, which resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair, she wears) and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together to only become deep friends, because the story is so full of spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness that almost preaches it, but that's fine; It's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to the American audience) fill the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all of it makes Mike Newell with his movie a living thing of near-magic elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.
