Yes, it's one of the great musical films I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention Kathryn Grayson's small and glorious voice. The music and the dance are amazing. I understand that Frank took Kelly lessons; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is totally unique at the moment. Betty Garrett plays waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great undervalued stars. I saw it again on the A&E TV and also got it in my old videotape. Never get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood ??
