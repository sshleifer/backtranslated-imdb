I had never seen a quiet movie until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found last of Mohicans and unforgettable (Ray Liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source that you are reading this. I started to see Tess of the Storm Country on TCM to see who this Mary Pickford was, who has been credited by many to launch Hollywood. I had no idea what I was up to. Two hours later I got out of it and realized that I had seen one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen playing a role that fits her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, since you've never seen anyone beautiful and expressive before. You have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who was explicit. She was a poor blacksmith, couldn't speak the king's English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
