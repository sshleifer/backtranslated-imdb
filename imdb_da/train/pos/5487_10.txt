You've never seen anything like it. When the coup begins, it is the most dazzling, thrilling thriller you will ever see - even if you know the result. And that's all right because it's a documentary - great. <br /> <br /> When it was over, it was on my Top 10 list of All Time Great Movies. <br /> <br /> Disregard the rubbing right whistles. Everyone I know who watched this movie gives it the 4-star rating. Even if you don't care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you'll find yourself nervous and - believe it - on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> It's a roller coaster ride.
