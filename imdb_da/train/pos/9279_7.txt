Jafar Panahi's comedy drama "Offside" shows some women trying to enter a Tehran sports arena from which women are banned. The official cause: lots of wrong language and the football players have their legs to show. But of course it really is a case of sexism. So most of the film consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions as to why women are banned from the stadium and a woman herself comes up with her own scheme to trust the men. <br /> As I understand, all Jafar Panahi's films (this included) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Qur'an to establish a chauvinist society, and that George W. Bush's current policy towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to act cowboy and tight censorship. Above all, this is a nice look at people who come up with ways to challenge the system. Not a good movie, but worth seeing. Considering that all Jafar Panahi's films are banned, I wonder how he can make them himself.
