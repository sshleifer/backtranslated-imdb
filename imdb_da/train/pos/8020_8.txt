I found this to be the most enjoyable Muppet movie because I felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. Muppets try to go on Broadway to sell an original musical they've written, but along the way they run into the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. Although there are not so many good cameos here as in the original "Muppets Movie", there are some including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply the timing and delivery of so many lines is great, and the situations that Muppets are in are fun. The original songs are also good here, and the end is satisfactory. There is not much else to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. It's the funniest Muppet movie and will surely be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
