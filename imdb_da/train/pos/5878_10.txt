Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as a womanizer who has affair with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is fun at times, and it is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is great as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered good films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his funniest movie he has made. The three new actresses are average. The supermarket doesn't get much space in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple story of a guy who had an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off on the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with lots of laughs, this is a non stop entertainer.
