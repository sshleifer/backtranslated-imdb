Who doesn't know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (the three countries where French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which itself is an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. After a first and unsuccessful attempt at a TV show, the right thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that's what most fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not to strictly customize the cartoon series. Some essential parts, signs and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a first class fan of the comic, I have to admit that I was nicely surprised. The actors are good, so is the scenario, although it may seem too fast. I therefore recommend this movie to anyone interested in economic / political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series that I could read over the internet.
