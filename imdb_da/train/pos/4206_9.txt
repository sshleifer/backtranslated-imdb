Skip McCoy is a three-hour flashlight that is unable to slow down his instincts on the street, he chooses the Candy bag on a subway. What he does not know is that Candy carries top secret microfilm, microfilm, which is of great interest to many many organizations. Director Samuel Fuller has made an extraordinary drama among the seedy underworlds of New York City. Communist spies and shady government operations all combine to make Pickup On South Street an accurate first-minute display. Based on a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller followed this adaptation with a heavy political agenda, which many at that time felt was over, but focusing only on his anti-communist fates makes it a great disservice. /> <br /> Dig a little deeper and you find characters as exciting as anyone who has addressed Fuller, the protagonist of one is the hero of the piece, a villain and a low man, his hero's not born out of love for his country , they are born out of his pure stubborn streak. It is quite a feat that Fuller has made one of the best anti-hero in the fifties and I'm sure he was most grateful for Richard Widmark's appearance as McCoy, all the laughing and ice-cold cold heart, his interplay with The wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent and is the heart of the movie. But it is the Oscar-nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the play, her moe is strong and as sneaky as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired heat for her that Ritter mediates meditatively. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie in texture but an A movie in completion, Pickup On South Street is a great and entertaining movie that is the best of its most exciting instructor. 9.10
