I'm afraid it was a movie you really need to get it out of. I'm not a thoughtless movie like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" do you know the one where Riggs is really crazy? It's not a movie that's pretty much the same at the end, as it's a beginning. You can run anywhere, talk on the phone do anything and enjoy it in any way. I have previously noticed that most people who do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because ..... duh, they don't understand it or understands it or what happened. <br /> <br /> Don't let your dog take a shower !!!
