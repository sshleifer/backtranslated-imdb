Saturday June 3rd at. 18.30 Neptune June 5 at. 16.30 Neptune </strong> Get celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity so powerful as Carlos Saura's brilliant interpretation of Isaac Albeniz's masterpiece Iberia Suite. At the turn of his century, Saura collaborated on an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song for their homeland. The twelve "impressions" in the package are presented without any narrative in sharp surroundings, allowing each performance to explode before Saura's camera. Creative use of large apartments and mirrors moving throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projections, adds brilliant dramatic effects to the varied choices of song, dance and instrumental performance. Albeniz's images re-emerge throughout the program, linking the passion of music with his great creator. Saura includes all the Spaniards on his scene from the beautiful elegance of older flamenco dancers in traditional costume for children who are delighted with their instructors.
