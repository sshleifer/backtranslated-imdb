A young woman who is a successful model, who is also committed to getting married, and who has twice tried suicide in the past, has been chosen by a secret and distant affiliation of Catholic priests to be the next "sentinel" to the gate to hell, which apparently goes through a creepy old but well-maintained Brooklyn apartment complex. Its tenants take up the stairs and can reincarnate themselves, but apparently it can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the road. The former (John Carradine) is about death, then she becomes of destiny or anything the next, and the convicts have to kill her for being free. Lots of interesting details lie beneath the surface, her relationship with her father, the judges' stories, her fianc√© so that you can pass this out as cheap exploitation fear, but considering the sets, the big throw and the total level of bizarreness, this is absolutely worth seeing.
