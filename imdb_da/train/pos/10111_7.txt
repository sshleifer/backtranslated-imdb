The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a very good documentary. The aesthetic is the lack and cheap appearance, the people in it go on keyboard, which makes it very unfocused and coherent, but it adds to the charm. I say this because it is a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded itself with other oddballs and as such there is really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits. There are some glimpses of insight into both genius and fatigue, and the portrayal of both qualities is a recognition of the documentary's authenticity. All in all, it is worth looking at the Wood tab and the film's films in general, but don't expect shine here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.
