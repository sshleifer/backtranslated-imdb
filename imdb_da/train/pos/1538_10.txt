This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live just a few miles from the village where history takes place, and I know how things work out in this area in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! It both criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and the manufacturer wants people who watch the movie to be more open and more interested in your closest friends and family. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also recognize much of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
