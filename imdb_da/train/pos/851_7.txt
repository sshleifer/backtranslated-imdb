Pierce Brosnan has sipped his last Martini and returns in a monstrous self-parody as the aging foul-mouthed boozzy assassin Julian Noble, who has a special love for teenage girls, bullfighting and sticky clothes. During a job in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a businessman in Denver who is at the forefront and who is in town to make his living in a hotel bar. Despite their very different personalities and Julian's raw and insensitive remarks, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Strongly worn by Pierce Brosans and Greg Kinnear's performances, director Richard Shepard revealed that he did not write the movie with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can hardly imagine it without him. He turns out to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold war pioneer. The scene where the two meetings at a shiny hotel bar (amazing set and beautifully photographed) is really a brave piece of play. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably the scrupulously scripted, the two actors are largely improvising, but they do marvelously! It almost feels like a new standard on the screen. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS, who improvises and adds one of the most subtle support of many genre clich√©s and actors' own typecasting (Brosnans James Bond in particular), and you have one of the nicest mating in the latest Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is thin after a while. After one hour the film just runs out of steam. Nevertheless, and I can't put my finger on it exactly, I enjoyed it very much. It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some tips for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters do not offer much to do, but this film offers something new, in that respect, almost without blending all traditional genres into a quite entertaining spoof. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
