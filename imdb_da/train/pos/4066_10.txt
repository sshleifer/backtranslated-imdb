Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel like a child again; It's just magical. It's a crime it took so long after it was released in the states, but now it's here, check it out! And stick to the original language dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> I give it a ten / ten.
