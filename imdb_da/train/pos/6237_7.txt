Oh my, from the box description I thought it would be LA crazy like 2 days in the valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most, after correcting this, would have driven a rock or at least committed a mass murder. I confess only to see the first half hour (for now). Read all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Sange fra Seconden as a parallel, but it is fun with humor and imagination, and it is unsustainable in its dour realism. What has the Marshall Plan and the EU done? Seeing this in a theater with someone I know would only have resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I came across on DVD. There is a more annoying being in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - Hitchhiker from Hell. Whatever happens to her, it's not enough! Souless suburbia, which I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida, thrives in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban shopping centers? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who, when asked about Western civilization, why could that be a good idea? If the world really was like this movie, bring it down, we're ready.
