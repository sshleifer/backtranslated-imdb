For a "no budget" movie, this thing stinks. I don't know if America will like it, but we laugh all the way through. Some really funny fun stuff. Really non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The actors and music rocked. The cars and gags and even less in your face blew us up. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've seen in advertising or in something somewhere. Basically it's Rocked! Luckily I got a copy from one of a friend's friend.
