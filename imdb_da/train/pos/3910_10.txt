So I'm at home, flipping channels one night, and I come across this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Of course I did a double-take and decided I would look a little bit. I didn't change the channel until he was done, it was so much fun. The next time it was on, I made sure to lose it so I could see it again and again, and it has remained one of my favorite things to look at. In the first few minutes you can tell that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them with his incredible humor and humor. While many stand-up comedians mesh together in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians hold onto current events. His show stayed with me afterwards. I went to Italy during the summer and all I could think of while I was there was how "Italians are always on scooters going" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See it. You will not regret it.
