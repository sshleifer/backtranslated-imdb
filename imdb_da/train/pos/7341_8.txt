I enjoy Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and am a Frank Frazetta collector and fan. I am also a sword and wizard fan who loves Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard's worlds. I missed "Fire and Ice's" theatrical release back in 1983 and have been looking forward to watching it on video or on any revival ever since. Therefore, the 2005 release became a dream come true for me. But I bought it with a bit of trepidation because I hoped it was not only worth looking at once and then putting on the shelves as a "collector's item" collecting dust until the day I died. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie. As with Frazetta art, this is a gritty movie that has a physical and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / swords and Turkish movies without being cheesy or dirty. The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta as its best. Even my young boys loved to see it with me and ask to see it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because of the lightly dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not mind, because it is credible, and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Roto-scoping is used, but I personally enjoy roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that are difficult to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity issues, I recommend this movie to everyone Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and swords and wizard fans. Enjoy!
