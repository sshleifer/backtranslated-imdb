I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. It's one of only a handful of movies ever made that I would consider romantic. trying to talk plot or performance or technical details about this movie would be in the words of frank zappa "as dancing about architecture". It definitely beats the nail right up the way it captures the fleeting moments of life that move us and then run away from us, never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the end is open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no deep life education, just a few creepy and intelligent children, exploring the ability to feel most irrational and unrealistic of emotions ...... romantic love. 10 out of 10 see it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
