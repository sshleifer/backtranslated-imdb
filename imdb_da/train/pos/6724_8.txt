As a popular sport, surfing was desired by many people. Right after seeing the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact, the surfers are also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by it. But they continued to surf and enjoy themselves. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave came upon them. You have to adapt best and avoid direct strike from the big wave. When you win, it will of course give you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The amazing movie cannot be overlooked. It is absolutely visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8.10
