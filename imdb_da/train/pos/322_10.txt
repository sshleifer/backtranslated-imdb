this movie is not porn, it was not supposed to be porn, and unless my uncle runs to world president, it should never be considered porn. Now that this issue was sorted out, I can say I thoroughly recommend this movie as it is still problematic. It's fun, the play is great and it raises serious (curious) questions. I can't fully understand why this movie was so mistreated, probably that's why I'm planning to never visit us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrl movement, confusion, curiosity and humor are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
