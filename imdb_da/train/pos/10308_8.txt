Well, was Morgan Freeman something more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie was probably better than what bore "Oh God". I was completely engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the kind of anchorman wannabe, and Aniston performed his part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual successful performance. I do not consider her to be either ugly or outrageous. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the filing cabinet and thought it could never keep his life story. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that keeps the events in his bathroom humor: I rolled over this one. Well written and even better played, this comedy will go down as one of the best of this fun.
