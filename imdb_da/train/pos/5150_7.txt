Although Ian Kershaw removed from this project because of inaccuracies in relation to Hitler's life and yes, this is dramatized, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler in his later years during this documentary, which deals only with Hitler from boyhood, until he became German Chancellor, including The Long of the Knives. This TV movie (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, for example. the financial disaster from 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and a little bit different, except for Fritz Gerlich's and Ernst Hanfstaengl's life. All in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, but I think it should have been more closely focused on stronger filmography; most actors are portrayed in half body images, which (for me) make for a theater performance, not cinematic. The pace is sometimes drowsy and the film suffers from what is about 2.5 hours long.
