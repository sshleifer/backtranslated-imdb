Road to Perdition, a film undeservedly overlooked in that year Oscars is Sam Mendes' second work (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years earlier won the Academy Award for his widely recognized but controversial American beauty. It's a great movie, and at the same time ultimately angry and sad. It is a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from the outside during difficult times of depression, when Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but should say so) is a hitman for the local mafia manager played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen year old boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, finds after many years of happy ignorance what his father is working on and what money their family lives. Followed by his curiosity and his desire to know the truth, he accidentally witnesses a murder committed by John Rooney, son of his father's chief. Such a discovery strikes an innocent soul, and it caused many events that changed its life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and filmography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the film's main line, the most important moments and points in the film and the key factor for the movie success are difficult relationships between father and son in bad times. They are so deep, strong and trustworthy. Tom Hanks does great and has one of the best performances in his career in a rather unusual role for him, and all the action across the board is fantastic. Finally worth mentioning a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an excellent work by all people involved in making this beautiful (but once again sad) masterpiece. I think Road to Perdition is one of the greatest achievements of film production in this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. My grade 10 out of 10
