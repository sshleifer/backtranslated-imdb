Forget Neo and Bourne, and all the half-baked made modern heroes. They only look 12-year-olds to delight the wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can't be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that don't have beards and yet meet teenagers, want to see something that looks like an action flick. <br /> <br /> But their "action set-pieces" are just painful to watch and any girl can challenge their masculinity without question. This explains the recruitment of oldies on our silver screens over the last few years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, brace himself .... didn't have a beard !!) I say it is a celebration a new hero went up and put their government to an end. This "Largo Winch" movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley gave a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he was weakened is when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved her beard! I rest on my case. <br /> <br /> I didn't know when I got into the theater, but maybe it's the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a movie can be both well-made and anchored in B-genre without blushing its performance. Meanwhile, all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of fertilizer or something too limited to reach a wider audience. In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, remember you) ... I think "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be both popular and quality movie. <br /> <br /> I left the theater very happy and hungry for more.
