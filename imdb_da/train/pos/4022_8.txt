Another detailed work on the subject of dr. Dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned Panjab. Dr Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his film debut. He has worked on all the careful details to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Although we haven't been in the region during that time, the sets and costumes look right. Unlike most films made on the partition, it does not focus on the violent details of violence to attract the audience, but on its aftermath. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee has given an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai has acted his heart to show the situation to a guilty man. The rest of the throw has also done a good job.
