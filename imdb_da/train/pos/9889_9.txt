Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my own feelings for this movie so more eloquent than I could ever have. I am only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on television, the IFC, I think. It's such a unique movie, I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Sedona-like Durango, Mexico (by the John Wayne movies), but a really strong and wild place. I have to find the novel now to look at the original location of history. Like the location, this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and certainly not for everyone. It's the kind of production that almost motivates me to study movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't actually forget this movie, it's indelible. But over the years I had forgotten its existence. I know no one has seen it, had never read it or seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I had even forgotten the title. Now I want to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since the above posting I have become a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not reading him before. <br /> <br /> Compared to MsMyth's comment below, the film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and did not comment on Mexico or Mexico's history in any way, even though Marquez now resides in Mexico for political reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying desperately to find a copy of this movie for my library. Wanted the movie? You have to read the story, and then everything else wrote Garcia Marquz. And by the way, the original location in history was Colombia.
