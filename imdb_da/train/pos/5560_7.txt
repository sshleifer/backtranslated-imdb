SPOILERS <br /> A friend of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong flip and went out of his way to make me borrow it and BLUE BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, really has nothing of what defines a movie ... but it's fun. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little piece I put in the plot, but being that four fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would normally start a story. I just want to say that Cheech's cousin turns out. <br /> <br /> Wasn't there any other fun moment when Chong got Cheech to drink pee twice? What about the rooster? Was it Pee-Wee Herman's first film appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it great, but the movie has heart and hey, my buddy lets me borrow it so it gets a 7.
