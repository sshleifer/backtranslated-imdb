With all the newer films dealing with the British monarchy, is it really time for someone else? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of UK cinema dealing with the royal family. In this case, it's about Princess Victoria's early life and events leading up to the coronation of her as Queen of the whole of England, as well as her romance and eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy lives and careers of both England's Queen and Prince, as well as several other events that show (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a brilliant Victoria in her youth while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the casting is rounded off with the likes of Miranda Richardson, the Dutchman of Kent, and always welcome on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others shining on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), comes from a winning manuscript by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I went all the way out of my head over the film's visual appearance (by the film photographer Hagen Bogdansker), which gave each movie frame a picturesque look (with the help of the production designer Patrice Vermette) as well as a little tight editing (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes' script is the use of a game of Chess, as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the movie are moving like the pieces on a chessboard). This is smart, well-written, directed, filmed, edited and acted entertainment (and enlightenment) that allows for a well-spent evening at the cinema. Rated PG by MPAA for a couple of scenes of sensuality, a little short of violence (a little bloody, though nothing for gory), a rude outbreak of language and some on-screen smoking
