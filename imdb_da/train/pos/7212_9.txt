I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of Death Trap in a top 5 list of the best scene for movie adaptations ever. Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and "Superman") play each other very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - which I don't normally care about - is completely thrown into a role that exploits its annoyance as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that "Deathtrap" comparisons with "Sleuth" - another brilliant scene-to-screen match with Michael Caine - are valid or even fair. Yes, the two stories have much in common. But "Sleuth" is just as much about class war crimes as the battle of battle, and the house in "Sleuth" is set, is at least as much a sign in the movie as the two actors - the house does not really match in Deathtrap. And "Deathtrap" "is not so much a struggle of wits as it is a pointed vignette on how people are not damned good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. Just say that both movies are great examples of the genre and worth you have the time and the money, after all, the United States. You don't have to choose! <br /> <br /> I won't give away the turns of the plot, but I don't think that means anyway. I've seen the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still have enjoyed chemistry and timing and the average scary moments when things go "all pear-shaped." Everything is done as well, The trip becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes black-haired comedy and excitement in the Hitchcock movie-making style is likely to enjoy Deathtrap tremendously.
