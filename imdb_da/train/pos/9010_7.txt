A little quirky and bordering on bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy to see. A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is with a restrained carer, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist as a daydream of human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to revive his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying Jane who suffers from a neurological disease, all of whom have left their speechless and very little motor skills. The wheelchair bound and full of spirit, her last dying desire is to lose her virginity. She goes to Richard, who will not help her directly; But is willing to steal a bank to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has some charisma and equality.
