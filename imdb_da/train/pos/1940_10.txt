I was really impressed with this movie. The script was amazing and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real characters and making the viewer sucked straight into their world. Furthermore, the music is fantastic. They worked some independent to make the score, and some of the soundtracks, and they do a great job with the movie. If you have a chance to capture this movie in a small theater or movie festival (as I did), I highly recommend you see it. Also on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's reason enough to go check it out.
