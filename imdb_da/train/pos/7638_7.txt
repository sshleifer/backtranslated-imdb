Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling that he is missing something. Ever since he missed a decisive baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he has been convinced that his life would have proven better if he had made that shot. So one night breaks his car again. Enter the nearest bar to wait for the truck, Larry is on the barman Mike, who is not familiar with Larry, is changing his life forever ....... The alternative life perspective in cinema is hardly a new thing that stretches back to the minds of It's a wonderful life and shows no sign of diminishing with the very recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It is a genre that has produced very mixed results. Back in 1990, this James Belushi led production, rarely mentioned when the said issue arises, it seems that it has largely been forgotten. It is a shame as it oozes charm and is not short in the humor department. We know that we are being led to the end of its ultimate message, but it is a fun and fun way to be shut down. The film also draws attention to what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was. Do I mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation is not your thing? So are the chances that you would avoid this movie anyway. But for those involved with like Red Heat, K-9 and Care of Business, Mr. Destiny right up your way. Together with the trip are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fate, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message in his heart. 10.7
