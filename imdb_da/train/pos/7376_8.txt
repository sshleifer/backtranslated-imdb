I really enjoyed this debut of vice president Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Call in advance, you will be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this flick. It has a subtle spookiness about what works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that attack most common movies of this genre. If you like movies that give you chills, then you probably like this. A good, eerie debut by Hideo Nakata. 8.10
