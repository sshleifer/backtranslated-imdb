It was accidentally that I scanned the TV channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful people who are attracted to each other in a very innocent and maiden-like approach to each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This gal and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really want you to have followed your heart strings with a guy or gal, you deeply loved and lost over the years race. Jesse and Celine have a good conversation and deep eye contact with a large magnetic explosion between the two. I'm looking forward to SEQUEL for this movie in 2004 and if you've seen this movie, you'll feel the same.
