A very unique Sci-Fi animated movie, and I honestly love unique, no matter what way it tends to be, better or worse. This French film is very interesting to see, the technique is innovative, like "Waking Life", I recently saw. It took me a long time to get used to the black and white style, but eventually I love it, the sketchlike pictures are really fancy! The contracted future world is a symbol of the ultimate destination of humanity, which I love it a lot. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is fine for a Sci-Fi, not so exciting, but it's okay, like some Hollywood products, a huge conspiracy about man's eternity, a little bit of clich√©, and the twisted end is not so convincingly, some development is just too common and imperfect, and the whole movie is too long. So I think I 'm just in love with the style this movie shows, others are not that good. On the eternity of life, I think most people have come to unanimity that we do not want eternity because it breaks down the importance of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever, and the world of the world becomes so disaster and chaos. Leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but it is also a way of showing that our lives are genuine, and every emotion fulfills one's life and makes the world colorful and lively.
