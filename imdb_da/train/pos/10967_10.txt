I first saw this movie in my drama and playwrights course at Tulane. I was appalled at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look at the unformed reality of a loneliness life. The family is fascinating, and I thought it really showed Little Edie on her core. ** As a side picture, my professor told myself that throughout the movie, Little Edie fell in love with one of the camera men. ** The beauty I find stems from nature in family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter who could not function in society alone, and you begin to desire Little Edie's rehabilitation for the community. All in all, the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality, and it is the portrayal of surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
