Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult follower, especially in Europe. Nevertheless, the majority of his films are more than forgettable. However, he directed a really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". Earlier in his career, the films that followed were subordinate. From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works at all levels. It is filmed with flawless fluidity and boasts fine performances throughout. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances are at their highest. Widmark, who was no stranger to playing villains but really means the core, still manages to reveal the smallest humanity that makes his character fascinating and makes Jean Peter's character fall to him, the more credible. <br /> Fuller holds no beats in this really tough movie. There is a scene where Jean Peters is shaken up by Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not the case with carefully choreographed photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many film noir's of the period, this is a good example of the genre.
