This is not the Masterpiece Theater. You should not go into that expect it. This is pure girl FUN with the most amazing cast of female driver. As someone else said, the movie Baby Mama was supposed to be. And the only drawback I see in this movie is that Tina Fey wasn't in it - besides that, the stars are the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really see, you will know that it has many messages and deep meaning to any of us who want them to go back and do it all again in life, knowing what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
