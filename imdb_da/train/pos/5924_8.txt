Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who love cats so it would have been a big downside to the movie, but I loved how cats from all were getting their revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady very irresistibly, I think the desire became better for me while I saw this movie. There was one thing I was disappointed with. I've seen Charmed before, and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad comparing to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more a little more, that was the only disappointment in the movie, but I guess it was made along with Brian Krause in the tight jeans he had been wearing. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Comb's heavenly husband and father of her son in for a great surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angelfish. Even though I think about it, it would be great to see Krausu's character on Charmed taken over by evil, which made him something like his in Sleepwalkers. I must also say that the music was amazing in this movie too!
