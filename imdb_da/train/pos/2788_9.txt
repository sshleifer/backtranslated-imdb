This is a so-called 'feel-good' movie, but it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy and the fact that at age 12 I decided to quit football. <br /> <br /> Football is the red line in this movie. Along with the fight, young people have the expectations the parents have. An English-Indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dress like a boy and play football ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also releases ordinary people's lives as well as Indian society in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your one life (where have we heard before). Parameters Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17-year-old girl stuff. Unlike her sister Pinky, you must do the opposite of Yasminda. A real must is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with her parents' traditions and finally finds her luck. With good music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C and Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Pleasant to see, but if you've ever played football and never made it to the top, this movie will make you melachonic.
