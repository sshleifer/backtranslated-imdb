An excellent and precise movie ... McGovern has great pain in examining and documenting his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, though it may draw unfavorable reviews and comments from some who like stories that are clean and sweet and glossy. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston, but not as high a role he played in Hillsborough. I found this movie so accurate, well-acted and well presented as Hillsborough, and I welcome McGovern for his exciting unapologetic writing. Well done and my hat is off for the author, the actors, the production staff. A good movie!
