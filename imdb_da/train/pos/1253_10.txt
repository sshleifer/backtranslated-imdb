This well-founded and carefully examined documentary outlines the appalling case of Chagos Island, which between 1969 and 1971 shows that they were massively deported from their homeland through the talks of British and American governments. Anglo-American political decision-makers chose to act because of their view that the islands would be strategically crucial bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through air and naval force projection. At some point during the Cold War, when most newly-settled post-colonial states moved away from the western course, British and American officials seem to feel that the island's decision to determine the fate of the islands was not a viable option. Instead, they chose to carry out the wholesale trade that was forced to remove the indigenous population. The film shows that nothing was done for the islanders at the time of their exhaust, and that from the Mauritius waterfront where they were left, the displaced Chagossian community fell for three decades of privatization and, in these new circumstances, possessed homelessness, They experienced significantly faster deaths. However, after over three decades, in recent months (and years), after the release of many utterly cursed papers from the UK's public post office (one suspects that there was a mistake and these papers were not published). The resulting legal appeal from the ex-chagossic community has seen British courts consistently benefit the islanders and the British state. As such, the amazing and worrying conclusions of the film can only be reasonably seen as proven. Nevertheless, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have so far not committed themselves to returning to the islands that the courts have finally entered into are the legitimate inhabitants. This is a very valuable movie for everyone to see, but it is important for the British and Americans to see. Being silent in the light of these facts is to be complicated in a thorough nasty crime.
