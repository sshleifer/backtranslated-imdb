I want to know why John Amos left the show and how did he die again from the show? I couldn't relate to anything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they faced. By the way, they never made it out of the ghetto? I think the episode of the black Jesus was my favorite. We got to see them experiencing a few good times. something they didn't have very often. I wish they would bring the show back. During the day, people can actually stop seeing. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
