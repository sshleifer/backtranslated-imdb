I don't want to spend too long here the frames about the plot - you've seen the trailer and if you don't have it online. I do not recommend seeing it myself - it was poorly crafted and did not pack any of the laughs or the magic of the movie. So those who avoid this movie because of their miserable trailer should give this a chance. It is great fun. I was blown away by wisdom and originality in this movie. The first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysteria - my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad Austin Powers movie at the end of 20. However, this is one of the few films where the campy ending did not make me the rest of the movie (as is usually the case). Everyone gives a good performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really good moments all the way through. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - only to capture all the details that I laughed at the first show!
