Here is the kind of love story I enjoy watching. And for the most part it is for two reasons. It concentrates on young, very young people. People who are still in their teens and experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and "The Man in the Moon" is a magnificent reflection on our memories, perhaps adding a few details and improving it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I think that as teenagers it is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you think the characters could really be in love or just so recent they love that they just believe they are and after a tragedy or so, will believe in the rest of the Their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man in the Moon" is full of great names. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, capable of playing hard district lawyers as well as rigorous but caring and wise fathers as in this movie. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress as she is aged fourteen, and you think about ten years down the road, she will win the Academy Award. All members of the player pull out of amazing performances and with the dialogue of the compelling manuscript they are enhanced to look like real people in real-life situations. As if it all really happened. This kind of movie I want to see comes out more often. Love story or not. I would love to watch movies that make everything look right and are not fake or unimaginable in any way.
