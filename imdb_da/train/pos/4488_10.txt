Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween. I know it doesn't have much creepiness, but has the "trick" as in "Trick or Treat" as Jerry made Tom with a window blind and the vacuum cleaner with a collared shirt hanging on it to make it a ghost; But still like to put it on my list of Halloween comics. In this short, Tom listened to the "Witching Hour", a ghost story program on the radio and feared the horror story was being told. Halfway into the story, the drama (hair standing to the end, heart jumping into the throat, ice cold chills on the spine) begins to get started with Tom. . . literally. And Jerry has observed it all and laughs at himself, thinking he raised Tom's fear by scaring him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a little fun. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons where Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others are the lonely mouse, a mouse in the house and the nit-witty kitty. And also this short is the first of 25 cartoons where Tom speaks. The others are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, Million Dollar Cat, Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Comes To Dinner, Quietly Please!, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Over and Mouse Under directed by Chuck Jones.
