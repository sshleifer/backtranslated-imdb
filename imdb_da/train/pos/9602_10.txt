Darius Goes West is a film that shows American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking movie shows a young man who never expected, but longed to see what was beyond the confines of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the sea. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius' desire a reality. They started small - Ben & Logan's mother started an email campaign to draw attention to Darius's condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellows to take Darius not only to see the sea but to see these great USA. To say the young fellows managed to bring hope and awareness of this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives to a halt as they show love, care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can show the same traits to others suffering from DMD. Darius continued to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his friends) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of colleague friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it anymore. Martha Sweeney.
