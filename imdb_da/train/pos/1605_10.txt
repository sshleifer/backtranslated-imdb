"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own that movie on DVD! The film deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with his boyfriend (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also good. The direction from Norman Jewison (who instructed "Fiddler On The Roof") is amazing. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
