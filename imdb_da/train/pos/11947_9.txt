Simply well-written, instructed and acted ... Woody's best of 2000 isn't his best since the 80's !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's scared with Woody evidence how well-rounded an actress she's become. <br /> <br /> Not being a romance on the screen with the leading lady is refreshing. He plays the perfect bumbling magician. <br /> <br /> There have been a few reviews that malign this movie. Don't let them stop you from watching the wonderfully made movie. People in the crowd, I saw this with, laughed so loudly on some lines, I missed the next line. If you like Woody Allen movies from the 70's, you'll regret missing this one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go see this movie with an open mind, if you do, you can smile.
