Vivah is by no means a classic. But in the days of hardcore action, groundbreaking special effects & complex plots (no one has Bollywood mastered yet), it's quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story we all know is a journey from a few first meeting to their eventual wedding after some enjoyable moments and test times. Nothing more, nothing less. The music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but also not your senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan Abhi Aadha & Hamaari Shaadi were hummable. Shahid sincerely performs and shows great potential. It's good to see him playing something other than the "cool guy" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a rich little town girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are great support and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. Surah's direction is simple but effective. The film's primary fault is the slow pace that can test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all, a good, clean, decent family movie.
