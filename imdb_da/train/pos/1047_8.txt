It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who knocked out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10 / 10 Role for Best Actor Oscar. (I would still have given Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a good job and deserved the nomination.) I'm glad I controlled this movie because I enjoyed it immensely. The movie preaches a little, but I don't just mind, I enjoyed the speakers and never got bored. <br /> <br /> The action was excellent in this movie, I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightly Designated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (not mistakenly nominated), George Coulouris, and odd Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child, I really enjoyed his character: an odd-looking boy who speaks like some sort of philosopher, he jumps me straight up. Even the character's name (Bodo) is fun But when Luke's character was forced to do something he considered wrong, even though he did so for all the right reasons, he also worked for me. I agreed why he felt he had what he did and I understood why he couldn't explain it. The message that this movie does is a good and noble, the scene (meaning the house) is beautiful, and the play is excellent. Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
