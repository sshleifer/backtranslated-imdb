Finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! I see most horror movies coming out ... Theatrical, Straight-to-DVD, cable, etc ... and most of them suck ... a few can be seen ... even fewer are actually good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I got a screening of this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! With no names of actors, I suppose the budget on this movie was pretty low, but you wouldn't know ... the movie looks great ... the actor works completely for the movie ... the story is good ... and the scares are good ! While most filmmakers focus exclusively on the scares, they often forget history and character development, two things that help deliver the scares more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley should know that character and history are important. He develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more afraid when they are in danger. Watch horror movies that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5000 to make, I find "Dark Remains" to be one of those gems out there. Check out this movie!
