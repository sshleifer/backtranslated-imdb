With the badly injured Tony in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines that he is leading a seller's life participating in a business convention while his family and friends are going through hell and trying to cope with the possible loss of the great man. The dream sequences are right out of an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, which Tony finds himself transformed into an average Joe, trying to handle a missing wallet and mixed identities while on a business trip across the country. His intonation as a blazer and khaki wear knuckle is more mid-American and less than an Italian bitch from Noo Joisey. A nice touch. The shocking long-haired, hippy-dippy AJ (which Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at some point) has a nice scene with his outdated old man. The best moment, the big boys have tried to talk about life without Tony, who immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute. Vito goes out of a line about the newly born gene, possibly having been a closet, which is interesting in light of what we must learn about Vito.
