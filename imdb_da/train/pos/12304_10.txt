This is a great movie. I like it where he climbs down to get the ink, and the skeletons chase him, but fortunately he dumbled them, opened the window and then didn't even notice them. xiao qian is also very beautiful. & when he stuck the needle up Wu's ass, it was hysterical. And when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords, it is also great. So also the part where he eats his bowls while he looks at that guy kills many people. Then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. Add the comic timing, the giant tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. Not to mention amazing special effects for the 90s.
