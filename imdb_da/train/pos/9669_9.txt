After reading the original game, I thought it would have been much harder to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann puts in a once-in-a-lifetime performance like Public Gar, the suppressed antagonist, manifested openly on the screen of his outgoing (but unseen to others) alto-private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "scrub" whose inability to communicate his emotions is only matched by Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth renting out if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside of Ireland and the UK)
