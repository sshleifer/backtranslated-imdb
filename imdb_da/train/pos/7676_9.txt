Brilliant! My wife and I joined the scattered line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story of an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is a worn westerner. The film grabbed every bone in our body. There are no graphical scenes or anything that is hard to see - it is the normality's surrealism that really kicks you in the intestines. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thyy Ngoys rawness (can't believe this is her first play) and Ron Livingston's performance was with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
