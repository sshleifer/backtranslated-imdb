No, not really, but it's a really good movie, and unfortunately it's a forgotten gem. Black and white fits the movie. <br /> <br /> Just ahead formula, a guy had the plague, and the authorities have to track everyone he came in contact with before they die. <br /> <br /> Very well directed and the play is amazing. Richard Widmark as the male management is good but is completely overshadowed by the actors of Paul Douglas as chief of police and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the evil ones. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in some really other gangster gangsters or war movies.
