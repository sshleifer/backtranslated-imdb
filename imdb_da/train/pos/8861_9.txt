Says Andy: "No one gets hurt, everyone wins." Before he says it, we know the opposite is true: Everyone gets hurt, no one wins. This is a new string in American movies, or perhaps an old beach brought back to the end. Think "Eastern promises", "there will be blood", "no land for old men". These films are dark, serious, extremely well crafted and do not care about happy ending. I love them. "Before the devil knows you are dead" fits the general description but creates an atmosphere entirely. Kelly Masterson's debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie ever comes to a Greek tragedy. Celebrating Scientific Director Stanley Donen, expert and sober Sidney Lumet turns the gloomy story into an outstanding old-fashioned drama. The opening shots, although an overweight accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting. In return, drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of Mondrian's. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finney's character Charles feels a little over-acted, eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time. But then he is in trouble deeply, deeper than any of the problems most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you don't have to tell me. Why her character Gina would be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's okay. Action is after all character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this fine film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
