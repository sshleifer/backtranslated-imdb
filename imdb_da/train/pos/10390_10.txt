Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", this is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a real shame, it's not as well known as the previous movies (perhaps because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than modern or sci-fi settings, and it's British, which means a smaller market for movies) but it is nice that it deserves the reputation. Like all the big family movies, one can be a child, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I am currently 18), but you must appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic movie score) competing with the John Williams "Star Wars" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful set, dialogue and color usage (both set and filmography won Oscars and state-of-the-art Oscar-winning special effects (currently, and some are still amazing). And of course, June Duprez looks like the Princess is competing with Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!). In conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite films (next to "The Robin Hood's Adventure"), and it really deserves more attention. It's a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and along with "Robin Hood" it's my desert movie that I could see again and again without being annoyed. Stars: **** (excellent)
