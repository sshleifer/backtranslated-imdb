The fantastic star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this witty, fun, smart, frothy comedy with lots of sword fighting and knockabout antics. Charming loopy in her storytelling, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the interest of love. A movie you will remember with great love.
