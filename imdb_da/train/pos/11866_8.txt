Most people who have seen this movie believe it is the best movie ever made. I disagree, but this film is very good. Tony is a bad ass guy and knows he is scary and uses it to move on. It's about him and how he goes from washing up to having a big house and an office with cocaine over the desk. If you want a family movie, then it is not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and revenge and then you will like it.
