Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's hit Broadway thriller could not wait for it to be the skin's incarnation for the shutter before setting it up on the silver screen, so the producers wisely decided to get the best out of the long White Way run! The film's opening and closing scenes have been shot at New York's intimate Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even the film's last fadeout on the theater market is a version of the stage play's famous logo. (Although marketers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's Cube movie icon.) <br /> <br /> Now on a cheap DVD edition, DEATHTRAP seems as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is just right (better than their stage models) and the place scouts should be applauded to find a suitable spooky house for our "one room, two act thriller" to take place in. Opened in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet sets wise on something new "material" at the beginning and end of the film, leaving Levin's vicious center alone. <br /> <br /> The film's last scene is a great Hollywood departure from the boards and undermines one of Levin's plot points from earlier in the movie [Helga (about a dagger): "Will be used by another woman for play. "]. Like Robert Altman's PLAYER, our new final movie helps with each other and blur the lines between the stage, the screen and (could it be?) Real life!
