Ghosts that still go are one of the movies that tackles you and doesn't let go of the end, especially when you see it as a child. When you watch the film as an adult, one must admit that it is not so scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains many mysterious scenes (especially those with the creepy mummy). <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is undoubtedly the stage of grandfather and grandmother in their new RV; The scene with the rocks is very exciting and quite scary. Also, the scenes where the protagonist discovers his mother's secret are pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's acting in the movie isn't that big and the movie sometimes seems to be a bit boring, but generally ghosts that still go are fun. Too bad only a few people saw this movie, this movie really deserves better. I just want to say, Mr. Flocker, you've done a good job! And for all you Hollywood producers out there; To resume a movie, repeat this!
