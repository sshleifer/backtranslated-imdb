This movie is an hour or so good entertainment and has some really fun moments. I loved the character of Matt and also small. They found the most engaging and fun characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman give some welcome eyelids. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part was the brothel scene, loved it. Overall, I liked the movie and it will get an 8 rating. However, the penalty was disappointed. It was a footstool curl, rather than the appropriate lace. <br /> <br /> Of course I'm fun. :)
