I haven't seen the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I have ever seen: the questions it asked really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to boxing sports as a metaphor for the "fight before" ... thank you God that someone is hitting another angle with boxing things. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really warm. I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from Rocky movies, really wise. I thought that the chosen subject - overcome adversity and childhood traumas - is timeless, and God knows many people need it. Came with it.
