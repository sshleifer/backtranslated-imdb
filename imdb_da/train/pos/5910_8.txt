OK, okay, you won't be bent out of the round. I was fun. <br /> <br /> "Bustin Out" is actually a better and more threatening title anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Racism and criminal drama get the satirical gratuity meant by our X-rated animator friend Ralphie boy. And he does one of his better jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front, it shows the truth. They build it, defend it, so boredom and stronger rivals make them (perhaps) lose it. See for yourself what goes down. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. With Scatman (RIP) and love walrus (also RIP) is black and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on racism for the most part. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says so much. And the younger (before "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> It's an animated "Blacksploitation" movie. It is a good thing. Well done and well done. It will do some squirm (like lynching scene) but unfortunately it is based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie really should have re-enacted that title.
