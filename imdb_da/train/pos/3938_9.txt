Henry Fonda captures brilliantly what we have long believed that Abraham Lincoln was like. It's a fool. Through the performance of the Foundation, we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a nationwide cover. But through his confrontation with lynch mob and especially during the trial, you can see that under the outer postures is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, he has the timing perfectly. There is an order in the trial that made me laugh pretty hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda, who goes to the top of a hill and in the distance a huge storm symbolic of the civil war. He goes on to the story. The film is fiction, but insight into Lincoln is huge. Definitely worth seeing again.
