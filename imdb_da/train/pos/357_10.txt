The movie is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by James Eves. The film is entertaining with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham, and everyone is the perfect cast. James Eves has a good eye for casting and manages as a conductor who knows exactly when to turn the action, fall and then rise to a climax. He does this with an element of humor, lots of twists, excitement and blood. This is a return from the old vampire movie, with lots of gore, blood and screams. The movie works at great speed, and the characters take you on a fantastic adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously with lots of tongues in cheek action.
