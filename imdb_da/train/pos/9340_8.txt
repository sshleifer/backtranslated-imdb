** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy, but in "Reign" gives a profound achievement. While there are people who showed Courage against September 11,2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widow who is lonely and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his old College friend Sandler and wants to catch up with "old times". We see as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also becomes emotional and retracted in stressful situations. Oil music seems to be a consolation and "psychological" crutch that he can lean on. Johnson seeks in Fineman that there is pleasure and ease in his family. He also feels dissatisfied and dissatisfied with his job. In the same example, he will also make sure that his friend does not fall through the social "cracks". I got away from this movie with a different perspective and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families.
