At first I had not read the novel so far, and I had not heard anything about the author yet. But when I randomly saw this movie, I was completely imprisoned by the story. Already as the Jewish guards said he did not know anyone who has a bad conscience about the war except Howard W. Campbell Junior, such a great goal was to dissociate from merely moralizing the war. Terrific! And the fictional story of "the most effective spy for the United States in World War II" that has lost everything that was important to its life is wonderfully emotionally transcribed. This is the best story of human duality I have ever heard of! The questions this film introduces are, in my opinion, very important to our society: When does any guilt carry anything? What is guilt? Who is a hero and who is a criminal? What is important in our lives? Can you live without being aware of the political changes? Is the protagonist guilty or not? These questions are more up-to-date than in the last 60 years. This is a must see for anyone thinking of accepting war! This movie is a must see for anyone who meditates what matters in life and what doesn't it ...
