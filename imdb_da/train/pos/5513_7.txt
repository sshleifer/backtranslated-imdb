From what I have read many people were disappointed with this movie compared to part 1. In the beginning I could understand this, but after a bit of thinking I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues his fact-based story about Che's life, which he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution that moves from unpredictable beginnings to an ultimately successful ending. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution moving from unpredictable beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different results. He boldly chooses to tell them both in a fairly straightforward manner. The viewer may feel much better getting out of the cinema according to part 1 than part 2, but it is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any errors from the director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war when the guerrillas had successes. In part 2 they cannot take a break, and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and catch. Che's catch and death are treated well. The movie is much improved because the dialogue is in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentine. So if you have seen part 1, you will see a very similar story about a completely different story in part 2.
