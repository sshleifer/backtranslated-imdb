Another channel 4 big can of long before it's time. Forcing action by Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and fun. I remember looking at it at that time and even then asked, nobody had really heard about it. But trying to find someone now who can remember it is even harder. Maybe Channel 4 can't do their job well enough to drum the necessary enthusiasm. Whether it or the public is too interested in the TV that is Big Brother. I suppose the latter. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place asked Channel 4 to release a DVD of that series. Let's hope the same can happen with North Square.
