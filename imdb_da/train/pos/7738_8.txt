After Dark, My Sweet is a large, modern noir, filled with seedy characters, dirt roads and of course sweaty characters. It seems that most of the really big noirs in the last two or three decades have taken place in the south, where the men slip and the ladies, um, also slip. Why? Because it is hoooootttttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do it - sweaty women leave me stapled). <br /> <br /> Anyway - there may be some spoilers in here. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be - stable pacing (although some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow'), clear and broadly drawn (but not simple) characters and tons of atmosphere. Noir, about anything, is about moods and attitudes. Therefore, the big ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of "great" action (see Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that is exactly what you want. or fast paced adventures (again all the great noirs seem to be on slow burning as a cigarette). Big noirs create an environment and you only live with the signs for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet Let's Do It - and it lets us enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are exciting - never allow the audience to know what really makes them tick - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern by the way) are pitch, Dern especially (see previous comment). They take the basic sketches of a character and give them depth and evoke our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There is better plot in the noir world (hardly any mystery here - it's most excitement), but this one is solid. If so, simply 'okay' has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson, plots are almost secondary; He evaded the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger and more confusing characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and and you will see right away (from the title) what it's all about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it is about, that's how it's about it (quoting Roger Ebert). So really, the relatively simple plot of kidnapping is not supposed, and if you don't like it, well jokes on you. <br /> <br /> Why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female management. She's not bad in herself, but she's not Angelica Huston or Anette Benning (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters if you don't know what I'm talking about - besides it's a better movie and you have to start there for modern noir - It is the best of the 1990s and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best side Chinatown). She simply does not have the chops (or look for it) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. So there.
