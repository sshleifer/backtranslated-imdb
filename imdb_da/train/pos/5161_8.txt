Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but find the place abandoned, except for a Mr. Atoz, who runs a kind of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a right answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz does not care about their questions and insists that they should quickly "make a choice while there is still time". They have no idea what he is talking about, but wander about looking at the hand mirrored discs on the viewers, and they see pictures of the planet's past. So, while a disc is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like Louis XIV's time (1660s). Following McCoy and Spock is another disc in the viewer and sent to an ice age hell. Too late they are aware that the library is a time travel machine and repository. <br /> <br /> While Church's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy's much more eventful, as Spock falls head over heels to Mariette Hartley - sent to this horrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are extraordinarily interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locations make this an extraordinary episode - well worth a look. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the outstanding character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I am a big fan of older movies and have seen him as a support and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s, and he almost looked like he did in this 1969 episode. Interestingly, he lived in spite of of that he was old, another 23 years - dying over 95 years !!
