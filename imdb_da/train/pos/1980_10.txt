One of the last great musicals from the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it has always been a favorite since then. The musical songs are all memorable. In the 60s, the people cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a particular Academy Award nominated current musical based in a big city center). All the lead roles were beautifully cast ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, like Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (who fortunately did not have songs, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester comes across as an innocent waif, which was what Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers performing "think of yourself", "I would do something" "Who will buy" and "be back soon", many there were kids! This is a great show for the whole family.
