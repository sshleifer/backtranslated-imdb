One of the most interesting films to be classified as "blaxploitation", Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insights. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who are also seen in the film. The racist imagery can often disturb, but the film in the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave it an endorsement (but only bravely). I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in studying the furious atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful things.
