The Hanson Brothers - Andy (apparently having his act together) and Hank (obviously not having his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie delivers. This is a layered thoroughbred roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it does. As a crime drama / thriller, I would happily compare it to 'No Country For Old Men.' While both films have a plentiful supply of character drama and excitement, "Devil" is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and softer movie that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more fun. There is certainly less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The actress also delivers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes tree in the past, brings jitters, sweat and deer-in-headlights - look to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the movie's toughest scenes and quickly becomes the actor you think can do anything. <br /> <br /> There's really not much wrong with this movie. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. The events spiral out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from the first timer Kelly Masterson), director (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remains as tight as a drum. In many categories, this is the award-caliber thing, though movies like "The Departed" and "No Country" pushed this out of the limelight. If you liked them, you like it here.
