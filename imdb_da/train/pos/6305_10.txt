Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. An excellent ensemble cast, close editing and wonderful direction. A caper film that is not bent in standard tricks. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be said much without destroying it. The roof line says it all - 5 guys. 1 Safe. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead a fantastic cast. George Clooney must be congratulated for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
