Stylishly directed, pictorial and brilliantly acted ?? Crosby's interpretation works just right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is ​​a treat too ?? this Yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible. Of course, one of the most important joys of the movie is the songs. As can be expected, Bing is in fine voice. And even though Hardwick's solo has been cut, we can still hear him singing heartily as he happily dances with Crosby and Bendix in their famous "Busy Doing Nothing" news number. It is also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she has had an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, rarely got a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a nice voice that is more than similar to her pretty looks, and she looks very much like picking up in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget by using all the resources for his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse also looks a little confused, but who complains?) In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment dress from start to finish.
