I happened to catch this movie at a screening in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; It has many crazy characters, but let's just say I would have difficulty choosing which one made me laugh the hardest, I wouldn't know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well-written and well-behaved. <br /> <br /> There are many small details that make it unique and very comfortable, it has a few "units" that pop up and add another fun layer. It is refreshing to see; Not some recycled products I had seen many times before. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real audience-pleaser, the story is so original and fervent. <br /> <br /> There is a lot here to like, funny back stories, mishaps and misconceptions that established the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with lots of heart; It's a touching story with quick-start comedies woven all the way through. Definitely worth a look!
