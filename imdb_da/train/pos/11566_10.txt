A youth card friction. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a fun little movie where Shirley Temple steals all her scenes as heroes' lively baby sister. The open gag - which deals with bedwetting - is in bad taste but is quickly forgotten. Highlight: The climatic records that look stunningly realistic. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, the two and two wheel short topics were useful for the studio as important training places for new or emerging talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was quite different from that of a movie of its own length, something like writing a topnotch story rather than a novel. Economically producing in terms of both budget and schedule and able to depict a wide range of materials, short motifs were the perfect complement to the study's feature film.
