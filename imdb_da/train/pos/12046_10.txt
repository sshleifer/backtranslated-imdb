There is nothing far-frightening about modern "horror" which is an insult to the word "horror". Freddie Vs Jason, Scream movie, Cabin Trash, and especially Stephen King's children's track - he reused every single story from The Monkey's Paw to anything, often in the same story - in horror both in writing and on film (except Kubrick's version of The Rails that were actually scary, unlike the King's books, which are as scary as my big toe - the left that still has the nail. <br /> <br /> But The Woman In Black is the rare modern movie that will Make hair on the back of the neck stand at the end, this is how it should be done, the director creates excitement, and the scary ghost ever seen, simply by making her stand still and with somewhere the incredible look on her face, he brings it all to a horrible disturbing seal. He has learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror - Val Lewton (original Cat People) and Robert Wise (a Val Lewton disciple and director of Haunting and The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tou rnier (another Val Lewton disciple who directed a really scary zombie movie, not the rough waste Raimi did (gross is not scary, folks, it's just brutal) and Lewis Allen ( The Uninvited), and of course Jack Clayton's Henry James De innocent tour, and the way the excitement, Hitchcock, still brings you to the edge of your seat, even with a slow and burning period like Capricorn. <br /> <br /> TEN STARS ...
