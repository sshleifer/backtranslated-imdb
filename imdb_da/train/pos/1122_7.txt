Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately, they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crime, and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant low-budget surprise. The cast is equal enough, the direction is stable, and the violence is particularly unpleasant and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is pretty grim. The murderous sheriff is not one-dimensional in character a few scenes it seems he feels remorse for what he's done. The sub-plot, involving the two boys they meet in the dinner, goes nowhere but stalking scenes in the forest are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
