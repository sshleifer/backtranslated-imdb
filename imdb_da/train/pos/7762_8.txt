In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her that she should not make such films as this or that. At that time, Douglas Sirk was labeled "weepies for women", in fact he was restored in favor of least in Europe after he stopped managing. And when he filmed "written in the wind", Sirk had only three films to make: "tarnished angels", "a time to love and a time to die", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "Imitation of life" (1960). Then there was silence. In fact, Bacall and Hudson characters are not interested in Sirk. They are too straightforward and talented. Dorothy Malone - who was a kind of replacement for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack give the greatest interest to the plot. A plot built constantly, most of the film is a long feedback. The instability of the brother and sister of a family of rich Texan oil owners is brought to the forefront of garish garments and rutile cars that are at peak speed in a derrick's landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is great: dress and chignon, toying with a little derrick: she's ready for life, rebel is tamed. Now alone, because she's lost Hudson (but still he wasn't in love with her). This end is a bit reactionary, but the melodrama is par excellence reactionary, three years later, in "imitation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) is blamed for not knowing her place.
