This episode of the Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic plays and sight gags, a tribute to the early Buster Keaton movies. Lots of slapsticks: Buster falls on a sliding door, falls into a puddle, runs around pants-less. Stupid scientist's invention of a Time Helmet, reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of ​​what the future would be. Cheap prices, like $ 1.95 for ladies hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high for buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when he was mistakenly transported to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster tried to go backwards! The "scientist" of that time will return to a quieter world, 1890, which he has studied and admired. They go together again and Buster / Mulligan is now happy, and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. Then Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. It is enough. <br /> <br /> Another cute thing - longtime underutilized Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairman who fixes Time Helmet - shading his washing machine career.
