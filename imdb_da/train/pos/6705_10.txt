And it's not because since her days at "Clarissa explains it all" that I've had a little in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular, was already well into her 20s but still could Get Teenage Roles. "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big leap after her "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic book, Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - A teenage witch trying to balance her witchcraft with the demands of everyday life. She is helped in her efforts of her two aunts and a clever cracking black cat, from which she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism. As usual, the Hart show is heart and soul. "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" is quite moving and very funny, and it is a shame that it took me so long to realize how big it was. I only wish there were some recent episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
