While I was in a plane that came through the vast array of movies, I came across Live! almost by accident. Oh boy! which choice. <br /> <br /> I remember vaguely watching the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot it expects no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that this has been a hell. I can't remember the last time I've been so excited, scared. Not sure if it was the high altitude that played with my senses, but the tension gradually grows through the film until you reach a climax where you can't turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you have I have. <br /> <br /> You will first review a personal moral assessment of where you are about the fairness of the show. You will drift off thinking "how can man be so vicious" to "why not after all?". Ask yourself, would you do it. Then you learn about the participants, their motives and start guessing. You will then see the participant pulling the trigger one by one and being excited, even though you know the first candidate is safe. Good play, good director with a movie experience that reminds you of the old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene, but still wanted more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * few things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - casting participants. I've really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a little stupid, it felt like you didn't care about some of the participants. Although this may have been done on purpose, I believe the audience should have been able to connect with the majority of participants. - Game rules, a big mistake: <br /> <br /> What happens if the fifth participants do not die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think that the last standing guy will pull the trigger and perform himself !!! they should have given all participants the opportunity to live, ie: if 5. is also a plot, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> Interestingly I haven't been bothered too much by these bad points because I really enjoyed it. just wish i had some popcorn with me!
