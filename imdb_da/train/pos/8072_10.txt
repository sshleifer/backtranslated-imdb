Magnificent and unforgettable, amazingly atmospheric and brilliant by all. I really can't understand what kind of people are panning this masterpiece and giving mostly votes like 8 (and nine of them!) <Br> <br /> This, along with Wrath grapes, is John Ford's biggest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though it is right back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. It deserves a 12.
