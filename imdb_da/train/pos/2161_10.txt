How many of us want to be able to throw social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suppose. Shall we Dance? is not a movie about dance. It's about learning about ourselves and acknowledging what we are looking for in life and having the courage to hunt for it. Sir. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese community where ballroom dancing is considered inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out the window of a dancing acadamy. He is fascinated by her and eventually represents dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dance and is afraid of ridicule. He conceals the fact that he participates in dance courses from his colleagues and family. <br /> <br /> There is a fun scene in the office room when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted by practicing some dance moves. There are many other fun and warm-hearted scenes. The end is not an adventure, but it leaves the viewer feeling good. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand Japanese people a little better. It's a warm and very worth watching movie.
