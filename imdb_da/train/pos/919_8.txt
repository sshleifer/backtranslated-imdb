Having been a fan of 'Columbo' I was very disappointed with 'Corky Romano'. Although it was a fun movie, Falks mobboss character was far from the beloved lieutenant he played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After the 'Corky Romano', I was honestly both surprised and soured by Mr Peter Falk. But I've just seen "Find John Christmas" and its predecessor, "A city without Christmas", for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that 'Max', Peter's Falk is lovely character in both films, is safe as memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'. While parts of the movie are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away from the pleasure of watching the story play. I also wish I had recorded both these heartfelt Christmas videos, and I strongly recommend them to be a Falk fan, a Christmas nut, or just someone who enjoys the occasional sensitive movie of the week. This movie may end up being lost among the many TV holiday flicks, so be sure to find 'Find John Christmas' before it's too late.
