Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. As I grew up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS copy of this movie when we purchased a new VHS system. First my mother wasn't sure that this was a suitable movie for a 10-year-old, but because we had just bought a new VHS system, I let myself see it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is every little boy's dream ?? The movie features a fantastic setting, great muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, great bad monsters and jokes you only get when you get older. So a few days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first I started to get bored and started thinking about how much I loved this movie when I was a kid and continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as great as I remembered ?? The play is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer fun, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I'm an adult. Although the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the good old times you know ??
