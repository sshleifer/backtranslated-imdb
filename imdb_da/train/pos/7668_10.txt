I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is amazing in it. Plays the role of the modern troll for the hilt. (And is quite sweet.) 2) The movie helped inspire a role play I enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it to different LARP parties, and it's always a big hit. D&D loves and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and thoroughly enjoyable. The reason is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good at such a low budget, and the script, while no star, was not so badly done and cheesy at all the right places. A great way to spend an evening.
