Takashi Miike's entry into the kiddie territory won me almost immediately because he demonstrates the nerve and the courage to deal with fantasy elements. This is an adventure that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something scary about most adventures; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic narratives are a little scary (and more disturbing) than they seem to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypal story of a child on a wonderful mission out of preschool education. He highlights the very real fear of a world filled with endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness of bedtime stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes to the jugular story, but he also shows signs of restraint. But a self-owned Miike is still alien to most filmmakers. I thought it was a good movie. Highly recommended.
