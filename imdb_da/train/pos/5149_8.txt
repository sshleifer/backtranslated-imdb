This is a lukewarm docu-drama that doesn't cover any new ground, shakes all the clich√©s and is sloppy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but a ceasefire. Yet it is advertised as a surrender. For example, European news providers have not (and not) shouted headlines as they raise their papers. Yet this is strictly American custom in the movie. For example, the Nazis did not make the German eagle until they had taken power, but there is it in the lecturer when Hitler delivers one of his stem winners. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than the Hitler words. The film also continues the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched in the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a fine portrayal of his subject. But his support case is at best adequate and very often not even that. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope the other gets better, but not bet on it.
