I've seen it here every night on VH1 this past week. This is a fantastic revealing portrait of the drug chemistry and how drugs were shown in the media in the late 60s and beyond through the 70s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, Morrison's Death, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has designed a complete intricate depiction of life and times during "Drug Years". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54, this documentary shows the evolution and progress of the drug business and death and new life that breathed into American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentary shows how drugs came into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance and how drugs performed art (music, movies, etc.) with lots of fascinating interviews and news rolls. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
