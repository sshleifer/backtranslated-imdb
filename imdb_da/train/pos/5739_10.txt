Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of fraternal love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky) a mildly mentally handicapped young man who puts his 12 minutes younger, twin brother, Liotta, who plays Eugene through medical school. It is set in Baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry, the twin's unbreakable ties, child abuse and good always wins beyond evil. It is captivating and full of laughter and tears. If you haven't seen this movie yet, remember to hire the one I promise you will be surprised at how such a wonderful movie could go without comment.
