Unfortunately, the director Amos Guttman died from Aids-related diseases the following year to make this movie, so we do not know how many more gay movies we might have had from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, on Amazon, but it seems that none of his other works is still available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) features full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines that turn into a desire-seeking dream sequence. and some drug use. This is the story of two families coming by or trying to, but the mothers, daughters and homosexuals all have their own problems to figure out. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets next neighbor Thomas, who of course has his own problems. Either the translations are a little weak, or maybe Guttman kept the conversation sparing with that purpose, too little mystery. When we see this, I get the feeling that we don't get the whole story, but it's okay. Throw in a cute homosexual roommate ex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who continued to make many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worrying about the mothers. A great blues song "All Night Long Blues" made by an unknown female artist; If she is listed in the credits, it was unfortunately not translated into English. Nice to see mothers and siblings treat gay relationships with respect, just like any other relationship. But then the United States has always been years behind other countries in this way. A great way to spend 98 minutes ... I wanted to see even more of it. Won prizes at several film festivals, according to IMDb and the film jacket.
