Pop Quiz: You're part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine maneuvers, and you'll find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change the story. What are you doing? Well, if you are a Hollywood studio, change the Japanese G.I.s in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) for the crew of a US airline, get them to debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise: throwing back 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of coming back lies in provocative history by trying to change it by to join a warlord to conquer the land ?? cue lots of tank and helicopter vs samurai action, including a very impressive unmatched 25 minute battle sequence with a cast of thousands causing serious damage to each other. And yes, that is beheader. Of course things do not go as planned, and even superior firepower does not stand up and hope for thousands of soldiers. Even before that, the soldiers fall out with each other in those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and plunder hell of it. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought out, soft stones and land and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they contain English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who cannot audibly speak the words or even speak the language, but it is a forgiveness mistake in a surprisingly good sci-fi player. <br /> <br /> Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the unknown 138-minute version.
