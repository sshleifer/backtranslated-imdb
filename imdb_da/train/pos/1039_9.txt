I have seen this movie several times and saw it today (on TCM) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underrated actress and I have to admit that I have had a crush on her since I first saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). However, the real star of this movie is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the acclaim he received. He makes it clear whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the funds. Naziism had to be stopped and everything that helped to do it was good. He gave his children a line to be bad and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when he spoke to adults, he would do this again without hesitation. Lukas gave an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made clear that what he was doing was a very difficult thing to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I don't think so - I think he was after the money. His Nazi staff knew it, and therefore they did not need much for him. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the movie, and probably also in the play, is that Muller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti-German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in World War II, there was considerable anti-German sentiment, and some Germans were interred like what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestors. It was something of a bravery for Hellman to write a game about good Germans at this time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi Soviet Pact!). After all, the American and British air forces bombed German cities and have no trouble killing innocent civilians. However, I think the bombardment and the four-storm in Dresden happened later after the "Watch on the Rhine" was released. <br /> <br /> The title is a game of words, as the "clock" looks west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song - used in World War II, but the Nazis had their own marching song, which was also used. But Muller is German, and he is engaged in his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All the other actors did an excellent job here; Although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he didn't give away his father's secret. In real life, he may well have done so.
