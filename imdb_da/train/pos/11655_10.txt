There are far too many topics to be avoided in the cinema, and eating disorders is one of them. This movie shows it as it is. It is not glamorized for the viewers to enjoy, it is shown with true truth that makes it more powerful. I've only seen it once and it was a few years ago, but I still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. That's what movies should be about - they should be there to help people and not glamorize things that are wrong.
