I laughed a lot while I looked at this. It is an entertaining card with a fun musical action and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor of stylization. The dialogue is fun and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last, everything just seems to flow wonderfully. There is Max who apparently has led a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what to look for. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended to anyone who likes silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he's coming up with next.
