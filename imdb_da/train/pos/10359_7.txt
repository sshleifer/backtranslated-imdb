Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's got fun doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, who portrayed here, was not very sympathetic, nor was it all wise. But it just makes Streep's work more remarkable. I think she's worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the movie, yes, there were a few interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the public played a major role in history. I had pretty much missed it when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems that the Australian press has just been achieved by misery and overkill as their American counterparts. A really good movie. A little different. Degree: B
