"Such a long journey" is a well-made film, a good shot and a showcase for some good performances. The story, however, is such a pick of subplots and peculiar signs that it becomes a kind of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences are likely to find esoterics in the rather unclear Parsee culture a little to get their arms around for 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.
