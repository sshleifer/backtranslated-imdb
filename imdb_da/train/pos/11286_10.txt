I recommend watching this movie with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan like Tarzan and Jane is so steamy that it can withstand your screen. After the original movie, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan protest when Jane covers their visitors highlights that they are not only romantic but also sexually in love. A fantasy can complement the constantly touching and love conversation between Tarzan & Jane showing how much Jane actually teaches Tarzan about love emotionally, romantic, and sexually. And Jane's students are not only embracing but also thriving with their previously unexploited sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is out of the charts. In addition to Jane's two-part sexy midriff, leg and hip childrens clothing, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (Although not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, who doubles her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a huge body and perfect pectorals in his scanty loins. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller comes out of the water after his long struggle with the giant crocodile and sounds his cry - with his watery soaked lingerie falling practically from his hips. It is a pity that the overprotective censors toned down the adult character of Tarzan after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films will still thrive in the coming years, they would rarely approach the sex complaint to this movie.
