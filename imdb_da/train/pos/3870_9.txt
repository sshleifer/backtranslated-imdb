This is an extremely dense, gloomy and complicated movie that unravels quite slowly and reveals spooky details like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this movie "is" like seeing a novel unfold. While I didn't care for the narrator when I felt he was out of balance with the rest of the shows, this movie has some of the best ensemble actions I've ever seen, and the lead, Summer Phoenix, is fabulous. Her innocence and naive some can find incredible, kind crosses between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that criticism, but she's still fabulous, partly because she's unlike anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly beautiful, occupied by Eric Gautier and part of what is so unique about this movie is how it never shows what you would expect. It is always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals more than is necessary. In 163 minutes, it is extremely concise, an error I will say, which is one of the wonders of this movie. It's packed with short moments that are simply amazing, some of the best you'll probably see throughout the year, and all those moments ultimately add to an extraordinary movie experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this film has to say about the theater has not been seen in movies since Cassavete's "Opening Night" or perhaps Chaplin's "Limelight". But believe it or not, this movie is much "less" conventional. I never knew where this movie went, and now I have seen several options. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
