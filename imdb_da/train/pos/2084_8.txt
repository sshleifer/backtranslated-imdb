My main problem with the movie is that it goes too long. Other then it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is getting married through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid who gets married to Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm, and they do it pretty badly. When he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing grows. All stars are north as Muni continues to be first. When they leave and arrive in the city, they find that they are not jobs and they are worse off than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but deciding against it. When a lot of people start plundering the city, the military shows and begins to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won another oscar for this movie.
