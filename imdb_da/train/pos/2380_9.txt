I didn't mind everyone walking. People really started going again. It lent an authenticity to this period and a few perspectives on Martian's technologies. I was also disappointed with the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this movie enough for its faithfulness to Well's story! It's about time. The actors like it and the performance is charming. Also, this movie is very worth watching just to hear Jamie Hall's truly amazing musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor playing both the author and his brother in London.
