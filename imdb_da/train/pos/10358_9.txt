I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see it again and fall over my heels in love with this movie. The story behind the film is fascinating in itself. The cast just makes it so much more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely on top of her game in this picture. She nails Mrs Chamberlain's way, accent and even looks. She shows the pain, evil, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is difficult to remember that it is not Lindy. In my opinion, this performance by Meryls was better than his Oscar-winning Turn in "Sophie's Choice" and should have gotten her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for a surprising reason he was not recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination. All in all, this film only receives an Oscar button (Streep's for Best Actress.) However, it received several Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a top-rate movie: it tells a great story and you get amazing performances from all over.
