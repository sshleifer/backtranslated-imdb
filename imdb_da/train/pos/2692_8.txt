I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a really good direction at the already known Bigas Luna, which was born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the film takes place, in Catalu√±a, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Once again, Luna explores the theme of a reception, in this case a young boy's boy for milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story as the rejection complex that the older son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film, this is what leads to the young boy's reception, which suddenly sees all his mother's milk to the newly born son. So he starts trying to find a breast that is capable of feeding him. He finds it in a woman who has recently arrived, and from here is the film around it. <br /> <br /> This film is very much in imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually matters ...). The surroundings, the landscapes typical of the region as well as the surrealistic behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the incredible ambiguous soundtrack of Nicola Piovani transports us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which cuts it from times to time ... Worth living in that world, worth looking at this movie, although we might eventually, and at the moment, get tired and a little sick with the excessive reception that may have been beyond the borders ... <br /> I also enjoyed the protagonist's performance ... 8/10
