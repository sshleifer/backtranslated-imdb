Beware of this. When you get used to it, it will change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will long for a plot from all the kung-fu movies now, you will have character depth and development, you will require mystery and unpredictability, you will require dynamic camera work and incredible scenery. Unfortunately, you won't find all these aspects together in a kung-fu movie, except for Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung-fu movie of all time, Venoms blends a rich plot full of twists with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best cameras coming out of 70 's. The success of a person who likes the movie depends on the viewers' ability to decipher what character is and who specializes in which poison. One is Centipede, two are the snake, three are Scorpio, four are Lizard, and five are the race. Each character has different traits, properties, strengths and weaknesses. Here lies the hook, we learn together with the student character and find out who these different men turn out to be. We are in his shoes (so to speak) and we must choose who we trust and who we do not, just as he does. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters and the camera great, it's also fun to see, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of that kind. It's worth getting a few watches to pick up everything that goes on. Venomer is a lesson on what kung-fu really can do ... just don't expect many other kung-fu movies to live up to that tail.
