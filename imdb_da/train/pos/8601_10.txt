My Comments: The Vamp outfit at the end is incredible and wonderful, exotic and amazing. Jeanette carried it well and stayed with naive Nelson. Boat crashed into its balcony served him right. Costume clothing by his female mafia was designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did good work. Main song theme just lovely. <br /> <br /> Caution to negative posters: 1942 was the time of WW II; Pearl Harbor happened the year before. The United States just comes out of great depression; need to get out and spend the hard earned money on the diversion of song, dance and yes, fantastic imagination. Despotic dictators tried to exclude them in RL and eradicate freedoms. The goodness of the public had these amazing plot line movies to participate. Movie going was a privileged treat, in the depressing times. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and criticize. Jeanette's and Nelson's films are tested by the time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings are wonderful, on the real angel. RL wings on costume party not so hot, but fantastic on Jeanette considering SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful song by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette dance was a pure joy. <br /> <br /> 15/10
