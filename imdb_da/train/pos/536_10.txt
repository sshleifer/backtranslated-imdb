Few movies can be seen almost 60 years later, but remain as enchanting as this one. Technological advancement has not dated this classic love story. Used special effects are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The action is amazing. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an excellent job. The use of black and white / color adds the creative character of the movie. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are even aware of its existence. It's my favorite movie all the time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death.
