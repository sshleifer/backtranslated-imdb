There was no dry eye among the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema when I saw this gem of a movie in a sold out house as part of this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the tears shook were all laughter. This movie was fun, there is no other way to say this. There was not a dull bit in it, I laughed right through it and with me all other of us three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was amazing. A great clown if necessary and serious if the situation so requires. The performance was, of course, all over the top, but it was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. Just as great was Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to see a lot, and the mother was also a very strong achievement. The sisters could have been a little more detailed in character script-wise, but apart from that there is nothing to complain about. I had a lovely afternoon watching this movie while Hamburg drowned outside, and I wish that such films from France would get a regular release in Germany. But the distributors are this country, do not seem to understand that the French do good movies. At least I can't wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because the movie I need at home to watch several times!
