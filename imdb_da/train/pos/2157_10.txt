Okay. As you can see, this is one of my favorites, if not favorite movies. This is a character drama that is quite fun. The protagonist is a businessman who is stuck in a "same thing, second day" mentality. He sees a woman who sees melancholy out of a window in a dance studio from her train every day and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class to find out that she is not an instructor. From there he binds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman. There is no congratulations (or any) gender involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This movie was restored with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new one is appealing, nowhere as comfortable as the original. The movie has never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscar, as it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on television or disqualified for Oscar nominations). It won many awards in Japan for best film, cast, director, etc. for their "Oscar" awards.
