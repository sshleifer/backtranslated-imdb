An amazing Arabic adventure. A former king, Ahmad and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) are seeking Ahmad's love, which has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a moment here. It always discovers new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (there is no need to ask why John Justin who plays Ahmad is listed fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a big villain, and Sabu is very fun as the thief's prince, who at one point finds a genius in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson as the sultan of Basra, the father of the princes. He collects amazing toys from all over the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanically flying horse. This will probably count as one of the great children's films from any time, but the special effects are terribly dated today. Children will surely divert the superimposed images when Abu and the genius are on the screen together. And the scene with the giant spider looks particularly awful. Although most of the younger generation probably think King Kong looks bad at this time, Willis O'Brins stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look distant like a spider. 8.10.
