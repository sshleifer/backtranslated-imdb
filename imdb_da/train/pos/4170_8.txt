I've seen this movie more than once. It was on a par with a lot of ghostly things that were shown in television movies at that time. The only problem I had was with the title of the obvious reasons ... You immediately think of the famous snack cake of Drake's! Abandoning the first part, 'Hell of Hell' would have been sufficient. Richard Crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to something he does - anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But this was a fun Halloween prize offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a plane to a blurred land to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil animal. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna regarding the cabby's own people's ethnic faiths. "Oh, Mr Barry, I left those things behind when I came down from the mountains ..." - refers to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> So far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still fun.
