1958. The sleepy little southern town of Clarksburg. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in peak form) bursts very hard at speed by forcing those offenders from a rock to their incredible deaths on a particularly dangerous road. Childress meets with his fight when the cool young hot rod drives Michael McCord (an excellent smooth and brooding depiction of Martin Sheen) popping up in the city in his complementary car with the specific intention of abolishing his brother's death (Sheen's true siblings Joe Estevez in a short como). Director Richard T. Heffron, working from an intriguing and exciting script by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 70's recording film "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), relate the gripping story to a lively pace , creating a tasteful 50-year period setting, and announcing lots of excitement out of the tense game of wild and willingness between Childress and McCord. The consistent fine cast helps a lot: Sheen exudes a brash James Deanesque rebellion headline, Morrow makes the most of his flabby stupid part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet dining waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin as a folksy substitute , Nick Nolte, as the gracious gas station's companion Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as sassy local tart Sissy, Britt Leach as the stingy taxi driver Johnny and Frederic Downs as a crook Judge JA Hooker. The climatic vehicular confrontation between Childress and McCord is a true pulse-pounding white bone exciting doozy. Terry K. Meades sharp filmography, the well-drawn characters (for example, Childress was obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and child were killed in a deadly hit and run event), the groovy syncopated score of Luchi De Jesus and the beautiful mountain side scenes All further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-TV winner.
