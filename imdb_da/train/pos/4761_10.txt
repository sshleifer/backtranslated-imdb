An excellent movie with amazing performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to their dissatisfaction (& min) came Garibaldi at the station. (With respect for Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It doesn't take him long to start criticizing Zack (which I love best of all on the show) and taking responsibility. I'm sure Zack could have done it. The Soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky that Zack does. The mood complements it nicely. 10.10
