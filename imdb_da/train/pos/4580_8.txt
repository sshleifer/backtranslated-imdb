Princess Tam Tam is without racism in the way we think of racism in the US, but there are more subtle (to American viewers) claims of ethnic identity in time. Pay attention to Alwinas (Baker) location within shots, how she is treated by the other characters, the settings around her, all of which depict her as a "wild" African, and ask yourself if Alwina has any organic matter throughout the film. I will not destroy anything, but ultimately pay very careful attention, dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is to say the least offensive, such diction is fortunately rejected these days. The French have a checkered past as an imperial force in the depicted areas (see Chris Markers Les Statues Meurent Aussi-1953) and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while in Africa, and what do they reflect on their attitudes toward "others". I give this movie a 7 because I'm a sucker for Baker, much of what she did in her professional career as Princes Tam Tam, the regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts at integration, her work as a freaking vomit (I'm gushing , sorry.) But the movie for me is captivating because of her performance, besides it is a narrative relic of past mentalities.
