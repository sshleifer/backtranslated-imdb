Well, I said everything in the summary, I simpley love the movie and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I am 25 now and I saw it 4 times in different periods and I always think i will not cry and i always do, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, jeremy irons too .. just brilliant ... i want the movie received several awards ... i really don't know anyone who looked at it and loved it ... too, glenn close was fantastic. ... the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that after all, Clara and Esteban loved each other so much and how Blanca was close to her parents ...
