Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I am not very interested in spy stories, and I did not know this. The only reason I saw it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw the "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film gave me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was fantastic, but it was also the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentary with hidden secret messages to the Americans, he actually contributed to the Germans' general attitude (and as it later turns out, Americans) against Jews or hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent, since these words are never spoken, not even as a narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learned to hide his emotions so perfectly that he does not open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the excellent play and photography this film handles. <br /> <br /> There are other points to it, such as humor or ironic use of romantic clich√©s (such as the song White Christmas) that make it quite different from the average American movie. I recommend it to anyone bored with Hollywood spy movies.
