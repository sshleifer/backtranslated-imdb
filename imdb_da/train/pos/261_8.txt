I went to see this movie expecting a lovely relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I really had to control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways still a children's story, but with a manuscript that has many possibilities. Could have been one of the scariest movies if scheduled for another audience.
