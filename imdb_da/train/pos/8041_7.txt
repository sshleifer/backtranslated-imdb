Despite some negative comments made by this movie on the IMDb pages, it is still worth seeing as it is a story of survival and companionship between two different men with different mentalities in a difficult mission in the Panamanian jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa brings us together to see this thriller in Panama. The movie has some great moments, such as Beckett, the veteran lake, taking a newly arrived man who has recently been sent to attempt to remove an infamous drug cartel and the corrupt army general who may be the vice-president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience of what he has been awarded. <br /> <br /> Miller, the arrogant newcomer to the jungle and to the guerrilla war between the military and the drug addicts against infiltrated US intelligence, learns a valuable lesson from Beckett. It looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is an actor who doesn't record much as he proves in this movie, but in connection with the movie, he's just like a few words man. Billy Zane plays Miller doing what he can with a role that cannot afford him any glory at the crucial end. <br /> <br /> For action movie lovers, "Sniper" offers a 112 minute action that, with a little trim, would have made a more satisfying movie.
