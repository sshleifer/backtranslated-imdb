I have been fascinated by this movie for some time, partly because of the extremely high score here on IMDb - a 9.0 average with over 300 votes giving it the highest rating of any available audio movie! How had I not heard about this movie before this site? Well, you can't always rely on the ratings. This is actually a very good movie, preserved quite well if the fine VHS transfer I rented is an indication - excellent plays by the instructors, especially William Haines as Brown, and good location work in Cambridge with some fine action footage in it climatic Harvard / Yale football match - but history must have seemed like a hoary chestnut even in 1926. Outrageous, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place and becomes a caring, self-sacrificing friend; I doubt that people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few wheels, the prediction factor is high. Nevertheless, it begins very well and is certainly deserved to be remembered if not praised for heaven. Perhaps the former 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... EDIT Now the 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2! Seriously, people are there a ballot stuffing is going on here - I defy anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
