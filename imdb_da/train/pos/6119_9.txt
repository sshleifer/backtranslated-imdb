Okay, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I read how people changed it with the Michael version, and that's a good trick in my opinion, because some adults hate horrors, and when they see this, it will get them interested in horror movies like this or maybe (never seen) horror ( possibly comedy) Uncle Sam, I have to look to rent or buy that movie, but the other one is far better than this one, but I bought it on VHS in Amazon and got on November 21 the day before Thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. on this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
