I had to watch this movie on a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard on a movie and still being moved by it. Laughter is not gags here - they are observations, laughs at recognition, small shocks at "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I don't want to give away the plot, which is more than just "Guy falls in love with his brother's boyfriend." The whole family plays a role in the relationship here. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth since "while you were sleeping." <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than he has gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. Cast is fantastic, a list of veteran theater actors that I have loved in other roles, but they interfere with making a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as a mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and fun (who knew she was fun?), And even the spoiled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet and touching performance. Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition and I buy the CD the other one it is available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one.
