Very few films have influenced American culture that Urban Cowboy has. Thank goodness it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class of its own as one of the flicks that when you flip channels at. At 3pm, you just can't see your eyes .... my top three is Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but it's next to the point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit theaters and overnite opened honkytonks on every corner, men were sporting cowboy hats with their ear loafers, and if you didn't know how two-step you were considered a social moron! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on SatNiteFever's heels. Who had a tunk. In fact, he is also trustworthy. The soundtrack is fantastic. Too bad Charlene Tilton, of TV's Dallas fame destroyed Johnny Lee's career because that guy was just amazing. The show steals here is Scott Glenn as the foster ex-con redneck cowboy. And I don't mind fatigue ex-con cowboys semi-being a myself, but I've always envied it, I feel like being the greatest power line all the time .... "Pack-at S * # t!" Clint's "make my day." And seeing him turn Sissy around is the closest I want to look to my Julia Roberts imagination so ..... As I said, beautiful. 9.10
