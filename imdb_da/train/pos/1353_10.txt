The game is different and now they have taken a different approach, we have street-smart teams "Networth" vs. the supposed professional team "Magna" but boy, if you think the street's clever team would have trouble you would be right. While the Magna team has struggled at times, the street team has simply disintegrated every week. <br /> <br /> First, some things to repeat, as far as "apprentice 3" is concerned, continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: If your good project manager but you lose, the team will turn you on and you're fired, even though your reluctant teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs. Simply absurd, a game show that claims to employ the best candidate actually "grazes" the best while the dysfunctional candidates support each other until one is back and that person is the best. lol <br /> Anyone this season has seen a total forgery, backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes performed as teams are trying to make campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner the three are the only ones I feel were unfairly fired by Trump, the rest really did, as they only provoked conflict, anger and suffering. It's just amazing, as a candidate, Audrey Evans, said how she did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's "The Apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing and always popular everyone's up on the project manager's mentality rules. <br /> <br /> It has been an entertaining tour, but the candidates are given a variety of photo shoot tasks for mini golf golf construction, for the construction of new apartments. Even though it is still "apprentice", then all you can do is basically laugh at all the time as madness and chaos record until the lucky person is the winner.
