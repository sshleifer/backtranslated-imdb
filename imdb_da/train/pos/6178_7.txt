Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility by controlling a musical after his former films were great dramas. He also plays a como as a leader. <br /> <br /> You can see it's a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the US for a while afterwards (like 30+ years). The rent shot the musical numbers so they were as the audience would see - no widescreen shot or from above ala Busby Berkeley. What I find fun or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the leaders are quite characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie characters. However, Gertrude Michael gives a little sparkle. <br /> <br /> The musical tracks are interesting and some good (especially Rapeody's Rape is entertaining), but the drama is convincing and false - three murders are too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been much better.
