I would like CÃ©line and Jessie to move forward in their relationship, I will tell them that they were made to each other, that we in a lot of moment in the film want them to die for each other. Their story is what we have ever wanted, and most of us probably never did. It's about love, but not stupid things like in "notting hills" or that kind of movie. This is life, and I believed in them, I thought they fell ... It was so wise and touching. I just finished watching it a moment ago and I'm still there ... I'd like to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. I have to say that I now became misanthropic and felt that if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie I understood that maybe somewhere in some way when something can really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and didn't know well July Delpy despite Kieslowski's "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her second works because she looks like an angel and has a perfect play. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (successor in Paris) a few days before I saw "before sunrise" and theirs doesn't matter. They are both masterpieces. evidence that you do not have to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry my English, which I try to best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
