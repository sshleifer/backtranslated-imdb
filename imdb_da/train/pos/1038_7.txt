Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But for me, Mrs Davis' very poor attempt at accent, and her stiff action really makes an otherwise compelling movie very difficult to see. Seriously, if another modern actor played the same role in the same style as Mrs Davis, they would be laughing at the screen. I really think she called this one. Now, if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing that part of the wife, I would have had much more. <br /> <br /> I think I just don't 'get' Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor who "plays herself" no matter what role she is in. The possible exception is Now Voyager. I am sure that many of the other reviewers will explain carefully (and I hope the bourgeois) details how I am totally wrong with this. But I will continue to watch the movies she's in because I like the stories / writing / support casts, but I always think of different actresses who could have done a better job.
