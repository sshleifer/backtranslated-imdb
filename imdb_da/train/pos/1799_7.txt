I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a good couple. This movie is really fun and I love the songs. My favorite songs are "You can't keep a good dog down" and the song about sharing, I think it's called "What's My, is yours". This was the last movie with Judith Barsi who played Anne-Marie's voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find Itchy's voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still find it hard to see the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares crapen out of me. Other characters like King Gator I found great fun. The finish was cute and was actually sad, making me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
