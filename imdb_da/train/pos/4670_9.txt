Those who only remember the late Mr Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to find out this charming piece of late 60's satire. Ustinov stars as a condemned outlaw (we see him first in his last day yesterday, preparing the prison governor's tax return), which, by feeling the future in computers, constitutes (using a clear piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate a US multinational. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who wrote with the script) is on top form, like the lovely Maggie Smith, here exceptionally cast as an inappropriate exposed cockney sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts on an entertaining performance as a suspicious executive who has design at Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfactorily dizzy as Ustinov and Newhart's female boss. <br /> <br /> What can I especially like about this movie? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie', but it is also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumble in love (the whole stage of card games is particularly effective.) So what's not to like? Well, the script is no more computer literate than most movies (it's almost not), though it captures the feel of the late '60s great iron business computing quite well. There are also a few small plot glitches that you probably won't notice until the second or third view, but I consider these to be smaller niggles. As I said, this is a movie that is worth searching out, and after you have seen it, you would like to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
