"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialogues in recent memory. Seeing this comedy, directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, reminded us of perhaps another movie we had seen before, but when we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to find that what we were reminded of , 1958 was Italian movie "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to depict all the characters in the movie. All along with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter in it, can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece, all characters get a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie presents us a group of inane would be safe crackers from hell. No one could believe that these men could do a job like the one they undertake. Whatever might go wrong and more, that's what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a little look like the master's safe cracker, who is also seen as a sequel to a rabbi, to confuse only a priest with gang leaders coming out of Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little time sketches do their thing. Let their fun lines make you laugh, as everyone can see that this gang is judged from the beginning to the end!
