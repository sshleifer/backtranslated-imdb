This documentary (now available for free at Video.Google.Com) is a great demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see this. <br /> <br /> In 1998, Chavez was elected as a country-wide reconciliation. His platform was to divert the amazing oil wealth from the 20% middle class to 80% poor. He banned foreign drift net fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slum to treat the sufferers for free. He wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on the oil company profits that got him into trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, Irish film producers interviewed Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain Chavez in the Presidential Palace on his social programs, launched a CIA-supported coup. With the cameras rolling, Chavez was caught and flown out of the country. It was announced on national television that he had "retired". <br /> <br /> But the poor in Venezuela did not believe in the media. They went to the palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned to coup leaders and the plotters fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
