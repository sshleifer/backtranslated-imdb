David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, quite good) is a lawyer, more capable of dealing with corporate taxation (.. and suffering from unusual dreams that disturb him to see this aboriginal man shrouded in the dark) who is urged to take a case on a group of aborigines accused of murdering one of their own names Billy. We see that he is trying to steal stones with ritual paintings on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "dead body" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, David revolves around bizarre weather patterns affecting Sydney as rain, knocking down contaminated dirt and rocky hail under bright blue skies (without clouds like the one hitting a school in central Australia), not to mention a " deformed "rainbow, divided (!) into groups. When David pursues the case, he finds that he is much closer to the strange events that take place than he could ever realize. An aboriginal named Chris (David Gulpilil) looks to him in a dream of a stone with blood, and he finds that this man is one of those he has to represent during the trial! He finds it quite possible, after some strange meetings with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he can very well be associated with a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real premonitions of possible horrors that do not yet come . <br /> <br /> Absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's history methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is visually arrested as we see these very overwhelming images of possible judgments against civilization, but the film's most compelling angle is certainly David's journey to find the monumental truth that plagues him while he asks Charlie and Chris countless Initially, to help his men come out of a crime, they did not, and ultimately, find out what he has to do with something disastrous that occurs or may occur later.
