In the near future, the ordinary man over any suspicious suburb of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is employed by Digicorp, a large corporation to be awarded as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, Sunways. During his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity by Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, he approaches the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who advises him that nothing is what it seems to be. Morgan recognizes a new reality where he doesn't know who can trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a great surprise to me. This film has not been released in Brazil, but the exciting and exciting story is quite complex, with many plot points and with great manuscript, direction and performances. In the very first twist I reminded Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I really didn't like the last scene when the independent spy disposes of the disputed disc in the ocean. You only know the director Vicenzo Natali from the amazing "Cube" and this other work I see is also great. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
