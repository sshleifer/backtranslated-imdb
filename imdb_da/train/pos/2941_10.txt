This is the ultimate one-man show where Eddie Murphy has the very best. Just forget about Nutty Professor and Distinguished Gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending he is gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are kittens. I think it is also quite daring to make fun with artists who are very popular in that time. My favorite act is the one where he is on his annual BBQ with the family and plays his drunk father and Aunt Bunny falling from the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel down! If you see the sequel 'Raw' not be disappointed. It is also quite good, but does not suit 'Delirious'.
