Real touching story of a recruitment camp in America where young men are prepared for the Vietnam War. The human investigation always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, war action films, where action and technical data are analyzed to the detriment of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The movie manages to spin a new age-old subject and refrains from conventional war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the traditional standard of view. The film focuses on Bozz's tragic character, which cleverly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control of his fate and fight for something he does not believe, uses his energy to seek ways to avoid being sent abroad, both for himself and for comrades and ironically, end up finding his own just cause for finally going to war. Perfect irony. The action is quite unusual and the documentary filming almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also, the film will give food to thoughts for those who are excited by the action of usual war movies or war game enthusiasts. Hopefully some minds awaken in a generation who happily escaped the terror of being drafted.
