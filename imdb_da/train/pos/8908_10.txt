First, I hadn't seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 and seeing it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages could be written on their influence on horror movies even today. And even more could be written on his social subtitles with the fifties "fear of teenagers". But this simple little story of interplanetary horrors is still a shameful, scary movie if you let it be. It's probably cheesy, since everyone comes out in our modern world. But "The Blob" packs in some really scary moments when a band of children tracks the unstoppable being when adults don't believe in them. In fact, there are even some rather bleak moments in its candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story earned on paper that we viewers really get caught up in the moment and believe in him. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you can take off your postmodern iron filter, there is much more to love here than meeting the eye.
