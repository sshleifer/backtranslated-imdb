I saw this tape, immediately rewound it, saw it again and laughed twice as hard. I highly recommend this bond to those who are not hateful but unpleasant about transvestites. It shows you that transvestitism is a function rather than the whole of one's being. Comedy is not a simple problem. This man is brilliant. All comics should strive for his level of joy, intelligence and talent.
