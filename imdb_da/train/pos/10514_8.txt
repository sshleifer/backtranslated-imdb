Emma is a horrible movie based on Jane Austen's classic novel. I haven't read the book, so I didn't know much about the plot, and yet I still predicted almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the poor writing or guidance. However, for some reason the movie is very entertaining and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I didn't like, but the majority were well-acted and fun. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the hero of Emma. The movie is also the star Toni Collette (Who is good, but it has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who has also been better, but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming (Who has I never really been impressed and is big seen the same here) and Jeremy Northam (who's the show is rather wood in the first place but actually quite subtle, even if it wasn't what was needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books, but this one is still very entertaining and worth a look.
