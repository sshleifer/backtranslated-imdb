Gung Ho is trying to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character quite well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supportive role. Otherwise, this is quite enjoyable time capsule.
