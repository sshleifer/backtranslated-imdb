"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically pops pop culture into humorous self-destruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 40s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing". Thing is that this magazine doesn't exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to get close to the actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them stupid and insult their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, also writes a leaf (which is genuine) that is mainly related to her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a truly lovable (or incredible) character, depending on how you see her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character I liked best. Brent is a flat character with not much for him, like Tedra, the music video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Nevertheless, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this film questioned all the motivations people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie, and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house audience. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
