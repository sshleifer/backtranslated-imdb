First of all, I just want to say this movie rawked more than any of the latest crap that Hollywood has cooked out of its gut. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of a late 80's / 90's action movie .... the random free acts of violence (ie, when Walken and the crew advocate confronting the drug dealers for money, they just show up and kill them Instead of letting them live and just taking their money, dirty throats, the guys on fire, the boys being blown by buildings, and of course the guys on fire are blown up by buildings. Walken is at his best in this picture, providing memorable lines like, "Let's go sitting .......... out on the deck." and others who make this movie a top buy of the clearence rack at the local video store. If you have blood clots for unnecessary acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
