Out of the first five episodes of Hammer's short-running "Hammer House of Horror" series, this fifth episode of the wonderful title "The House that Bled to Death" is undoubtedly the fate. As a great fan of Hammer Studios' gothic horror movies for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally begin to see the series quite recently. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is not yet, but even though the series remains as entertaining as the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes were amazing looking at their morbid and brilliantly dark sense of humor, this fifth recording is definitely one of the first five to deliver the most real horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife out of unknown motivations. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move to the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Soon after moving in, however, the family has to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which apparently is haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his mediocre past entry "Growth Pain" (Episode 4) and the pretty unknown actors deliver good performances. The film is also suitable for effects, movies and scores. "The House That Bled to Death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a Short Horror story. The movie delivers an eerie atmosphere, real scary moments and intelligent twists, and is exciting and very entertaining from the beginning to the end. Overall, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
