I was a big fan of the series as a child, and after that it has always been in my heart as one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois l 'Homme ..., most of whom love me). I find out that other similar Japanese comics of this kind released later cannot match Mazinger Z as they began to dull the same pattern. This very thing, the news, can be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is its ingenuity, with so many extravagant monsters, strange units and bizarre characters; In fact, we were eager to see every new installment to find out what kind of new enemy or evil machine was waiting for us!
