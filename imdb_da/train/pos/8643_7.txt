This was a scary movie. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt deserved an Oscar for this. <br /> <br /> A travel writer (played by David Duchovny from X-Files fame) and his girlfriend pick up two hitch hikers (Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt) heading for California. <br /> <br /> On their way they stop at infamous serial killer scenes for shooting scenes for a forthcoming book Duchovyne's character works on, only they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the country's history is sitting right next to them in the same car.
