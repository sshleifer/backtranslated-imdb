What can I say that has not been said about "The Haunting"? It has everything that would make a good picture. Amazing sets, moody music and sound design to die for were all in place. The play sometimes kicks the mind in such a strange, surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it through, perhaps because they were too busy creating CG effects and building Gothic sets to see how weak the plot was. Each member of the casting gives a dignified performance even if it is not convinced of the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others respond most to her. But it's about it. All I can say is that it was a little enjoyable two hours, but you will definitely have more. Much more.
