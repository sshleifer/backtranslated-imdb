I saw this in the early 70's (when I was 16), and despite the long slow setup, meetings, riots, etc. When the desert began, everyone went into context and I loved it. (It does very well anyway.) Back I was in what seemed to be a small minority. All criticism seemed to concentrate on lack of action and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> It shows clearly (in a certain prophetic way) the political shattering, turmoil, confrontation, brutal oppression, commercialization, and deception that lies ahead. <br /> <br /> Assessment for this magistral film has grown and I'm happy about it.
