I have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture, I'm white and like classic rock, but it didn't stop me from appreciating this amazing comedy. It's basically a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap instead of or rock. But it's fun. There are many fun jokes, but not without some jokes that just fall flat. The characters are all very fun and credible. I just saw because it made me laugh at. 3, and any movie that can make it at least guarantees a test screening. One of the reasons this movie was so funny was that it makes fun to rap another. Rap today is worried about the wrong things and passes with noise in the studio and a little talent. This movie comes from a time when rappers deserved more credit. All in all, it is a fun movie with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are pretty much the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
