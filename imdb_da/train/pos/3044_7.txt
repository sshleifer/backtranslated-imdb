For anyone who may not know what an actor movie was, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense. It's full of clumsy situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you're called! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. Everyone turns in a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, About Prakash, Smith's Patil ... But it's the Megastar who overshadows everyone with its high presence. Without him this film would have been a non-starter ... The story is about separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs. evil - all really! Amitabh is a brilliant performance on all counts, in an otherwise stupid movie! And have I mentioned that this is ridiculously fun?
