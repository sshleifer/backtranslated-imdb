I've seen many PPVs in the past, but this is the most entertaining, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD extras are worth it because they give a different picture of how the wrestlers work after the show (such as the chris benoit interview / interviews interview), a glimpse of the Monday quarter, the first match of the Hogan winning gold title and some promotional talk. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Take Team Table match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This was a really good intense battle to start the show. Not too many teams and just plain raw physicality. Spike can keep himself in tables fighting and Guerro and Benoit gave good clean wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. The WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd didn't really care about either breaks and didn't get interested before Kidman made a star issue. Normally, people expect a lot of flying in a cruise weight championship, but it had very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, no one was caring or knowing (you can tell by the missing camera's flashing). The finish was fast though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE EM: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I have never really looked like a wrestler, he lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but didn't really get the chance to show his high flying action, even though he still did some good counters and added that a fast pace was needed for the match. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 Looking back at Cena's very first PPV, how he used to act, how he used to dress and how he used to look (see his interview, it's pretty funny). This was a good intense match with Cena, which showed a nice selection of possessions, suplexes, counters and some antenna. Jericho was sub-couple but definitely helped Cena launch his career. Cena Wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontentital Championship: RVD by Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both wrestler styles really matched well on the screen, with Brock's clean power and raw energy vs. RVD's full movement and speed skills. RVD looked good in this match (better than his later games with edge and cena) and the whole match was fast paced. The end worked perfectly because it still retained Brock's undefeated strip while giving RVD his only desserts in his homeland. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked some intensity as the RVD match, but still a good follow-up. Although it started off a bit slowly (which it always has a big show), Booker T was impressive and made a sick move on the advertising table. The finisher was great, the end was a great uprising and great move up for Booker T. <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre fight. Hogan comes as usual to a large pop, but his diversity of movements lacks that intensity and energy. Then, Christians do not have the greatest athletic skills themselves. This ended up being a mediocre match at best, but was still OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for the Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily this year's game. This is by far the best triple threat match I've ever seen. It had close falls, lots of finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity, and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of this. If you want to buy this DVD, I would buy it strictly for this match. (ends? See for yourself!) <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a solid PPV with lots of extra goodies to keep you going again and again. Although it's hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it's definitely worth your money.
