Have you heard the story of the restrained heroes who were hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, you got it? Was it set in a world made up of small islands floating over clouds, and did heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to the next on their journey? Won the water upwards and the remains of the big cities levitating on the horizon? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> I accidentally stumble upon this movie and I'm really glad I did! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like the Pixar films, it is a piece of computer animated art that could only be done in today's world. The animators have invested the idea of ​​almost everything that appears on the screen and this attention to detail is staggering (the scene where mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke while the characters go rude in the background is one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to see in action. Although the plot may not be unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you are watching. Our main characters are sympathetic and interesting, so the audience stands behind their almost impossible pursuit of reaching the end of the world and destroying the dragon, which otherwise can devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character that most will fall in love with. A little blue creature with a crazy laugh and a tendency to speak a mix of nonsense and English, Hector delivers comedy help in a way Jar Jar Binks could only dream of . <br /> <br /> In summary, I recommend seeing Dragon Hunters if you get the opportunity. Watch it for the incredible animation, the breathtaking battle scenes and an insight into a world unlike anything else you've seen on a movie theater or TV screen. At least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - whether you're nine or nine (which is actually me)!
