You wait to see if remake is better or worse. I rated the Audie Murphy movie a 3 (I'm a hard bark), the second lowest I've ever given to Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a tough one). It is the civil war history of apostate "soldiers" if you want to call them north. People like Quantrell, and the men who rode with these bans. <br /> <br /> The original was an aqueous version, very clean cut, while still portraying horror of what these men did. In fact, movies like the older version are best seen by mature audiences that can distinguish the story. I would be more inclined to judge the original "R" and this one with the gruesome nature, a doctor, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message easier to decipher of a juvenile than the older version. <Br /> <br /> Movie makers since the early sixties boasted of "Realism" but few of them deliver. Instead, they just provide killing scenes, killing costumes and killing events, but with cartoon-cardboard stereotypical signs, the weakness of the spaghetti era. Modern film makers have realized this mistake. It is evident in a superior style of western we are usually seen today. This movie is an example. It provides the realistic settings, but also gives us characters that we can believe exist in that time. <br /> <br /> It has some lulls that make a complete sit through a bit tough and it has some inexplicable situations. But inexplicable situations are okay as long as the whole movie stops and the characters are exciting enough. It starts a bit campy, but really improves. The protagonist is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. The Audie Murphy character from the early film really does not produce any sympathy and is too self-righteous without motivation. The character of this film follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is motivation and a method for his madness. We never feel that he really is "right", but we can understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of action in the movie. There is also some humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that she would not lie to him and he mumbles it over. <br /> <br /> This movie succeeds in doing what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and author team got it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
