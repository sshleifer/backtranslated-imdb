Normally I don't really like Emma Roberts so much, but after seeing Nancy Drew it changed me something. The actors in the movies made it all exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you see a mysterious movie, you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you're actually there. The guides must all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed at how she found out. The whole movie was really clever, and the people who saw it with me also loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I give it a nine because the popular girls do not really seem to have the right part, but they make me laugh. It was a great movie and a fantastic mystery. I definitely recommend seeing it.
