I loved this movie. It's a certain inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth renting or worth buying. It should be in everyone's home. Best movie I've seen for a long time. It will make you angry because everyone is so bad at Carl Brashear, but eventually it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of fun lines to keep you tuned. I love many quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on the job with what I want to do. It shows that everyone can reach their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I see it, I never notice it's as long as it is. I get so engrossed in it that it goes so fast. I love this movie. I see it when I can.
