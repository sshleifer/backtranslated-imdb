I went into this movie after reading it was a drama of a man with a supernatural gift made for a monster of society. Suffice it to say that I expected something completely different from what I got. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought that the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male leader is not bad at seeing for sure) and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them until 3. One part of the movie for now each other's name had the whole movietheater laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. So in short: Not what I expected, but a really good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
