Pushing Daisies is just a lovely adventure with shades of "Amelie" aesthetic and romance. It has a beautiful palette, its images well thought out and detailed, its names and dialogue moody and for cutesy to be genuine, its imagination great and its romance deep. See the blue in the sky pop out on you, as blue cannot be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions). See a strange natural and completely satisfying song breaking out of a scene. <br /> <br /> Its score is beautiful, its cast is extremely sympathetic, there is good music, and the two leading romantic stars cannot touch or she will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (In fact, I had wished they found a way around this, but it was just a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. Would like to see more. It got me through a flu a crazy week, as it gives a good company. <br /> <br /> Take it back!
