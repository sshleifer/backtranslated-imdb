This movie has literally every action movie clich√© and everyone works to their advantage. From deadly weapons Gary Busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this movie with such ruthless surrender, it can't help entertaining and entertaining. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice vans and if they aren't good enough to see this movie then what about the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is then you probably won't like this movie.
