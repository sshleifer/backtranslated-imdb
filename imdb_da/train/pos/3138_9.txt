Yes, I did when I sat here red and remembered having felt almost guilty when I saw it a few weeks back while my wife chose to see something as incorrect (in comparison) as "Mommie Dearest." <br /> <br /> How to explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin" - I mean the only ones who have ever rained, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a horrible show with horrible plots and terrible plays - and oh yes it was terribly fun! And the same goes for this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile is sold to charity. But it is stolen and our friends (like themselves) jump into the personas of their old people (if not their costumes) and go out to find out what has happened. Along the way, they are reminiscent of the series and we see how it all came together in flashbacks, where Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden play the young Adam and Burt in the television series. It was really interesting to get some behind the scenes to look at the old series, and Adam and Burt just went all the way back to the character (although they were not really in character - yes, you should see it to see what I mean. ) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will hate this. If - heaven forbids - you actually thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable "Batmans" then you would hate this even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still willing to admit you've never missed an episode - yes, that's for you. Yes, it's true - 9/10
