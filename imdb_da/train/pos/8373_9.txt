Note to previous reviewer: This movie is "Iliad's science-fiction custom" by writer. So if the references are painful or not, no excuses, it is the basis of the film. They admit that they stole ... although it is customized, P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Fantastic flick but too short. Probably did not come out as well as the writer, instructor or studio wanted but pretty amazing fun. The fact that the studio itself imploded during the production only helps to add to its heritage. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake would not be so fun and probably wouldn't make the script more fair. But it is fun to dream of the potential there. A DVD release with some bad extras is apparently available, but I don't think it would play on NTSC players. I'm no expert and still try to figure it out. For now I live with the VHS incarnation.
