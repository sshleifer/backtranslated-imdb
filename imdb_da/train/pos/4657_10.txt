Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun, eerie story with amazing performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the company. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as usual, and Maggie Smith --- certainly one of the greatest actresses all the time --- is a total joy. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round out the throw and are also perfect. If you want a movie that has perfect casting then it is. What is so impressive is how these people work from each other in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments all the way through. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor, and this is one of his most memorable performances. The direction, photography and editing are also top notch, and it's a great time capsule of London in the 60s. It's definitely on my all-time favorites list.
