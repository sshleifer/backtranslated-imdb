Without being one of my favorites, this is good for a pace change ... even if it's only a few minutes. It all starts with a big battle between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is renamed "Butch" here). They all beat, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests that they all be friends. So everyone signs a peace agreement and becomes friends ... who will not last a long time. In the meantime, the three become loving, patient and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life. The relationship only goes well until a very large steak appears and they are all greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual fighting and rivalry. But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a lovely and grateful experience, even if only for a while. <br /> <br /> By the way, as a curious fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental versions: "We are unable to see the guide" and "Somewhere over rainbow ".
