"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not become better critics, it is fun, harmless and sweet. I first looked at it when I was 11, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later I got it on VHS: -P Until today I have shown it to many friends and they liked it all, but no one knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost no one knows, so almost no one likes it ... This movie never got a real chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential for a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Spaceballs". Okay, enough dissatisfaction - What I really wanted to say is if you ever want to laugh at your head, see it! Even if you don't get angry about it, it's worth seeing! -> Prepare to laugh, earthly!
