This movie is one of the finest 90's American B movies. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an action, a lot of laughs and a heavy in cheek variation on the police fighting with gangsters, it's worth seeing. Everyone thinks the landscape a bit, but that's really what the movie is about and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to make another movie together.
