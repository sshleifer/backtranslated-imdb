Now I gave this movie a 7. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "In the Beginning" as far as the B5 movies go. I really think the TV series did a much better job in general with the special effects and character portrait. Let's hope manufacturers and cast get the next series "Crusade" up to the B5 standards.
