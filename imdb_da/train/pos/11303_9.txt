Visconti's first film has all its trademarks visual flair and immaculate technique, accompanied by convincing performances by Massimo Girotti as the beautiful drives and best of all, Clara Calamai as the stunning, hectic Giovanna. Remade several times as 'The Postman Rings Twice' but never better. Can't believe it was man's first movie! It shows confidence in someone in their career.
