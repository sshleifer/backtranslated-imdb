In the long run, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bear movie. Well last summer I saw them both together and decided that I was wrong. The first is a better Care Bears movie (which you might have guessed if you read my review for it). This is not a bad movie, it's just ... IMPORTANT. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, as a few people have mentioned, it completely condemns any knowledge of the first film. I can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the gender of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and looked at this, I was a little confused and distraught. I felt the same way to see it as an adult! <br /> <br /> Because of why the movie is actually pretty good (if you separate it from the first movie). I can't think of another movie for young children with a DEMON as it's the villa! Now I'm not in a moment to suggest that evil demons who want to steal campers and Care Bear's souls are good, I just find it cold that there is a BIG WOMAN in a movie for little kids! It's such a bizzare "Santa Clause vs. Satan" movie from Mexico you hear about sometimes. <br /> <br /> In any case, the demon's name is Darkheart, and he wants this chick to help him get Care Bears in return for giving her special powers. Very dark for a kiddy girl eh? And I mention that Darkheart often seems to be the girl as a WHINEY VOICED 10 YEARS OLD BOY ??? Freaky! Meanwhile, some other children in Care-a-Lot looking for BABY CARE BEARS! Oh man! Demons and Baby Care Bears in the same movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything will be cleared eventually (but not until we see Darkheart trap Care Bears' souls in this scary chandelier thing in a [surprising] deeply disturbing scene). But I'm back with the question of whether this movie has found the cult audience it deserves right. I can only see it again myself.
