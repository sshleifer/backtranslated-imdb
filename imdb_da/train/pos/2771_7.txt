David and Bathsba are a sumptuous Hollywood biblical image produced by 20th-century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore ( Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second Old Testament book of Samuel from the Holy Bible. It follows King David, who, as a child, had beaten the gigantic goliat, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. A hard and secure king, however, David has problems with the heart that cause major problems. For once he spies Bathsheba in the bath; it is the start of a journey that includes adultery and fraud; a journey that will end in the judgment of God being called upon. <br /> <br /> Typical of the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great, generous production. From its superb set of designs to the positively beautiful Technicolor photography {Leon Shamroy}, it has enough quality to justify sitting alongside the best genre has to offer in terms of production values. Untypically, tho, the film is paced and trusts that 99% of its worth is driven exclusively by dialogue. This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic image that cannot actually wrap around the burning bush here, it is a biblical love story intertwined with the sins of the heart. But it is not bad at all, because we break it down, we find it very well acted. {Peck has a stoic, but vulnerable thing goes really well, and Hayward pushes it to the maximum}, and it's a fine story aimed at knowing the skill of the often-forgotten Henry King. And although part of the dialogue is cringe inducing, the character stream is never interrupted as Phillip Dunnes (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) Oscar nominated manuscript keeps the attention all the time. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical / sword & sandals genres (probably because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point), but it's really worth the time for anyone interested in the most lavish genres. 10.7
