I caught this movie late on a Saturday / Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the best movies to separate from what I've ever seen. From "luxury" ocean liner is actually a "roll on, roll off" ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with sticky stickers saying staff and then see the same door used for something else in another scene - this movie clips !! The continuity is so bad you can't help but notice it, it hits you with the holes. In the final scene, he jumps out of a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new boyfriend (The ship's PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police, but was dismissed for doing things his way - true) on the ferry goes very quickly away from the explosion. ...... so Dad is there hugging them. How???? Who cares, its magic. There is no redemption feature for this movie. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. When you are chased by the bad guys, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who instead of checking under the table One continue to shoot up four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - amazing). They go right past the only hiding place so our Casper can get around and take them out. Get some friends, get a few drinks in, put the film on and howl.
