I enjoy all versions of this story, but this is my very first favorite. George C.Scott gives a depth to the Scrooge character that the others do not give. The film shows more about why he gets so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he meets the various ghosts and the events they show him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim by far. He is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He does not play the role of dignity, not even as a wimpy man who wars under Scrooges'thumb, but as a man who elegantly sets it up because he has a family to care for. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen. Most often, he is played as a jolly Santa character. In this, he shows anger at Scroge's attitudes and really gets Scrooge to reconsider. <br /> <br /> Costumes and sets really put the time of London or Dickens to life. A wonderful movie.
