As most of you can see Seen Star Wars: Return Off The Jedi you can know it's a good movie but you could have watched video The M | may have a party at the end, and they probably just end the movie with the party with no spirits or anything But on the original (Live TV) when they party But before I say more when Ben obi-wan dies in imperial ship or death star , they saw him disappear and Yoda dies from either old age or inner illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (Real Name: Anakin Skywalker) when they all parties at the end when Luke or someone stops the spirits from Ben and Yoda racks there staring at him and smiling while another spirit emerges, its Darth Vader, but not as a Sith as the old unusual self of him and started smiling with legs and yoda I reckon It made the movie end up a bit interesting But the producer or someone should have done a spirit of Padme And Mace Windu And Other Jedis Killed With Younglings Under There Weapons In The Back Of The Ground
