Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was pure shine. Cassidy personalized arrogance, confidence, charm and joke - all with a discouraging, evil little smirk on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (has appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down. A fresh face Steven Spielberg did a fantastic camera work (yes, there were a few camera shadows on the actors at times) that capture nuances and scratches at different and exciting angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also the panorama and tight shoots in Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin home) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this episode yet, you owe it to yourself - it's a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, aged 49 was very sad and in fact very tragic - he probably had his best years ahead of him. Rest in Fred Jack, you will live for eternity through your great work.
