Bug's life is a good movie. But for me it doesn't really compare with movies like Toy story and things. Don't make me wrong, I liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as Toy history. The film has the pictures, the laughs and others that the Toy story had. But the film didn't feel like ... I don't know, but I thought it was still a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Life of a bug ... I don't want to say this is a movie I can't remember. I saw it many years ago. Of course I haven't seen Toy history this year, but I still remember it. I shouldn't have gone through this movie, but I am. I give it a thumbs up, even though it's not just the best work Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> Life of a bug: *** / ****
