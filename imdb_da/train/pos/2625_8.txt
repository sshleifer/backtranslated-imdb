Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's straight to video throw away followers. Like the previous successor (The Lion King 2), I was happy that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors, making a big difference and keeping a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders around for a while, but we are distracted by an infinite number of jokes ranging from hilarious to boring. To break into the free plot and jokes, they gave us some stupid musical sequences, much like the jokes ranging from entertaining to a quick ride to the fridge. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and do not add much more to the movie than to act as a vehicle for one hour of feedback. The new characters are at least sympathetic, and the old signs are out doing their thing so I can't fault them there. Overall, this movie is not bad, and it provides a nice, frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.
