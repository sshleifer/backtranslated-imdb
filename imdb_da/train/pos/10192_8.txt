This is the one that is most powerful. Although before the championship Who is Next, which would give anthems as Baba O'reily and will not be fooled again. This film shows the group in transition from against rockers to one of the biggest live bands in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what a front man's about, Entwistle stable as ever. <br /> <br /> Moon is great, watch the ongoing conversation with drum technology and watch him play "side saddle" while replacing a bass drum head! <br /> <br /> Townsend even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally! <br /> <br /> Given that they went to the stage at 2am, nobody was in the crowd asleep! <br /> <br /> There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is hard to imagine that any of the bands today produce a concert that lasts 36 years will be enjoyed as much as this one.
