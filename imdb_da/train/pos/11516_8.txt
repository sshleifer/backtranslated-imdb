I'm not John Cleese completist (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this meeting, I neglected a shelf at my local Blockbuster that I tried. What I got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences I've ever had, the script is typically English "goon show" schtick, in fact, as a soundtrack, it wouldn't be in place at a "Firesign Theater" album. The performance and timing is spot on, and this raises the "Strange Case" into the kind of staggering performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics. <br /> <br /> The British have a gift to combine broad satirical lampons with carefully observed "tics" of character and timing, and the creators both use to a good effect here. Cleese's portrayal of "Holmes" seems to blame much for Arkin and Seller's "Inspector Clouseau", but Cleese has such a physical comedy ability that he more than keep their own n the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "watson" as a brilliant but unbeatable unlimited imbecile with such excellent timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the movie. I had never heard of Lowe before this (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not care for "Strange Case ...", especially if British whim is not their "cuppa tea". But I am very glad that I got to see this before it disappeared from sight.
