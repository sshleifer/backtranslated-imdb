I saw this movie earlier today and I was amazed at how accurate the dialogue is to the protagonists. It didn't feel like a movie - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The leading ladies in this movie seemed just as right to me as any fifteen year old girl I know. All in all, a very enjoyable movie for those who enjoy independent movies.
