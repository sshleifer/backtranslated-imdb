Kubrick showed his ingenuity again, now in a thrill movie based on Stephen King's book of the same name. Jack Torrance is a man in his four series, married to a child and having a past with problems and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends the service in the winter due to the extreme weather and there is a well-paid job for the person taking care of the facilities during the five months; And Torrance, who sought to become an author, found it perfect. But the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness of this place in the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker had previously become insane and murdered his family. Even before they arrived, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend who illuminates the future (shining), knew that the place was not good and didn't want to go. When they installed themselves at the hotel, things started right, but within a month, Jack began to act strange, annoyed, and depressed. At this point we know something that needs to happen, but do not know when and how. Frightening things happen as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and one who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good to them as if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "uninvited" at the hotel. Following this order Jack went for the goal, and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here. The end is spectacular and viewers will remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
