Some genre films must be adhered. This one was an exception. Taken on its own merits, it is a dressed up version of the horror genre film. With minimal special effects it manages to be a psychological examination of varieties, with a simple but existential theme - who gets hit by the bus and why her? It's not a good movie, but because it's not a little familiar with it, the story works. Subtle, and all about the interactions between the characters. In fact, there is a contrivance in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there just to set the tone for what is to come. I appreciate the balance between male and female energy and will not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people who respond to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some empathy, appreciate the need for a little adventure in your life and wonder "What would I do in this situation?"
