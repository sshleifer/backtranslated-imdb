Clark Gable plays a con man who breaks into the hard-boiled lady Jean Harlow's life. He tries to suck her while she brushes him with her hard crazy attitude. Despite their cynicism and disadvantages, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man, he runs out and leaves loyal Harlow to the woman's prison, where she discovers she is pregnant. Anita Loos 'and Howard Emmett Rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many fun and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman objection and a black women's prison, and her preaching father hardly played any traces of stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their mettle as actors, adding to the nuances and quirks of their characters that send them beyond the typical Gable and Harlow roles. And the direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. A beautiful shot has Harlow embarked in the prison and is then led into a surprisingly snowy yard, which the camera tracks for her. This is one of the best of both "criminals in love" and "women's prison" genres and has some of the best cooked dialogues ever written.
