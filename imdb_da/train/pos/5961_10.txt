I can be biased, I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The play is written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character Marlon in the film. I couldn't be more pleased with the trailer, I hope to see the movie in its entirety and I will comment further. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. She wears most of the emotional vehicles in fine shape. I couldn't have done better myself! This resembles real people, hardly formally driven and fortunately my statement on racial prejudice drives home gracefully and fervently.
