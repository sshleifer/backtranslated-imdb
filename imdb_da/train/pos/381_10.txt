I did not give this movie 10 because it is a fantastic consistent movie, but it is the sheer ability to evoke feelings in the audience. The story of one-woman-match-against-odds is an old clich√© now, but very few films have carried it with so much warmth and sincerity as The Purple Purple. It also showed another side for the African American experience - showing that after slaves were given freedom, many fell into the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portrait-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. <br /> <br /> Also the performances are amazing - especially Oprah, whom I now have a new respect for. <br /> <br /> Worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.
