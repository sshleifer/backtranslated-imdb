I show this film to college students in voice and media law because its lessons are timeless: Why speak out for injustice is important and can create the search queries that are being sought. Why press freedom and freedom of speech are crucial to democracy. This is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through Steven Biko's activism and Donald Wood's journalism. It also provides an important lesson on freedom of speech: "You can blow a light, but you cannot extinguish a fire. When the flame begins to catch, the wind will blow it higher." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, to shake the tree).
