Impressive, ugly, unpleasant retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard determined to find (and destroy!) You killed by the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent inconsistency behind the dramatic structure of the movie. Scott is also unaware or indifferent to 30 years of social progress. I really don't think we'll see a more violent movie any time soon, so you better go see it here while you can. In spite of the relentless ugliness, I think the film is a powerful example of cinema in its most eerie, exploitative and effective way. Scott has a hard thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this movie are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's direct election is simply astonishing, and he draws a fantastic performance out of Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I recommended it to the viewers looking for a big action movie.
