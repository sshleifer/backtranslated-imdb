Having seen Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever show such a form to imagine that he could ever come close to Mr Britt's portrayal of "one of the most interesting signs in literature". Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes, and in my opinion there can't be anyone else. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a close second, but is still second. One can argue that Mr Rathbone's screens were inferior to the absolute top notch productions available to Mr Brett, and I would agree. But when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and always be the only actor to truly become "Sherlock Holmes". The book should be closed on this subject and we, the public, left to enjoy Mr.Brett's unique performances. Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
