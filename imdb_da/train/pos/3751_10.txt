I know you have already entered this in film festivals (or at least I think you have, I just have to do it up), but I think this should get "best animated short films" in every one. Bravo. I can't wait for the full movie. I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre character of your animations, but listen to it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Even though I still mean it. And here is another one-SOHO! - and I can't stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and yet I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably see all of your movies in yet another staple "Jason Steele Marathon". I have many of them. <br /> <br /> -R
