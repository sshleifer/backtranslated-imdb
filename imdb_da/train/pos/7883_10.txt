I watched this movie with my friend and we couldn't stop laughing! I think there was nothing scary about this movie! It was fun all the lines Freddy said were fun! I think they haven't even made a new nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. Jason. Although some parts were brutal (like the head jumping up). and any elm street movie from 1-5 sucked. this was the best beyond number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to rent this and you will laugh a lot. I'd like to see the Texas chainsaw massacre I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead The final nightmare overall character: B-
