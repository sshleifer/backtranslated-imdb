GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, stylish and stylish action image with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking cars. If you are interested in cars, this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") is worth seeing just to attach your eyes to the shiny vehicles. Although the film secures weakness in many areas, the precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer experience. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young villain named Kip Raines, who, as the film opens, does not provide a long list of expensive cars for the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) . When Kip's life is threatened by such, his older brother Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skilled car thief, is required to perform a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel twenty-five cars specified by model color , year and make-in only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis pays out the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull his heel out. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but gruff retired car developer who knows Memphis through past business, a guy called Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Contributing to the movie's drives and tensions is a sub-plot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) who suspect from past experience that Memphis and his crew are completely without good and keep an eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; The audience learns to know these people, even though their robust lifestyle and harsh personalities through the hard core, stylish atmosphere of the movie. To make matters worse for the movie, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a sharp cultural tone. I'm not saying that I think ghost and vulgarism are necessary for thrillers to flourish; In fact, I honor the director's decision to maintain extremely eerie language in a movie that could very easily have achieved an R rating. However, I believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds" to develop the character's enlightenment greatly. The dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite problems, the characters are effective because of the top notches, completely cast cast performers. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and compelling. Angelina Joly's sleazy look is perfectly appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is lovely and trustworthy. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide compelling supportive roles. <br /> <br /> The film features standard structure with a satisfying first action that deepens the style of history and the character's motives, sets a fast pace of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act, we run into a few problems: history wastes time under much of this segment, and never builds on the third act. While the middle of the movie takes a lot of time and a sex scene gives a solid mid-plot, not much happens. The third act is basically a pure adrenaline rate that contains furious wall-to-wall tension and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The "Gone in 60 Seconds" soundtrack contributes to a great deal of inspiring action scenes. These are scenes like the car gates that make this movie work in spite of several devastating errors. Dominic Sena, whose career mainly consists of managing advertising, has an appealing style and decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will give the audience two hours of rebellion, excitement and excitement, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br />
