National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's that combines unique characters, lots of fun and good music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is completely humiliated by his classmates at their high school, he takes the chance to take revenge on his classroom. One by one, he closes his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, high school beauty, king of all preachers, and even the ugly old lunatic who served up all the kids during high school. This movie has some kind of scary element in it and it has some short scenes of sexuality so I don't recommend it to young children, but it's a great movie for teens. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or kills special effects, you may not love Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some good laughs and a lot of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
