Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of bad writing and action on parts. I think the good over wins the bad. <br /> <br /> I love origami parts and the big "twist" in the end. I absolutely love the scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes in season 1. <br /> For some reason people have always hated the Reincarnation episodes, but I've always wanted them. They are not the best in writing. but the theme really interests me, <br /> <br /> I will give it a three star, but if the writing was a little more consistent, I would give it four.
