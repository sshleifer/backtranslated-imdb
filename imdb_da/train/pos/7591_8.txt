A mess of genres, but it is mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There are magical kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some pristine melodrama for a topping. Production is excellent and pacing is fast, so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this movie. A baby is left beside a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery, in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man has somehow but cannot read. The old monk teaches the boy, but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a false Kung Fu master who is assisted by four crazy monks. The new master gets angry with the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak stroke and throws him out for the night. The boy is found to throw trash in a basket from an incredible distance by a man who brings him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great battle, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to make the boy a college basketball sensation. All this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of what happens in the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extreme shorthand story, the first problem is how little we learn to know the protagonist so far into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined by the time the first third is over. The reason does not follow any new reason except the movie's insane action climate. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the bad monks will show up towards the end. The effects, photography and stuntwork are all top class and fit the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better plot of plot and comedy writing, and this movie will live in its shadow, but it's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending. Recommended.
