Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to talk about, the movie turned out much better than you would expect, certainly much more true to Peter O'Donnell's books and comics than the two previous films. You can read the strip currently in reprint from Titan Books, or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the greatest adventure cartoons of all time. The movie is not great, but unlike most low budget films, it gets the most out of what it has and it has your interest. On the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is naturally stoned, is a gas. Some people have rebuffed Tarentino for linking his name to the movie, but without him it would never have happened. He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
