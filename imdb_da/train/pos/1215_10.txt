This is my favorite of the three care bears movies. Once again I liked all the songs. The big problem, however, is that most have pointed out that this story is contrary to the original. For those who saw the first movie, the bear remembered their "cousins" that they apparently never knew about. Of course, it was not at last that the cousins ​​got their stomach symbols after having proven how much they used to do. In this story, cousins ​​grow with caregivers and have stomach symbols all the time. That said, it's not a bad movie as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I thought the Darkheart character was much more evil when Nicholas of the first. But at the same time, I felt it added some kind of balance to the sweetness of the caregivers. I also liked the careful part at the end, although I know that other people had mixed feelings about that scene. And of course I loved the songs. My favorites grow up and forever young. The caring carrier film has always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
