When I first saw this movie in the 1980s, I was in the middle of teens and somewhat reluctant to see this when I considered myself the adult and out of the "Sesam Street / Muppets" age. I honestly can't remember if I liked it at that time or not. But somewhere in college I looked at this movie again and it ceased to go (and stay) in my personal Best Films Ever collection. <br /> <br /> This movie is LOADED with humor that goes far beyond what would have expected from Muppets. I mean, of course, Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because there is humor aimed at both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally told to tell someone "I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there's a joke from a son's father that if the son is in love with Kermit Miss will father not hear it ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth to mouth resuscitation (sp?) And subsequently says "I think we are engaged now" ... these and many other moments in the movie had me rolling. Add to the very smart dialogue, very clever New York / Broadway "blink blink" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really fun songs that do not border on "kid level cheesy" at all ... this movie is a masterpiece ! I don't throw "10" out regularly ... but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film keeps up, maybe even more. The Muppets were never and will never be again, as fun and smart and clearly brilliant as this movie was and is. --- Q
