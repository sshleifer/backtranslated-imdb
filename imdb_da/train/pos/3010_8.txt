William Powell's last outing as Philo Vance arises in The Kennel Murder Case, where the murder of a championship dog leads to two murders and an attempt on the human kind. It's all about finding out how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> SS Van Dine's Phil Van Vance murders were most popular at the time, and the wise Mr Van Dine was a way of selling his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder. That's why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studies that put them out. Had Bill Powell not been more famous with MGM as the Nick Charles of the Thin Man series, he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same competition where the murdered dog was entered, and then another rival owned the first murder victim. As usual, Powell Eugene Palette, as Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to the procedure was to use his mass to break down the locked door from the door, found the first murder victim. <br /> <br /> I said you were locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was finding out how. Powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as it usually is in a Thin Man mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, fill their cast roles. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually remade it in the thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only excursion like Philo Vance. It does not hold a candle to it. Since this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD, you need to see this or acquire it if you can.
