I first saw this movie when I was about seven years old and was totally enchanted by it, but for years I couldn't figure out what the movie was called. now i am twenty-one and stumbled upon the movie accidentally about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the movie was a little unclear, I was by no means disappointed with what I saw. The animation in this movie is great to evoke a whole world that is so credible and so animated that you are drawn into the movie alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain both adults and children. With a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate mother and a well-built love story, this movie won't let you down. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
