We don't have to lose this movie, it's one of the greatest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we just have these black and white pictures to remember one of the biggest and most underrated French directors. You just love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> Ps: Sorry for English ...
