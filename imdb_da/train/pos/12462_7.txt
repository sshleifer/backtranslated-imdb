Noni Hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance (which won her an AFI prize) is at least on par with her efforts in FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner looks like Noni's child, and Michael Caton (known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting, Hazlehurst is currently hosting the lifestyle program Better Homes and Gardens, and Caton hosts property type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc ...) This film confirms the popularly convinced belief that Noni was undoubtedly Australia's best female actor in the early to mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
