This is a very good underestimated act / drama / and a little historical film. <br /> <br /> The basic story relates to Rob Roy's 1,000-pound loan, theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a wonderful villain and character in this story. Brutally cold, and if you see his face, he seems to be able to extinguish and look completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the authors used the word "honor" 1 too many times. The rest of the molding is strong and the whole film is very suitable and busy. The action is exciting and the swordplay is very realistic, but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All in all just shy of a classic.
