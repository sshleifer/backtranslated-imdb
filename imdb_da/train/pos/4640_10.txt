It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premiere in Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war has begun ...) This problem in the communication between the people, that causes wars, is interesting to me for a long time, and it does not matter how boys and girls, straight and gay, Jews and Arabs ... I have seen the bubble already 3 times and it is still surprising and exciting to me - each character reminds me of one of the many people I know and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... Last time I saw it - was with my friend who is a Christian Arab, and that was on Israel's Independence Day (the most symbolic I could! how ironic) and ... he cried last !!! - if he has been touched and was not embarrassed at all - everyone would be touched by The Bubble!
