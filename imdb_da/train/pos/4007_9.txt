A tremendously shocking, intelligent work by the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (this is the best thing he has done since then). It's about intelligent people whose lives don't give up much. They have wasted what they have been given and are largely empty ships. The only sign on the screen that lives is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside until a rough craftsman shows her a love and awakens her to the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with a lot of compassion. This is a movie where people and places feel confident, where characters exist beyond the screen. In some respects, it's a bit like "Sunday, bloody Sunday," but it's a harder job. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. And it's beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> As the lonely mother Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in her extraordinarily built-in performance, and the very fine actor Daniel Craig shows shadows to his character than even Kureishi has not dropped. If the movie hits a false note, it may be in the character of the talented daughter caught up in a messy affair with the man the mother seduces (or should it be reversed) and even more amusing, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she chops you anyway. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and will undoubtedly be the best British film of the year.
