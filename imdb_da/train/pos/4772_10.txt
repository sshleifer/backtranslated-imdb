This movie is perhaps the most touching and uplifting one I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. Suddenly one discovers that there really is meaning for life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded and I was afraid the story would be banal. But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a ride. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema's feeling that I had really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he had to make a movie after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep feelings and in-depth human insight because I also believed he succeeded very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted instructors around, and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5 / 10
