But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story, there is a lock to make you cry. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, a physician and working very long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work plan, Dominick alone is much of the time and tends to pose questionable convictions. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in the church to pray at some point and expresses his feelings so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damned movie even really gets started. <br /> <br /> Not giving away anything here, but the movie is extremely involved and sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a market with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a good song, I cannot quote here, it has nothing to do with the movie at all, but it is oddly appropriate .. but you hear it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie when he was for 'Amadeus', I expected to give him the inside track to win. No such luck. Liotta is just as good, but has less emotional consequences, but then he does later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have a big part here, but it was nice of her to borrow her name for a little drama in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
