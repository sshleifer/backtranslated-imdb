This movie is an interesting utilization of the killer scarecrow genre - it manages to rise to become larger than the sum of its parts. Average montage scenes, 30-somethings play teens, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new wave" of modern classics. As a viewer, I got away from the movie with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when I first saw the Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's scary portrayal of the moral bankruptcy Judy deserved his Grammy nomination, which was well documented stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the successors could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the Godfather series, which improved with each installment and culminated in 2012 with the Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
