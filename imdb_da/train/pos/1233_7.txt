A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take on the height of his career. While there is much of the "Eddie Murphy character", he plays a really decent person. The rest of the casting is good, especially the lovely Charlotte Lewis. Her character's beauty and serenity kept the tone of the movie from becoming too much Murphy.
