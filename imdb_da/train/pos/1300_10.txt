I first saw a track from this DVD on a hifi show in November 2006 in London (I wasn't really into cream until now !!). It was through an advanced Arcam system, it sounded good with dts. I had to get this DVD and I will tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. Cream performance in their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best I've heard on a music DVD. It doesn't matter what type of music you like, this will surely grow on you. It's the sheer brilliance of their performance that makes you see it again and again. Even new musicians do not cut mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
