Sure, it can't be a classic, but it's a full of classic lines. One of the few movies, my friends and I quote from all the time, and that's fifteen years later (maybe it was on Cinemax too many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he can't seem to find out of how to play it - but he is surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this spoof. Looking for a movie to encourage you? This is it, but rent it with friends - it makes it even better.
