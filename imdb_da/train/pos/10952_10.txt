Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, fun and talented, dark and demonic. I read the second 'comment' on this show as well as message card stuff and people just didn't get it. Nothing shown on T.V. is an accident. Too much money is time and work put into the production of a T.V. show for errors. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted to be young. I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other music tracks are wonderfully bizarre. It's much like Pee-Wee's Playhouse for incorrect, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars of America from the valley. Cast is amazing. The scenarios and the action are well-functioning. I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central did not let David spade hold his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not in the cast listing on the show's website. I would love to see her stand-up. Does anyone know about her upcoming show dates or DVDs that can float out there?
