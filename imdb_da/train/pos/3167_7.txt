This is one of the films that explores cultural collapse of Eastern-born people in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving at Tokyo Time is a sad movie about the lack of contradiction to attract because of great cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the United States when the visa expires. The marriage is only expected to be temporary, ie. until Kyoto gets back on track. But Ken, who seems to be lost in any relationship, has a taste for Kyoto and is trying very hard to make things work. This despite the fact that his friend's call to dump Kyoto and get rid of all obligations to girls is bad for rock n 'roll, except to inspire some songwriting about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. Not only what she is home to and wants to return to Japan. It is sad that at last Ken believes he can love and be with everything except when he thinks he has found someone to feel that the girl is not expecting to stay that long. It's not that she doesn't like Ken, it's just that she's used to a whole lively way. She says, "I can't tell him the way I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me the way he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty boring love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack. I picked me up lovingly at Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s movies, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who love to love Tokyo Time, check out Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American coverband), except that it is a movie with a good ending . <br /> <br />
