The movie transported everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the great Filipino 'I will return' landing scene? It was on the Leyte coast where General MacArthur reaps its fame? <br /> <br /> The manager triumphed Gregory Peck in his portrayal of the great general ?? It's the crotch, set of shoulders, the intensity ?? That's what both men have had in common: intensity, total absorption, affection ?? With MacArthur it was for the military ?? With Peck it was for the challenge to act ?? An Oscar nominator for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High"? He has played everything from a seemingly homicidal amnesiac to a belligerent journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an occupied lawyer; from Biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? He has brought them all his own unique insights, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on the deck of 'The President of the Philippines.' We can hear the dialogue: "In general, I hope the water is not too deep," says the "president" "because my people will find that I cannot swim." Then comes Peck's sensuous voice: "And my people must find out that I cannot go to water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur", Peck has once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we felt MacArthur's feelings: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family ??
