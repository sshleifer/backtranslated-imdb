"Dangerous Offender" is the story of an apparently anti-social girl and how she came that way. It is based on a true story, and although I was annoyed by the one-tone depiction, yet scowling, by the title character and the hard-to-believe in her lawyer, I have to accept that life imitates art and that there Are people out there like that. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds for me, because although there is a little softening of the title character's behavior to almost the end, you are gradually being moved to sympathy for her as the film shows how she came to her current state - showing be self-destructive, rather than antisocial. <br /> <br /> Really a moving movie that will bring a lump to the throat when you think about it - it will often be. <br /> <br /> Despite its many flaws (including that it's hard to see sometimes due to body functions and suicide attempts), it's another production I'm proud to call Canadian.
