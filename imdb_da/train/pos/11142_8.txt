Just kidding. Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City, Jon Voight is the young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It doesn't take long after the Big Apple swallows him and his ambitions very and very soon. Joe is the target of both New York's colds and downsides from his street thugs. Because of his pure heart, he joins one of these fines, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and later moves into him in his wreck of opportunity and the two struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> While the Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful movie that is stylish in capturing the modern hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its obligatory dizzying Warhol party filmography and equated with ultra-urban New York City. The film ties Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, emphasizing his out-of-place position. We feel like his struggle to fit in, but also to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to his eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I can imagine that this movie must have inspired both Forest Gump with its purely hearted and outspoken character and to a large extent the Crocodile Dundee films, dealing with almost the same kind of humor - a contrast between cowboy cows and smooth New York cosmopolitans. Very convincing and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
