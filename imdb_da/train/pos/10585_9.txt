Footlight Parade is among the best of the 1930s musical comedy extravaganzas. A scary script and an all-star cast, including Jimmy Cagney, the lovely Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this movie a cut above the rest. Directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, this movie will make you laugh from ear to ear from start to finish. Busby is, of course, the undisputed champion of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" of his credit (as Dance Director). Footlight Parade is characterized by hundreds of sharply dressed corpses, a Berkeley brand. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera, and Busby was the first director to film close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shaped legs and "rear" shots is seen here strongly. The overall effect is very erotic and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical stage productions performed in cinemas to entertain the audience before the talks were shown. He is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a gold-engraving boyfriend. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, it was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's wisely crushing, lovestruck secretary. And Ruby Keeler is cute, as always. <br /> <br /> The movie climbing axes with three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood, where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative filmography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's Bottom Line: Clear and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever laid on celluloid. A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era hull.
