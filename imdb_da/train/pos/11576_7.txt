It is trying to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a roll like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really the perfect B-adventure all the time. It is actually a beautifully fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with its shortcomings, captures your interest. It must have felt like the greatest movie ever for the people who made it. Although it is made in the 90s, it does not have a modern feel. It has the same feeling that an old Errol Flynn movie had. Great adventure movie is again the big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as those old films had. This, on the other hand, has just the right feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
