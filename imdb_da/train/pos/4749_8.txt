I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little hard to do when your brother makes stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. But this movie I enjoyed, mostly because I'm used to the usual HK action movies. Most of the films like this are not looking at it for the story, see it for the mindless action. And thoughtless action is right. You will see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless balls. It is true that this film was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. That is one of the reasons why the ratings on this movie fell. Most people probably expected to see a movie that was as polished as a North American movie. But you have to remember that most HK movie budgets aren't nearly as high as a North American movie, and the style of a HK action movie is usually very different, usually requiring thread work in many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, watch this, try to ignore the duplication. <br /> <br /> My rating was an 8.
