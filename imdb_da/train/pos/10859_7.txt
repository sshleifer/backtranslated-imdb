Not to be confused with Resse Witherspoon's high school movie of the same name, this is a stylized look on Hong Kong's triad bands. Called choice because a new leader or 'president' is chosen by old traditions every two years. Two candidates stand up for the position and through the ego, bribes and pastorameters, the races are tense to say the least. Expertly aimed at introducing you to an expansive cast without always confusing the story phrases before revealing yourself in all its brutal glory. The Asian Godfather this is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence. Subtitle Volume 1 I think it is safe to say that there will be other installments as we go deeper into the dark world of the triads and all their feuding and underhanding. Whatever this is a good start and if there are no followers a great movie in itself.
