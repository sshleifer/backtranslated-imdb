Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her comical stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also highlights the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia, crashing Hollywood with the help of Haines, playing a bit in raw comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines is a wonderful team, and guest shots from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious movie bird or for anyone interested in the still maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a girl. Paul Ralli is the slim-headed man. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE is said to have used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story is parallel to the development of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille's late teens and early 20s films. Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Strange that the MGM never hit them together in a talkie. They are good together! A sweet romance and lovely spear of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but not shown.
