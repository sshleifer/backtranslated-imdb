This movie has it all. Feeling, power, love, Stephane Rideau's adorable naked beach dance ... It exposes the need for true inner fellowship and external communication in every relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay, it doesn't mean there's no useful insight to anyone in it. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexuals as well as gay and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to handle his feelings uncovers the way our society does not encourage us to act differently, and that is what creates the inconsistency between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see !!!!
