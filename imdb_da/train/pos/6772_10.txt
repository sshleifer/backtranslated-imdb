Unlike another user who said this movie sucked (and that Olivia Hussey was horrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was awesome !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is amazing in everything she is in! Yes she can be older now because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story line can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and I will fight back at anyone who disagrees! I enjoyed this movie as much as I have other Olivia Hussey movies. Olivia's "my girl" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. Not just because it is an Olivia movie, but because of its unique line of history and wonderful direction.
