I remember seeing this in the 1970s - so I recently borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With a nearly 30 year hiatus, I have come to a different conclusion. Most of the instructors interviewed in this series - some in the center of power like Traudl Junge (Hitler's Secretary), Karl Doenitz (Head of the German Navy) Anthony Eden (UK) - are far away, but their first-hand accounts will continue. Absence Generals and admirers of sergeants, Russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here. <br /> <br /> I remember the Lord Mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s) <br /> <br /> This is really a gem and I think the manufacturer of this series was the knight of Queen Elizabeth for this work - well deserved. <br /> <br /> Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy sets. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" I have given any review but I have discovered as a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with little time ...
