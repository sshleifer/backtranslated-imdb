Pendragon Pictures 'new movie "H G Wells' World of War", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been evolving for about. 5 years. A theater release was intended earlier this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The DVD was rushed to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which hits theaters on June 29th. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie with some reservations. How faithful is the adjustment? It is not entirely 100% faith in Wells' book, but 90-95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were brand new, such as Ogilvy astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed author / narrator has awkward teas with his cousin. But on the whole this film follows the book very closely - certainly much more than the classic 1953 version of George Pal. The biggest mistake is that it was of course made on a very cheap budget. Most of it appears to have been shot blue screen and composed with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the inner shots and scenes of crowded city streets. Overview of 1898 London looks like something from a video game. Numerous scenes in horse-drawn carriages were faked - I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot at "real" seem to be in open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, we managed to do a great deal. The film looks realistic artistically. The Martians and their stand are quite well done and very right for Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the heat beam. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the movie highlights, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets or better animation of the animation. The action and direction will not win any Oscars. Mostly they are competent, not bad, but not excellent. The music is also quite good, but not on par with any of the great Hollywood composers. In fact, I'm glad this didn't get a theatrical release because the budget constraint would have made it look much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would judge this in the same way as a BBC television adaptation of classical literature. <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks: Most scenes are presented with different colored filters (most red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently and seems more like a dormant job of mastering the DVD. And, of course, the author / narrator's fake mustache mutates from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Is it worth seeing? If you can see past the technical and budgetary constraints and get into history, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you have actually read the original H G Wells novel. However, if you are easily dismissed by cheap production values, you will best disclose this (unless you are a MST3K fan). However, be warned that the movie runs for 3 hours so I do not recommend seeing it all in one meeting. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of World of War (aka "INVASION") came out on DVD the same month as Spielberg's hits at the theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This was also made on a budget, but is updated to today as the Spielberg movie - but it is much better! And on top of that, Jeff Wayne makes an animated movie of his best-selling album from 1978, but it won't be out until 2007.
