I remember originally watching this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn't really understand the humor then, but this movie can make me laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved Oscar for this movie. His performance is amazing - considering he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are top notch. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when you speak to Spanish-speaking guy at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely fun! <br /> <br /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who just played man to Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wished it was on DVD because my VHS recording gets a bit old. <br /> <br /> I had no interest in seeing remake with Woody Allen because it can in no way match the original.
