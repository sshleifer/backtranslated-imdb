It ran from 1959-1973. It is more than its lifetime that says a lot to this series. It is also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50s, psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I can remember repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it extraordinary. Lorne Green had its defining iconic character from this series. The complaint was across generations. All family members could enjoy this. The balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated, and many will not know its importance.
