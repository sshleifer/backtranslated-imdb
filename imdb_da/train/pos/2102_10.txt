As I sat down to see 'Largo Winch', I didn't expect more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I have seen both of these; and much more. <br /> <br /> Finally, Karl Roden was not the antagonist of a movie at first. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both performing excellently. In Radivoje Bukvic, Goran described well. <br /> <br /> The mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but I understand why people would be bored with it. <br /> <br /> The scenery in Hong Kong and especially the amazing Croatian baths both surprised me and I would hardly take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; This is their movie. It is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, extreme beauty landscapes and above all a fast and well-written action movie with dazzling combat and a thoroughly forced inner drama. <br /> <br /> My voice, as stated by a gloomy day, is: 10/10
