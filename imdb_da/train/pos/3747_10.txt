I have never seen many online movies for most of my life, but if I wanted to choose any of them, I would choose Spatel Madness, a smart reference to most movies like star troops (etc.) Using a camera and wits of steel, Jason Steele mastered the art of transforming a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas. the story begins in the middle, how is it for directors pleasure? then the middle is at first, and so on, when I first looked at it, I expected a soft pixely look, but Jason, Like me, Loves looks, then every detail took to the max. although I do not recommend it to children, or would anyone except me like it, but please look it up online (it's a short film, watch the movie queue), my style reminds me of south park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for grin and 6 for the story it all goes to a 10/10, good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm eager to watch the movie.
