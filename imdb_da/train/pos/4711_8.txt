Oh how fun is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a flair for controlling comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here it seems she told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton beats through the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame director doesn't pick up on this. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I don't think it's an accident that most of the character's name is spelled MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines sprinkled through the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines. Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale come in good lines. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
