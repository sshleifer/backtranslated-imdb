Despite beautiful and breathtaking animations, this is probably one of the most uninspiring Disney movies I've seen, and I don't particularly like Disney movies. Spirit is a wild stallion who is repeatedly caught, either by the cavalry or by the Indians, who both try to "break" him. The spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and it is in a nutshell story. With the exception of the horse's beautiful animation, neither my nor my five-year-old was much inspired or excited by this film. It is ironic that it is called "Spirit", as spirit is what this film could have used a little more. An extra point was given to the soundtrack, which was fun with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And even though this movie is classified G, you will likely have to end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means for your five-year-old. I did that. <br /> <br />
