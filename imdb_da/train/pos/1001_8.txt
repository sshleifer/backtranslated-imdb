Somewhat fun and well-functioning action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a rude, fast-paced hoodlum, chosen by an over-demanding American tax consultant (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to find a demanding computer thief / hacker (Doug Hutchinson) who stole two million dollars from the Treasury and left two guards shot dead. "Bait" marks the sophomore feature of Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task quite well, although it does not practice his first film. What the two films have in common is the action sequences that are flat excellent. Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is annoying at first, but in the whole movie I began to catch on. Hutchinson is wonderful as a mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the brilliant plan to get the one who did it at all costs.
