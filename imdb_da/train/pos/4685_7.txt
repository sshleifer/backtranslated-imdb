In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992) Sean Young plays a gritty D.A. in Atlanta. She is a single family who becomes too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin), who forms a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes them off and leaves them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this hard lonely decides to enter the life of the false shutterbug by constituting his prey that intends to bring him to justice. They meet, they love, so the next thing she knows she's over her lap is spanked. (Note: The spanking scene is only in the "urated" version of this movie. The R-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more wise.) This psychological thriller contains several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images like Bergin chases one of her victims around the room, flailing on her with a riding crop. As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is the best when Sean Young plays his cat and mouse game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating action. It is unfortunate that the film does not end, it just stops. It is true. Director Lizzie Borden may just have run out of history to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits are running, and we are left with an enigmatic "what just happened?" confusion. <br /> <br /> The development of Young's plan is played in engaging style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a rejection for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Then (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
