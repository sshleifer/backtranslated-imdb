A sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffers from the usual shenanigans of Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as an actual successor to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for the sake of continuity. Talking about Ann Sheridan, she's the only true light in this movie. To rewrite a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and I would buy DVD! Another virtue in this movie is the chain between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
