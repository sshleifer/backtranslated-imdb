The "Stories of the Century" was a half hour series and appeared in the first round syndication in '54 -'55 tv season. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy award. Starring veteran Western actor Jim Davis as rail detective Matt Clark, the series put Clark and his co-detective partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" in the second half) against historic Western crimes of various periods spanning from the mid-1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to see and pretty realistic, mainly due to Jim Davis' unpleasant charm in the lead. He seemed like a really western character. Another note. When Matt Clark was to come to town after a long trip, he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride, as he would be covered with dust. A very good early adult western.
