Saw this on cable back in the early 90s and loved it. Never seen it again until it appeared on cable again recently. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why it's not higher. I found everything about this movie compelling. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this movie is more exciting now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people watching. The human toll on our soldiers is not back on the battlefield. Its brought home for the rest of that living. And this movie is one of many that brings the home in a very hard way. Excellent movie.
