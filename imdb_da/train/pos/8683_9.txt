"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the important early episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as murderers) that play roughly the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp Brimmer, the leader of a large private detective company asked to investigate, is playing a wife for a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr Kennicut. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut in the hope that he can extort his wife in return for extracting information about her husband's business relations. She reacts poorly to this proposal, an argument that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer strikes her face. Because he has a big ring, the battle strikes her to the ground and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be in manual reading, even though it's actually a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without admitting he knows the killer had a ring. Columbo is Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when the time is right to turn the screws a little. So at first, he plays goofily a part of a rather simple minded man who gets excited by the "lifeline goes over the moon's heights" or an equally ridiculous palm tree reads the mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his company that effectively beats him to stop brushing his nose around. Again, Columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's another where Columbo tells Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wants the killer to hear their conversation. He wants to suggest Brimmer that he is on him without blaming him directly, so he is quite cruel (but understandable in the circumstances) deciding to play mind games on Brimmer to joke him in panic and do something stupid. Which of course he does! Yet the grieving Kennicut is unaware of the subtitle of this conversation. It is only at the end that Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I won't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang for rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved. .. A really really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series. If you liked it, then you also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
