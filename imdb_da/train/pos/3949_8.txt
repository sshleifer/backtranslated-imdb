Like many people on this site, I only saw this movie once when it was first twisted in 1971. Certain scenes are in my memory and a general feeling of trouble is how I remember being affected by it. I would be fascinated to see it again if ever made available to home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic setup and characters might be derived from a 1960 British movie, originally titled City of the Dead, Horror Hotel resumed for the US release? There are also similarities to a later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> A detail remains with me years after watching the movie. It is a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. As I recall, a minister and his wife have stopped to help some people along the way, around 1870, somewhere out west. The friendly apparently Ray Milland introduces himself and his (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young dumb woman. While the sermon helps Ray Milland with the cart, a rattlesnake strikes and spins menacingly, observed by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She doesn't look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration until it goes away. At this strange little moment we already understand that there is something very unusual about these seemingly normal people, even though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> One little scene remains with me alive after all these years with many others. The film has a scary quality about what will not escape, and it is not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make this available for home video!
