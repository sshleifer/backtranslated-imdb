I recently watched this movie and enjoyed it very much. It gives an insight into indie filmmaking and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget, but needs a name actor / actress to get people, any people to come see it and give the film exposure. Bobby Myeres, played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, makes an excellent combination of finding eccentric Miachel Bates, a "NAME" actor played by Alan Bates, was a perfect casting decision in the movie and film. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with his own special achievement again in the movie in the movie. If you enjoy thinking when you see a comedy, then this is for you. Low budget meets lower budget with high ridiculous content.
