I understand this movie as a debut feature and as such it is very impressive. It has the feeling and pacing of a "true indie", but director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The shoots are well framed and well thought out and serve to move the story forward. He and writer Ivan Salomon delivers a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts. It's a story that requires the Judd Hirsch caliber sign talent to get a shot at work. Judd is amazing as usual; who is Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to coax shade out of the young actor into a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach. Anyway, I found the movie refreshing and entertaining.
