This is undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made. It is almost incomprehensible even with many repetitive prospects in an attempt to find out what is happening. The film was almost completely improvised and contains random musical tracks, advertisements, competitions that you enter by post and a host of other innovations. Moreover, what other movies have cameos by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the movie, chase the director's book titled I was curious. It becomes quite clear. It is a great and courageous experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. And triumph. Now, if only someone would exhibit a version with the subtitles of a color * other * than white ... the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
