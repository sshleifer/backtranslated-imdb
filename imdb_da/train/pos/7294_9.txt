After reading several comments I felt that I also had to add in my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I've ever seen. I had the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially in such a short time. The story is focused on a young girl who is the victim of her violent father. She soon gets the opportunity to "stop" him with a demon played by "Witchblade Eric Etebari." After seeing the show, I was amazingly impressed by how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could trade so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very convincing. The action was absolutely amazing to him. The girl was okay and the father was decent. There is also death in this one who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and the cinematography were totally mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least one hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare that you see such a high quality card. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable to any major feature film. This is not to say that it is not without its faults - I thought it took a little getting started and the intro was a bit long. But this is stuck in my head days after seeing it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality.
