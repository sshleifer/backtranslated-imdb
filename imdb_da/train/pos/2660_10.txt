When I first went to The Shining, I expected a decent movie from what I had heard about it, and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubrick's other work, but when I started to see it, it was so much better than I thought it would be. At times I felt seriously uneasy and I couldn't see my screens on the screen, but there is something very worrying about everything in the movie. Now, some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining, as it doesn't quite follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both Kubrick's version, mini-series and book are all great. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance. If you're looking for a good original movie that keeps you thinking, even after the movies over, watch The Shining.
