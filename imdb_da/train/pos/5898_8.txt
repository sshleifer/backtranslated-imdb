Penny Princess finds American working girl Yolande Donlon the inheritance of a small kingdom located in the triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet called Lampidorra. It seems that Lampidorrans owes bills across Europe, and its main occupation smuggles because of its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course, the property must go through probate in America and what should Lampidorrans do? Especially since Donlan, now a princess, has banned smuggling. Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on tour to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that Lampidorrans has a kind of cheese that the playful refers to as Schmeeze. With a few bumps in the road, Schmeeze solves all the problems financially, geopolitically and romanticly between Donlan and Bogarde. How does Schmeeze work, that's good, it's gimmick for the whole movie. But here's a tip. In Lover Come Back Jack Kruschen could just have gotten hold of Schmeeze's secret when he was busy perceiving VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. Anyway Penny Princess is a wonderful mix of British farce and Romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have been thrown in if the film had been made on this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well thrown into the part that at the beginning of his career was like a romantic heartbeat, well before anyone, but he suspected he had the working chops he had. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was shown at three in the morning at TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
