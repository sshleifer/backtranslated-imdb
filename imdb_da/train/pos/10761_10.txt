My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to see it with her. She is from China and only heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more about the documentary. I felt terrible looking at this documentary, it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to the eyes. <br /> <br /> But I am very grateful that I saw this documentary because on September 11, I am sure we all remember where we were and what we did when we heard we everyone could only think of certain issues: "Why?", "How?", "What happens?", "Oh my God!". Almost all Americans were grateful for the brave firefighters and policemen who risked their lives to save others. But I don't think we were thinking about what they really did. This was actually not supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, the cameraman just filmed a typical day at work, and they just happened to be a few blocks away from the World Trade Centers and got everything, outside and on tape. <br /> <br /> On September 11, I thought of myself "It's okay, the cops and firefighters get the people who survived." To be honest, I thought it was an accident I was in my junior year in high school and was changed from the gym and ready to go to my science class. Someone came into the closet and shouted, "Some buildings were just bombed in New York!" We all dressed up quickly and ran to our classrooms when we saw the first tower burning on TV. Not only 15 seconds later, live on television, the other plane collides in the second World Trade Center, and we knew it was not by chance. A few minutes later we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane going to Chicago but was shot down. So many thoughts ran through my head, and I continued to think, "What should firefighters and policemen do?" But that's the procedure for those I thought they know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew that so many lives are now gone, the second tower crashed, it would never be the same. The firefighters in this documentary showed courage, confusion and strength, the real raw human emotions. They didn't know what to do, they were just as ardent as the other people in the towers. They heard the bodies collapse on the ground from people jumping out of the windows. And here I was in a classroom and just crying to see everything that was going on TV. I was amazed at this movie and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help. I know they feel they just did their job, but they did more, they were heroic. Every day after September 11 for 3 weeks they kept digging and knew there were no survivors, but they were hoping and praying. May God bless their kind and courageous hearts. <br /> <br /> As for my roommate, she cried and admitted that it was her first time crying at these attacks. She had to see the truth about what had happened on the tragic day. She asked "Why?" I did not know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be evil. "It sounds clique", but it was a normal day for everyone, "one of the firefighters said in the documentary. No one expected this to happen. Not so, the people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or the aircraft being hijacked , just did their job, happened to be there, or even there was only one second past, they were not just murdered, they were slaughtered, and the hijackers did it with a song in their heart, then in the Middle East look all the people celebrating Do people do this? They celebrated death and lost: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins ​​etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Thanks to them for making this documentary. You really think of the firefighters, policemen and troops in Iraq, and it keeps your hope that there are good people in this world, thanks to all these people, you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
