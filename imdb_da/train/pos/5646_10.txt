Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the box-office of American Gothic, and I thought 'I remember it!' I used to set my alarm to come back and see this as it was on CH 4 in 1996 at. 30:30 (I was 14). I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no one could ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!) No one ever was. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me was that they did the same with the box set as when they were on TV. Episodes in fun order, I kept thinking when did Dr Matt go away ??? - They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> But this is not the authors, the producer or the director error (its TV people in the background, the banking institutions. They do the same. Just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape, they don't like originality in the studios !!! !!) To quit - If you haven't seen this and you call yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama. FAN = YOU MUST. They even said the same thing in SFX when they went through the box set.
