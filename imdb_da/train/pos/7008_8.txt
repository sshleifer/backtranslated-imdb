WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not at all a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Normally, I don't like dramas. I'm not Will Smith super fan, even thinking he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a fantastic movie with such an original script and so good direction and so good working ... wow ... it's great. This movie caught my attention minute by minute, and I also didn't like the "pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because I didn't like acting like Will's son, who is a very bad actor, while children usually seem all natural born actors, I also saw him last night in "the day the earth stood still" and I confirmed my feeling that the Jade cannot act). I don't want to write spoilers and so I'm not talking about the story, but what I can say is that this movie talks about love, death and other emotions that I don't like to watch in movies .... but THIS MOVIE is like that a super good movie. If you have a minimum of heart, you will not regret seeing it
