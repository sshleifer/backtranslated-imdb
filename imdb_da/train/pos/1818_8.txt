I watched this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it wasn't until I saw it again at age 13 that I really understood it; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a true heart of gold "adopts" a little girl to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, is murdered by his formal business partner, Carface (who is completely gloomy by the way). His soul then goes to whereever the sky is only to find a golden watch that is truly the life of his life, which Charlie is the stinging but lovable cad that he steals and returns and sends him back to Earth. Once back on the ground, Charlie goes to seek revenge on the evil Carface. How to get over young Anne-Marie, the lonely little orphan who can talk to animals, as Charlie plans to scam for her talents to get back to his enemy Carface. But scoundrel Charlie is actually going to take care of young Anne-Marie and his plans are incomplete as he has to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovers what her "best friend" Charlie has really used her to make money for a new and better dog casino. Now he has to save her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this movie, even at the age of 22. The idea and plot is really quite different from original from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays a role for the villain. Carface was even better than he was in all dogs going to heaven sequel. In this picture, he seemed quite doubtful about his role of villain.
