Two sailors are on holiday - ladies man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more, but you've probably guessed it. The story (even for a musical music from the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and healthy - gets annoying quite quickly. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes, and that's too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring songs by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. It's still worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson sings, it gets magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you don't care about. It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the smooth MGM had. The action is ok - Kelly is fine (though he sees it as a ladies man pushing it) and Sinatra is just amazing (even though he saw HIM as a shy guy, it also pushed!). Grayson is given nothing to do, but she is incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots from her literally took the breath! There are lots of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's great dance and song number; Sinatra sings something; Grayson's two songs and the fairly famous animated order where Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also makes a fun como. There's also little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in. So it's too long and the plot just doesn't stop, but it's still worth catching. This was a big hit in his time.
