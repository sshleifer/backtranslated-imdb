I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I looked at the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled upon this fine movie. We had no idea what this was about, but it turned out spectacularly. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the movie was shot and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a fun movie that also makes you believe, I suggest you quickly go to your local video store and find this movie. I will tell you some of my favorite parts, but it can ruin the movie for you so I don't want to. This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of great movies. Do you really think nothing is skipped?
