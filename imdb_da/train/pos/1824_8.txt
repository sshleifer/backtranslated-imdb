All dogs go to heaven is a movie that I always wanted. When I was a kid, I used to see it here every other day. It is underestimated if you look at its IMDb rating and comments from many people in general. This is not a bad movie, as many say it is a very good movie. This is good and your children will probably like it. Although it is classified G, some parents may find it here to be a little violent. It's actually a pretty dark story, where dogs look like mobsters involved in games, extortion and even cold-blooded murders. The movie follows a dog named Charlie, who had fled the pound, being killed by his old friend, going to heaven, but ending up getting back to earth. Many younger children watching this movie can feel like they are watching a big kids movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare young children, but I'm sure they'll do fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, it's the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are amazing, and it's the last movie a little girl named Judith Barsi was in. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, a shame because she had so much potential and Don't deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can't see that movie any more, because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is amazing, the voice work is great and the story is good but slightly different from many other kids movies. This was popular at the time of its release, but was overshadowed by Disney's most popular The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that is not devised by adults, but if you are a child or if you grew up with this movie as a child, then I am sure you will enjoy watching it.
