(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical accuracy can be questionable ... (and with the mass appeals the inaccurate LOTR .. such things more easily excused now) I liked the art nose of it. Although not really an art house film. It gives little emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispers from time to time, is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
