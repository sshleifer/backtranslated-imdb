Certain DVDs hold me until I just have to go buy it. This was one of those movies. Like many in here, I remember it as a child and loved it. I never knew there were scenes and tracks that were cut, so I was thrilled to see what they could be. I would agree that the "Portabellow Road" sequence is now a bit slow (as is the football game), but apart from that, I didn't find any problems with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the rendered version on the front so people could choose what they wanted to see. All in all, it is still an entertaining movie that still manages to resume some of my childhood memories.
