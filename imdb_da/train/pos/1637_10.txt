I love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It gets better with each view. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is cruel and brutally realistic as the prairie's life was these days. I found myself making comments when I saw it. Someone here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't disagree more. He is brilliant as a dour, miserable Clyde Stewart, who says little and works like a slave / workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is great as widow Elinor, who Clyde hires as housekeeper / cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandmother. Also a star is the strong Montana prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal country to settle in. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a fantastic perfect music score and a good script. When you first see Heartland, you will never forget it. It deserves all the 10s it comes here.
