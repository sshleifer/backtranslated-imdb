This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main author of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and citizens of the cute caps. The film will tell you why Rickie and Julian are starting to make their more sophisticated communications to the world of crime. Why and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler, so I will not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades. Their friend and often-time partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing the movie won't affect the way you look sit-com a bit. It is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time villains with small time ideas but great time dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to see - buy - steal this program grab it. You will be glad you did. And to my American friends --- it will break you up too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV how tv should be
