I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was hit by how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims deteriorates most, the camera continues. The lingering shots of his body are uncovered, and his concentration camp figure is zipped into a body bag moving and depressing. Don't watch this movie if you're already depressed. so again don't see it if you feel really good.
