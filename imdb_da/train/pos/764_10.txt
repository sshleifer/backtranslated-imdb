Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best movie about the breakin scene. Everything about it is the place on, the clothes (puma), the music and most importantly the dance! The story is basic, but hey what is there to tell a story about? The whole point of the movie is to show what children at the moment did in time, what was important to them. It shows that teenagers are generally good, all that matters to these daily children was music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was plesantly surprised at how well it had been the time trial! The clothes were not dated (possibly because Puma now has a massive comeback), the music still sounds fresh, and the dance is still captivating to see. A movie, every 10-25 years old, should look like part of their youth culture.
