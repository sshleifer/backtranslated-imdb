From rainy, bad, late winter England in the early 1920s ... --- where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled veterinarians from the great slaughter of men and the killer of their women's dreams - known now as World War I ... four women share this lovely little sunny Italian castle on a hill; a young widow who drowns her grief in a hectic party, two women who will rediscover their own men and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends ... These four women will join two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for a great April holiday in the early 1920s in Italy. NOTE to would filmers. Examine this movie for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie to please many men ...) <br /> NOTE: Prepare for coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls on a boring late winter day ... Spring is coming ... Enchanted April promises you!
