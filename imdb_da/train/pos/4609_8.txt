Probably Jackie Han's best film in the 1980s, and the one who put him on the map. The scope of this self-recorded police drama is evident from opening and closing scenes during which a squatters village and shopping mall are deleted. There are distinct differences between the original Chinese and duplicated English versions, with many of the jokes not making their way into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars that do not resemble anything like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that the dubbing has corrected is the trial ?? At that time, attempts in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Han's fighting style and martial arts choreography injects humor wherever possible, so non-Cantonese audiences don't miss much. After all, it is not the dialogue that makes a Chan flick, but the action and the painful withdrawals. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an indestructible Hong Kong detective, pursuing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and is tasked with protecting a star science (Brigitte Lin). The action is fantastic from start to finish, and there is not much time to breathe in between. It will never make you think, but what an entertaining, well-tense, movie. This is probably one of the best martial arts movies out there.
