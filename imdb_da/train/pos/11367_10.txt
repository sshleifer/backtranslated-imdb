Caution: May contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie 3 times and I've wanted it every time. When I see it again, I am always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie - very well done as most of their movies are - this would have got Oscars because it was performances if it had been released for general distribution rather than made for television. <br /> <br /> As I am sure someone by reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people over the age of 8 in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so he was only sentenced to 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on forensic analyst Victor Burakov played perfectly to Stephen Rea. A man who is tortured and obsessed with finding this murderer despite the additional hurdles placed by party hacks is his part essential to being safe. There is a very touching scene at the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken by serial killer cases after 18 months, whether or not they want due to the mental strain and frustration. According to this program, Burakov worked for over 5 years before he got his first break from it. He followed the case to his conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superiors, General Fetisov, Donald Sutherland, actually told him that he admires his commitment and apologizes for not knowing that he should have given him a break before. <br /> <br /> Reas performance is so well done, he does not exaggerate, chew on stage or do anything that distracts from his depiction of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man of passion, but does not show it in the same way as it is usually portrayed in detective films. He only gives occasional outbreaks after standing up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't have to overload. He's just * * - His character, so frustrated after so long, at some point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than no one in a year. Of course, what he thinks is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel like this man. He makes us understand, but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility. <br /> <br /> A mutant to be sure was Chikatilos childhood, producing such "monsters". The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible even though it may seem) evokes some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us terribly wrong? In any way, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a good job. He begins to appear to be a cynical secular official who does not seem much more interested in assisting the investigation than anyone else is blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very good trip by Max Von Sydow which the psychiatrist brought in to help the profile and find out what kind of deviant they are looking for. Although this film deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it is really more about what is required to capture a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well made film with fine performances and a good manuscript. The play manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: Give the actual events and place them meaningfully into a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people * behind * the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
