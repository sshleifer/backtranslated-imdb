Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, Rostov's Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years, especially women and children. It shows how the investigation was prevented by Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will not leave anyone untouched. At first, it may be a little slow, but it really takes you when the story unfolds. I can only say that, besides "The Lambs Silence", this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say which actor performance stands out above the rest of this movie. Stephen Rea is truly brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert responsible for the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior, and the only one in the Russian government willing to help him is just as excellent as Rea. And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann, the serial killer? DuMan brilliantly created a sign that inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, repressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his colleagues ... He is being tortured, ashamed and extremely evil. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie to anyone interested in a well-crafted documentary where the actors are still more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
