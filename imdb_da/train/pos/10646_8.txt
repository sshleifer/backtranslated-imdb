This amazing movie consists mostly of documentary films currently featured on a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and narrator Frank Capra made these films, which simply and attentively address the key points that caused World War II and Hitler's rise. All schoolchildren, no, all Americans should look at these movies today because they are so apropos. History has repeated itself again and again! The Lord Chamberlain's still lives and kicks; The tactics used by the Nazis to the infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups still work on the benefit of this evil group. <br /> <br /> By sitting and letting Hitler stand as early as 1935 aggressive - France, America, and England caused over 50 million people to die. The Americans, French and British today would be happy to let Hitler do the same, despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties. <br /> <br /> These amazing movies can be too simplistic for World War I history buffs. They do not tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was with them, Hitler fought. This film tells the common facts and motives that led to the terrible war.
