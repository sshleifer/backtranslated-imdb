This cartoon was strange, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion than the other movie. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and hardly any other friends, except a brother and sister who are just miserable as she is. She reaches the ultimate low, and when the opportunity arises, she literally makes a covenant with a devil-like demon. I found this movie to be very true to life, and when things couldn't get worse, the girl sees what she's done, feels remorse and changes, and then helps this dark, mysterious creature learn the human quality of love. The twins also improve by helping the little bears, and they also get a sense of self-esteem. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were strange, it was and still a pretty enjoyable movie. The music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the movie even better
