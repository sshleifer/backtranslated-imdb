From the start I knew I wanted to be in for the best movie that saw the experience of my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots manned by brilliant people, fighting each other for control of the world, was the most intense and thoughtful of plot I've ever experienced. I can't even begin to describe the brilliant play and well-written script. Let's just say that it compares to both Lord of Rings images, combined. The academy had great oversight not to celebrate the joy that is ..... ROBOT JOX.
