This is the kind of picture John Lassiter would make today if it wasn't for CGI progress. And it's just to say that he would also be forgotten if the technology hadn't done anything sexy and kewl since 1983. _Twice ... has got the same joke, fantasy and sense of true excitement that you would find in a Pixar -girl is only performed under the limitations of the media c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a fantastic script and excellent voicing to produce a film that appeals to many levels. It should be spoken in the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
