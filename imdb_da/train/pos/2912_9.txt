We throw around the term "superstar" too easily these days, but here is a guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was glued to the kit this whole show. The song selection was perfect - it only contained the songs I actually wanted to hear and cut with documentary films under the weaker new songs. I loved that the band was only five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength, you don't need a circus to be entertained). <br /> <br /> The shots from the audience were also amazing. How many artists can influence the original Beatles fans (now in their 50's and over), get young children to jump up in the opening lines "Can't buy me love" and influence everyone in between? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that in the wake of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney immediately became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (whatever their final relationship was, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to really get the recognition Lennon's murder had Received. I agree that Lennon's murder was terrible, but only now did I understand that Paul was forgotten in the aftermath. I was very happy that he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those who complained about audio / video quality, I had no complaints at all; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out; they are never satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret was not buying a ticket for this show when I had the chance. Thanks to this video, I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he is remembered for his music first. And let's hope another lunatic won't change this because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
