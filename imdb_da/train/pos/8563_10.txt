The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (translates as "The Most Beloved of People"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that became something like The Bible or Hamlet's History , very popular and difficult to get because of its satirical content over the communist regime. It represents the intellectual man's drama, the humanist, in a "red" world. A movie filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological charge (it is after all a European film).
