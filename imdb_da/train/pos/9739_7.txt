I was having fun watching this movie, mainly because of Simon Pegg, who has quickly become a solid image office for comedy films. He is hired from his deadly end London publisher job of big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges, who authored one of his celebrity clothes. After paying his treasure, he makes it to the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom (the seventh room) where he comes to be a smaller celebrity himself. The story is a lot of fun, and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supportive role as a slam privilege. </p> <p> On the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. The Formula Plot aside, the movie was very fun, primarily due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the interest of love. The rest of the stuff did his job well. <br /> <br /> This was a great comedy and worth checking out at the theaters.
