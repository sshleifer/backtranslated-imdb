Buddy is an entertaining family movie at a time when "humanize" animals, and making them sweet was an accepted way of getting people interested in. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows great love that the protagonists have too expensive and for each other and that they will do something for each other. <br /> <br /> Although not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is the most lively, and most of the time home-made mayhem is usually fun for kids. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks the opportunity to make the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but shows the difficulties. <br /> A recommended movie that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
