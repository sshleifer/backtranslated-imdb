Basically, I like Verhoeven's film because in her film I enjoy a brilliant psychosocial story that I have previously seen in "Basic Instinct". It really is a wonderful thriller I enjoyed a lot. So of course it is for me to watch this other Verhoeven movie. It's his previous direction before his block buster hit "Basic Instinct" and for that I was very curious to watch the movie and yes, the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psychosocial drama, which is a thin bit complex for some audiences. The story of this movie is about a homosexual, called "Reve" (Crab), an alcoholic who lives on his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. After completing his lecture, a seductive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past, introduces her not to reveal. Try to make sex with her in her house as she is a boy. The next morning he sees his sexy, macho girlfriend picture on her table the person he met at the station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house. <br /> <br /> That's it. I don't want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really surprising! Especially I like the character "Reve", which brilliantly played by "Crab" I am pretty much his actor, because as a gay person I am purely identified with his character and yes, I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
