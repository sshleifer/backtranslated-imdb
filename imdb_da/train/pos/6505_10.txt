Theo Robertson commented that WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after WWI, which led to Hitler's rise and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first and a quarter hour volume 8? Includes this period and along with the previous volumes in the series shows the existing conditions I feel. One of my friends grew up in Germany during this period and became Hitler Youth himself, and his experiences were very similar to those in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is so far above the history channel's documentary I also own that there is no comparison. The only fault and it is a small one I have with WAW is this: The numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about lending, so how much military equipment was lent / leased? How much to Russia, how much to Britons? How many merchant ships did the U-boats fall and when? How many ships does the German or Japanese fleet have in total 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops do the Allies have in all and by country? Lots of numbers could have made many viewers nodded, but I would have preferred more! And of course I always want to see more military analysis. Like why did Patton & Clark not fall into the German army that was in Cassini after they had surrounded it, instead of driving Monty to Rome and letting it escape? I don't think you can begin to understand the war until you've seen some of these video segments on "total war", like the fire bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc. Before you see the rocks in the death camps: You just can't wrap your head around it - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time and of course, unfiltered, the Japanese were the most cruel atrocities and inhumanities, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys") and some live vivisection of medical "experimental" prisoners without any anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
