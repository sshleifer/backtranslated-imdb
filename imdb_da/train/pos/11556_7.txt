Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and joined their careers together. Remember best as the most beautiful of old men as well as the strange couple who have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most beloved comedy teams in the last 100 years. Not as "raunchy" as Pryor and Wilder, instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed mix of chaos as Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In Oddparet, Lemmon and Matthau play complete contradictions that create chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as the captains. The wit is usually on itself as opponents against passing the joke on another. Not your typical movie, it's kind of an upcoming comedy with two old men as against two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is enough entertainment. Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a great comedy.
