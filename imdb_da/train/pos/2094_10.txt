Sure, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was filmed. But colleagues IMDB members, come on, this movie is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It is a 10. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw at the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive still looks at scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always engaging, for me it was MGM film making at its best. What felt the audience as they glimpsed a St. John's attack, the person of human destruction of a mansion, the terrible poverty and then the wealth of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those who watched the Academy Awards had a glimpse of the "senior" Oscar winner, Luise Rainer. How great to see an actress who has reasonably delivered one of the most masterful, joking ideas in history that chooses to return to a party. Okay, so she shouldn't have won the year before (Great Ziegfeld), but don't blame Luise. Talkies were only ten years old when this was released and the dialogue was limited. But as Olan, her use of visual and vocals is memorable. <br /> <br /> Big scale and touching, what more can a movie lover wish!
