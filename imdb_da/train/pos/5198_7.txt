What can you say about Mr Moore? He's the grandfather's grandfather, he's the king of Z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Do you like it? This movie is a widespread rollercoaster of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and a lot of other things you would never find in most modern movies (or any movie, really, haha!). The stand-up routine he gives early is not to be missed! In any case, D2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and has no class! I'm gon 'rock this shotgun up his * bip * a **!"
