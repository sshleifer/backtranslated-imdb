Definitely one of the finest movies I've seen for some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving movie. Denzel Washington so far plays one of its most engaging and emotional roles, and the rest of the cast performs beautifully. Of course, Christopher Walken is fantastic in his part, although he did not seem as often as I would have liked. A story of the ultimate greed that remains is set off for the child's innocence and love. This is also a movie for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of seed and corruption, which in itself is an eye-opener. All in all, a really moving movie from the beginning to the end. Highly recommended!
