This movie is fun! I saw it with my friend and we just had to see it again. This movie is not for your movie guests who only see the films nominated for the Academy Awards (you know who you are.) I will not recreate it because you have seen it from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a light hearted comedy that made me laugh all the way through. It does not take itself too seriously and should be seen with your friends, not your boyfriend. It won't win any prizes, but it just needs to be seen. True, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of it sometimes. Some people need to look up and see "whipped" for what it is, not what it is. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 out of *****.
