The sopranoes are perhaps the most mind-opening series you might ever see. It's smart, it's fun, it's fun - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist seeing. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters lying in the underground world of New York's crime families. For the most part, you really do not know if the wise guys will put someone in the back or buy them lunch. <br /> <br /> Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - It's dangerous men, most of them killers, but of God if you don't love them also. I've laughed at their wisecracks, been torn down when they made mistakes in the sentence, and felt scared of the serious recklessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting in New Jersey is perfect for this show's subtitle - people are not always the way they look and the sharp contrast between humdrum and the actions that these seemingly petty criminals make is up to evenly the chances. <br /> <br /> If you don't already have one, you absolutely must.
