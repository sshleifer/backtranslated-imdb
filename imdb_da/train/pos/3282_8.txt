Not knowing what this movie was about, I checked it out in the video store and after seeing it, I enjoyed it. Small set of multi-genre flick from director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Fantastic history and character. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, it is worth renting.
