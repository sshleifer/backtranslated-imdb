World At War is perhaps the greatest documentary series all the time. The historical research is almost flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and final documentary on WW2. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. I recommend it as an educational experience.
