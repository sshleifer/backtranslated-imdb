I do not understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting movie actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is the writing and the white. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, absolutely not stock types. Although you can't say that their characters are well-developed, it doesn't make them less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so it was definitely not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated movie judged by the exceptionally low score IMDb members has given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth at least 7. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and big money at the box office is much less interesting.
