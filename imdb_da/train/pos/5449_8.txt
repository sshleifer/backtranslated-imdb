Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (songs from Red Hot Chili Peppers) is the father of this movie. Blackie Dammit is Anthony's father. I noticed this after reading "Scar Tissue" Anthony's autobiography and saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Yes, that guy looks like the guy from the movie I saw in the eighties. Then I read more and said his father was an actor who had some minor roles. After checking this site and Compared to a search on the web, I realized that it really is his father in the movie, it's funny because nowhere in the book does he mention he's in this movie, maybe his son was ashamed of his father's play in this flick, But he doesn't need to be, I think his father, Blackie, did a good job on the show.
