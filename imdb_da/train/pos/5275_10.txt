This movie is amazing! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a movie showing Muslims as humans, no stereotypes here. This film is driven by the story, by the actor and above all by its theme, namely, cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like clich√©s, but they are not, at least not in this movie. Vista of the Great Mosque in Mecca is amazing, and the audience gets a glimpse of a side of Muslim world rarely ever shown in the West. Here, people are caring, supportive, devoted, tolerant and devoted to each other. What a welcome and delayed departure from the Arabs' usual negative depictions. Excellent movie.
