This is actually a trilogy of 3 short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very comfortable. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is dismissed from his church's job because he cannot read or write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco store, of course! The other is Mr. Know-All, who was actually a story I had read to school 6 years ago and immediately forgot until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minute and also very good. It worked better on movies than in a book for me, but maybe it's because I was only 14 last time, after all. The 3rd is almost a disappointment. Almost an hour in length, it simply pulls. It's not that bad, but not as fast and snappy as the last 2. I saw the first quarter of it and then jumped to the last quarter hour and found that it was still reasonable and I really didn't miss a thing! Overall, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively.
