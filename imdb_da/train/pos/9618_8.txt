I recently purchased this movie and I do not regret having it at all. I am very much, please have this movie added to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month to film and spent about EUR 1 million to produce this amazing movie. This shows that not only large productions make amazing movies. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language BUG means program errors that cause reactions in computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also good beauty moments. The horrible events in this movie begin with the death of a BUG. A man testifies to the "crime" across the road ... Then everything becomes complicated ... I point out John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who can't do everything right at all.
