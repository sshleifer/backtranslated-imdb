I originally caught this in 1996 in his one-week run in a movie theater. I was impressed with it and my feelings have not changed much. <br /> <br /> Documenting the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and film. There are interviews with people who have worked with him or known him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugos Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from movies or some bizarre recreation. It's interesting (something), but was it really necessary? I've seen every Woods movie and they're just awful. Wood had ambitions, but not a little talent to do them. I didn't want to say he was the worst director ever, but he's down there. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film producer? I like that they didn't try to make Wood a saint. More than a few of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated a little man and it comes through loud and clear. They also ignore their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. It's still interesting if you're a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a long girlfriend).
