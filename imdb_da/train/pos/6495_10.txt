10 out of 10, this brilliant super-documentary is a must see with movie clips from the war that people have not seen for years until this was screened in 1974. The movie clips in this documentary from the war do not miss anything, some of the rocks left me dumbstuck. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a great story of war. It's still probably still the best documentary for war, and now over 25 years it's still possible to pack a huge punch. You have to see this at some point, even though it is some episodes, even in that you will still be blown away by the effect this documentary means for those who have been there and died in the name of WAR, in a world in war ..
