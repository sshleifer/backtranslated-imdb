It's a short movie from David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it has all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, unimaginable, scary and strange; And before the blonde girl starts talking it is even a little scary! The soundtrack is unusual to create this odd atmosphere because it is also creepy and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> The setting itself does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but it has sucking purple painted walls, giving it an equally great effect of annoyance. <br /> <br /> plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and she is crying for help; Then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way and says she is there just because of her fault ?? We do not know what happened or what will happen next ?? it ended unresolved and enigmatic as a good Lynch movie must end! <br /> <br /> It's a big card, despite some amateur plays. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their plays could have been better in this short.
