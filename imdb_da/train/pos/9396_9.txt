In any number of movies you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong, silence, Dennis Hopper as a homicidal maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp, and that late, J.T. Walsh as the heavy. It is these types of roles that these four can play in their sleep, and they have made it so often that they can see them playing boundaries on the cliche again. What relief that John Dahl, a master of getting a lot of mood out of a little action, instructed this nuanced noirish thriller. Hopper manages to keep from going over the top, Cage shows a little more depth than his usual superficial actresses, Boyle, on the other hand, is hungry, innocent and ashamed, and you get a sense of the rare iron of the soul, which is central to his character , Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of emptiness in the Big Sky country where history takes place, while being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change in the plot of the store. The plots are top notch, and one of the other great phrases in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually seem to have brains. It is not often that smaller figures such as deputy sheriffs have more brains than their overall superiors. But with an instructor as smart as Dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of something related to this movie. An excellent movie.
