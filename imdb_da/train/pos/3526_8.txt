Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br/> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after an eerie fight and split with his wife, seems to Drowning his sorrows at the local watering hole. There, he spies a woman in a similar emotional state, looking for a couple of companies, asking her for a show at a club to get both their thoughts of their problems. She agrees, but only on condition that they keep their names to themselves. Certainly, when Scott comes home, he finds the police there and waits to question him. His wife has been murdered. Where were you at 8 in the evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott, but not the woman. Not even the cab. Neither drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even the dancer in the club, which Scott clearly had to look at the woman (they both had the same hat), would not recognize that there was anyone with him. Something happens, but whatever Scott is, he is helpless to defend himself in a lawsuit and sentenced to death for his wife's murder (on the rudest "evidence" in Hollywood's legal history). It is left to its loyal secretary, 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who was later joined by a sympathetic inspector Burgess, to find out the real killer before Scott is executed. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is built on themes that repeat, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is the sign that becomes mentally uninhibited by the death of a boyfriend or spouse found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can let a viewer feel that he is stepping on well-worn ground. But in the right hands, the feverish plots, discouraging dialogue, the narrative inconsistencies, are all beside that point. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was ruled by healthy hands. <br /> <br /> This is Siodma's first noir. He would continue to distinguish himself as one of them, if not the prominent style of the style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is confidently mated with film photographer Woody Bredell (they would be reunited on Christmas holiday and The Killers). There are some amazing stories made in the camera. In a shot, the degrading mental state of a character appears as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror, indicating more personalities. The same character as an artist has Van Gogh's self-portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall of his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell really do in the Phantom Lady creates virtually noir. Published very early in 1944, it is all here; the wet pavement, the atmosphere and the fear, the sharp contrasting b & w, the wildly expressionist versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), the inconsistent light shafts, etc. It is a great picture to look at. <br /> <br /> The Franchot Tone aside, the cast, as well as the subject and relative inexperience of the instructor (and presumably the budget) suggest 'B' movie ambitions. I thought Tone was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not too much, and actually comes in quite a few scenes. Ella Raines is mostly good (and pretty). Her 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr. is so scary, it must be seen as being believed. Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him. It forms a hunting scene as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets, with stops at a subway station. Some really good tensions in there. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4
