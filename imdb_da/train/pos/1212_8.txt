Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it. Yes, I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a little badly told at times. But Darkheart, while very very dark, is a convincing enough form of changing villain, and Hadley Kay did a fantastic job giving him expression. Talking about the voice didn't work, it was great, nothing wrong with it at all. The animation is colorful, and some of the images were especially breathtaking at first. The songs and scores are lovely, especially growing up and forever young, the latter has always been my personal favorite of the two. The care camps that I like are cute, and the human children are also well done. And the end is a real tower chopper. All in all, harmless fun fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
