let me say that I love Adam Sandler, looking at reigning over me, and I was very aware of his acting <br /> <br /> when he raises his voice, I can't help but think of happy gilmore shouting on a golf ball, so I snap back when Adam Sandler sucks me in. <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that comes slowly in the beginning with expectations of emotions in every scene. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a good job and is no exception here with some really good lines and is worth an Oscar in any movie he does. Adam Sandler was amazing in so many ways, not only was this his most dramatic / best film from his career. but I remember laughing a lot at many parts of this movie <br /> <br /> The support shot was also good with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie it has got great plays by NYC big comedy big drama And a new found respect for Adam Sandler if you ever doubted him or an assurance of how great Don Cheadle is
