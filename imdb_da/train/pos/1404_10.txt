HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror movies in the last decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. Special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon again proves that he can handle any role that comes his way. Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, well now Kevin Bacon has shocked us * with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The action is intense and the chills are true. You can actually find yourself if you see it in the dark on a stormy night. Support includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg, and Mary Randle. All of them do an unusual job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret of making anyone invisible. After animal testing, they proceed to human testing. But someone should be the subject. Volenteering, Caine is turned invisible. But when his team is unable to get back to visibility, Caine is driven by his state as he seeks his revenge ... * End spoilers * <br /> <br /> The movie has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic good into the next century. If the basis for a spoof forest in the SCARY MOVIE 2, this film takes you in the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most acts and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks to a crazy invisible man. And then change the water in the fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
