When I first saw this show, I thought it was so interesting. I saw it, so how about Sarah, as the sign sees the world ... revolving around her. I got it, but wasn't much laugh. <br /> <br /> Onstage and in her show she is racist, raw, insensitive and hugely self-centered. I didn't get her first and took it all at face value. Then I came to see his movie, Jesus is Magic. I think it worked as a Sarah Silverman primer for me and explained to me just what "language" she is talking about. She is like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to give us a face of horrible ideas and images, but ultimately realize it's not an attack, it's a statement. And when you understand it, you'll find it happy that somebody finally gives it to you. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to suggest that only smart people will understand or that hating this show is proving your idiocy. While I like many "smart" shows, I still don't see this day in the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that it's good, but I just don't understand. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but with songs or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not put together anything to fill a time and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to get the best show they can put together. If I were to predict the future of this show, I would say it will pave the way for arrested development and freaks & geeks. It will be canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on DVD. But take heart, SSP creators, your audience is out there and we'll see as long as they let you do the show.
