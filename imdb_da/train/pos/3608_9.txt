Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best is those who focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great live debut for Karyn Kusama, and an excellent first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and involved, it is enough to make it a memorable movie. The plot is strait ahead enough. Diana Guzman is in her fourth year in high school, but because of her picking battles in the hall she is close to expulsion. As a possible means of releasing her anger, she joins Boxing lessons in the club, where her brother trains (according to the father's wishes). In ninety minutes, we see viewers seeing something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club is attracted to her and she enters it. There is not a bad scene or a slack / glare moment in the movie. The only fault I would say could be corrected is that one of the part plates ends with what feels like an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
