Looking at how the two brothers interact and feed each other throughout the film, I personally like to live in the countryside, just as they did in the movie. I've seen this movie countless times and have the book right next to my Bible. Having seen the movie, I agree that this is one of the few films that make a book fair. I highly recommend anyone who has the chance to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do so. It is fantastic. I can't think of anyone else who could play the role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice and see one of the better movies in the modern film age. Highly recommended and as a guide to fishing trips in both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish from the stage in the movie, because although it looks good on the movie, you have no idea how much practice and skill there is fisherman actually takes. Thanks for listening Watch this movie, please if you want a long sad movie.
