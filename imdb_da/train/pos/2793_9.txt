It is such a shame that because of its title, this movie will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it as Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports girl. The storyline is touching and intelligent without being fussy, the jokes laugh a lot of fun, and the characters work well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting great performances on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's anxious father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly sorry for 'Ride with the Devil', comes across virtually the cozy guy for once and takes full advantage of his beautiful Irish accent ! Even if you don't like football, watch this movie. If that is something, it makes you smile.
