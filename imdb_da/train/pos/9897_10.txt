Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies because you can't see many like this one more! I would like to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off or a cheesy imitation, what does it imitate? I've never seen another movie like this, yes, not horrible. In essence, it is about the popular group in school who likes to get everyone's life to hell, so they decided to choose this nerdy boy named Marty. It becomes deadly when he is really hurt by one of their little pranks. So, like 10 years later, the group of friends who have hurt Marty are starting to get High School reunion letters. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! Then they return to the old school and one by one is turned off ....... Yes, you probably know what happens! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the very end. It could have been off or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try it and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
