This is a classic British comedy thriller I had always wanted to check out, but there was no opportunity for it so far. It is based on a popular stage game that has already been filmed several times before (especially in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); for the resumption during review, the plot has been updated to the current war situation. <br /> In any case, I was mostly acquainted with early British comedians through Will Hay's movie: considering that this has a similar plot of legendary haunts, smuggling and enemy agents, it is much in that vein. (it was actually written by the court's regular writing team of Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); The strict traveler element was then an equally tried and true formula. The star this time is Arthur Askey (anchored by Richard Murdoch) - none of the movies I had seen before - who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality turns out to be as potentially annoying ... but soon warms up to him, and Askey certainly comes up with a series of witty lines and entertaining business pages to justify the fact that the main character of the playtime (and the 1931 movie version) was divided into two here, where Murdoch acts as the star's equal partner. The remote single setting (movie events take place largely during a stormy evening) allows for a wonderful atmosphere; The last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is particularly gripping and well-handled. Also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion, and who is driven by all the excitement of taking her very first drink.
