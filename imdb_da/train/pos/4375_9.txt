Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacularly complete movie, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is a little less polished, but a better movie by far. This is a historical movie that combines timeless themes with truly historic values, while Braveheart puts a rough and unpleasant comtemporary glory on an ancient story. What makes this movie is cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprized (in a watered down way) in the Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. Comfortable but still, he orders the screen. Against him is a selection of equally human opponents, including Tim Roths Cunningham, unpleasant but brilliant, and John Hurt's moral bankruptcy. Also to praise is Jessica Lange, as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine who is only as it should be. This is not the most original movie you want to see, but it has the courage for its own beliefs and the strong ideas make you comfortable.
