Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short and because it is, the movie suffers. It could have been about fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> As I grew up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, wife with the cheating man, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great-acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here she is a beautiful young ingenuity that plays the title role. Julia answers an ad to a secretary and is immediately hired by Mrs Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - even if we learn immediately - that the recruiting agent is a front that is created to get the right woman for this task, a woman without a family and no girlfriend. <br /> <br /> When Julia comes to the house, she is in a dreary situation, and when she wakes up, she says she is Mrs Hughes and cannot go. <br /> <br /> The action is very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, especially at the end, happen too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.
