Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. This time, instead of the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than living nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal issues of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) riding a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his alienated, wounded brother, is still full of the unique and original visual dream images (some pretty striking air photographs of the heart filmed by veteran film photographer Freddy Francis) to make it an indisputable Lynch effort and characterization, some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic but fun way that allows the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns to some of her finest work in a minor role as his mentally challenged yet attentive daughter (whose painful secret is sharply revealed through a gentle walk in John Roach and Mary Sweeney's sensitive scripts), but the rest of the little throw to a person provides indelible performances, one of the most notable Barbara Barbara. whose accidental killing of a deer is both monstrous and sad at the same time. But it's vintage Lynch with its ability to engage and disturb you at his best. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or know him only of his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to start; For those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.
