I go on a limb and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good clip-show episode that killed in Commander William Thomas Riker's life and death struggle that fought for a terminally fatal disease. The scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the atmosphere Riker was in, such as when he relived his romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments were highlighted as Tasha's death in "the skin of evil" as well as elements of pulsating danger in the "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the above-mentioned "Skin of Evil". Riker also exhibited under fire by telling some humorous jokes like "One my ancestor was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of intense pain the snake died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological trial under extreme coercion. And yes, I am biased in my opinion to proclaim "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its initial aeration my face was covered with sweat and wondered if Riker would trigger the living and live to see others fantastic, galactic, outerspace adventure beyond the last limit ... Of course, in the years to come, I seem to have created a unique opinion on this episode ... but if a prize goes to "the best clip-show episode in TV story, "I think this episode should be highly regarded in this respect.
