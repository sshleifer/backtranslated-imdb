As a Pokémon fan, I have seen this movie very much. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationship between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this includes most adults). Some of the lines were corny, but it may be inevitable when you copy the movie into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were a few parts that didn't look so good. And although the villain is cute, I think the movies have done a good job of cycling through various types of villains, and I guarantee you that they are not all like this. Those who didn't like it, I say to each one of their own, but Pokémon fans will love it.
