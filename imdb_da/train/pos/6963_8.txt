A big surprise, probably because I was expecting to suck. The reviews were pretty dismissive of it, though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man finds out that his new boyfriend is a superhero and finds out that he will break up with her that she is some kind of psycho. I expect it to fall apart, but it never did. Sure, it doesn't make much of its amazing premise as it could, and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe. But I can't blame it for that. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And after many years, I have discovered that Luke Wilson can be perfect when he is thrown like a schlub. He's got two of the best comics in 2006 (the other in the pretty much released idiocrics). I have totally blown up his face when he and Thurman first have sex. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too much of a psycho, almost unbelievable. Maybe with a little background I could have accepted it better. However, I can forgive her mistakes because I had a really good time seeing it. Underestimated, for sure.
