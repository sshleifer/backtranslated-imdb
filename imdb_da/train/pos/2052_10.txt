I don't have much to add to my overview, this movie is right up there with Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made while not trying to be. I don't think it should be taken seriously when it is seen as very fun. <br /> <br /> I don't think it brings Christopher Walken's reputation down either as his reputation had returned yet. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the sleep he had been in. As for Michael Ironside, he has been in some of the great fun while not trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is great is the budget this movie had. The scenes and actors and explosions, etc. are quite amazing, so of course someone liked it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Who he or she was, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this for information about McBain (and I doubt seriously, there will be too many) just know it's a hilarious movie and should be seen with a smile on your face!
