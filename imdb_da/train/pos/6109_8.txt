My Tutor Friend is a well-written romance comedy movie that has something like My Sassy Girl .. there are no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always necessary in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie. I like the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon struck Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan to another girl and he will soon be the father. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, bringing smile to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao point: 8/10
