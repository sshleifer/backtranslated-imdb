Do you think you've had it hard? You should check this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a fleet diver should be an inspiration to all of us. And as I watched this movie, I learned that what appears is not even half that! Cuba Gooding, Jr. Do some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro is, as usual, good as the southern redneck, who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major move (after "Soul Food") has made a quantum leap as the film maker. If you want to be moved and inspired, definitely check this.
