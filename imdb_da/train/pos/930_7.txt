I'm sure most people already know the story - the miserable Ebenezer Scrooge visits three spirits (the ghosts of Christmas, present and yet) that highlight parts of his life hoping to save his soul and change his ways. Dickens' classic story in some form has been the time trial to become a beloved vacation favorite. <br /> <br /> As I grew up seeing the 1951 version with Alastair Sims, and I think he's the final Scrooge, I've been impressed with this version that was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and average Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors playing the ghosts are quite scary and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern movie footage (for the 1980s), which makes it more tasty for my kids than the 1951 black and white version. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one I see almost every year at a time of Christmas.
