Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film depicting how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the influence each society has on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in China produce beads that cost a little for nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks the Americans where these pearls come from, they had no idea and seemed foolishly founded. When he told them that they were made in China for less than nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, sore and a little annoyed, but did not seem to stop buying the gems after finding out the truth . When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans had them over their neck and paid so much for those pearls. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind the pearls and couldn't believe it. This film is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
