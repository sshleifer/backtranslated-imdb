Jim McKay has made one of the best movies you'll see all year round. The silent simplicity of this movie draws you from the opening shot and never lets go. There is not a false note throughout the film. None. Everything works. The hand camera is never distracting and always where it should be. The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always right. There is not a single blow where the audience has been reminded that we are watching actresses that play a role. These are just real girls trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. It's cinema at its most basic, and although it will only be seen by a handful of movie guests, it deserves a much wider release. special hats for Hugh Hefner to give the filmmakers the necessary money to make this important movie. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay next time.
