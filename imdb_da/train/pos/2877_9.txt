I don't think I'll tell you the story. Because it has been told this year and year. So I just want to share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney kid in a good way. The animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but it is part of its charm now. Now in the age of High School Musical and computer-generated images, people seem to have forgotten the brilliance and magic of the early Disney movies. Luckily, I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it doesn't matter how old I get, I return to the five-year-old and see it on VHS. Which is Disney's true magic.
