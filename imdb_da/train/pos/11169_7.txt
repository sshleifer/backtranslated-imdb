when i saw the movie in the beginning i thought it was boring because nothing happened, but since all the scary things started to happen when the church dies and is brought back to life, and also gage and his mother die and there idiot father bring them back to life, even though he sighs the warnings and ignores Jud. This is not Stevens kings best work. I thought his best work was shining. I don't think people who watch this movie and comment on how terrible it was are wrong because all they believe is what they thought. As if the person can do a better job of making a scare. I mean to do gage hurt and how he kills Jud's genius. Making the most innocent most unsuspecting sign of one of the guys is cool. People who didn't like the movie are stupid because it's all a scary movie and nothing. Don't expect anything from a movie it isn't. It was still in a general area not so good. I still recommend people to watch the movie
