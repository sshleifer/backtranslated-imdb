A river runs through It is based on the true story of two fly fishermen's brothers, Norman and Paul, (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose ruling father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing. And for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progress of the brothers' lives and how their lives are separated on two different paths. It's a touching movie told by director Robert Redford, playing the older Norman and reflecting in times gone by and people are dead. <br /> <br /> Some themes resume in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes are about Paul's almost tragic hero. He is a talented, charming and courageous man, but has his fatal mistakes. <br /> <br /> The final lines summarize the "point" of the movie: "Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence falls to a being with my soul and memories and the sound of the Big Blackfoot River and a four rhythm And hoping that a fish will rise, eventually all things go together in one, and a river runs through it, the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of the time, some of which are timeless raindrops. The rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by water. "
