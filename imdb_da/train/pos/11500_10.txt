If Mulder was looking for his real father here, he is Darren McGavin, the first X files, a shame, it was only a season, the producers of this show did not know that they had a classic power on their hands and in 1993 together came Chris Carter with what I call the follow-up to Night Stalker, The X Files. Both will go down as classics is my opinion the two show that viewers get an experience level that only comes together once and who will appear in X Files years later Darren McGavin, as agent Arthur Dales helps our two favorite hero's issues about the solution . Greetings to the man I think, well done, Chris Carter to bring back a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin, if it wasn't to see The X files and the special show I never wanted known at night pursuing.
