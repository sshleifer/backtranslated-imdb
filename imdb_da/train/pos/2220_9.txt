We tend to forget that the master / slave context of the past centuries leads to more than well-groomed properties, driven by large groups of slavery and a lot of money for the white owners. It leads to a group of people trapped in the middle - descendants of the slave owners who disturb their female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became more slaves, and others were free ... but free and colored, meanwhile anything but their many. <br /> <br /> A class formed around these offspring's couleur libre or free people in color - and that class could, to some extent, own properties, shift from despair to educated and achieve comparative dignity. That is, they were not slaves, but they were still used to some extent. <br /> <br /> Often, women lived as mistresses to the white planters and wealthy men created in their own homes, supplemented, schooled for their children, and some kind of gentleness, depending on the respectability they chose to impose on their families. In essence, they prostitute themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from work - an event called pla√ßage. <br /> <br /> Every sacred celebration is a beautifully written story about the children of such a woman, the result of just such an event with a local gentleman and the people who touched their lives, both negatively and positively. The story was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, without any real perception of the black and white lines, let alone the gray area in the middle, where once the couleur libre believed gingerly. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and have been well reproduced in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. Parts are well-groomed, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn, the blurry areas become more evident by the conflicts that the protagonists go through. Gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic, could not bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they were dependent on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, unreservedly. If you cannot handle the truth, you will cringe and hug through some parts that an injustice after another is met by the colors, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. Remember, however, that this is no more than reality, and this narrative is an absorbing way to learn about it. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound cold, but these miniseries both entertained me and penetrated me despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what was happening and I thoroughly enjoyed it. See it. If not read during the period, because there is a lesson to learn from it all.
