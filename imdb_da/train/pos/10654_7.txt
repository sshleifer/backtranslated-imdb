The Haunting is a movie that boasts a truly creepy house, good work effects and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the scary aspects of what was happening at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really scary moments in the movie, and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right mood, and the sound design had voices that appeared around you. What I could want could have been, for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with, and I think he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me stupidly when I saw it many years ago and it still holds. Haunting could have used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimatic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The action is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wanted it scared me more.
