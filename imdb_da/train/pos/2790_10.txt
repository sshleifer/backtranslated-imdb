Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle and exciting comedy in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> Like the airplanes that are constantly arriving and departing from overhead, we follow ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) as they discover an unlikely friendship centering on their common passion for football and their technical betrayal with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy grows out of the misconceptions of these two talented girls' families as they break all expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds. Somewhere in the middle, as mediator, peace-maker and frightened athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team console for Hounslow Harriers - intercedes in times of crisis while at the same time the main sensation of love by both protagonists. Lastly, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the road, we finally see our dedicated and beloved football heroines floating away to realize their dreams. With great performances by Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs. Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Paxton) and Frank Harper (Paxton) this is truly a movie that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are battling for their own battles, yet contributing much to our understanding of the protagonists of the movie. In its own special way, this film tells an important story, which in completely random football. It celebrates evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the native ability of young people to teach the old.
