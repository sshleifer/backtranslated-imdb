Otto Preminger, who conducted a noir cycle on Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his "Laura" leaders to this rigorous, gritty detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a policeman, but this time he's hardened, cynical, and accused of police brutality by his superior - "You don't hate caps, you like to beat them up!". Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals when his own father was a villain. He does not want to be "Sandy Dixon's child", so he became a policeman, but his methods are hard and hated. <br /> <br /> One night investigating a murder, he unknowingly slaughtered a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that it kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up and intends to hit a hated scare, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, blame falls on Paina's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, Model Morgan Taylor's (Tierney) department store is abandoned by her husband, but is still being drawn into his playing arrangements. Paine had beaten his wife and raged her father, who appeared with his son-in-law, but not before Dixon had gone with the body. Without a better suspect, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Riddled with blame, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money to a lawyer. He decides to take Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. Finally, he cannot live with knowledge with what he has done, and he allows the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan regrets his love for Mark and wants to wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after so many years of television disturbance. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, gives the comment and does a good job, but I find his claim that the audience would not have captured the meaning of the casting of the two leaders when "Laura" had been made six years earlier. In that regard, he fails because they had come in "Iron Curtain" two years prior to WTSE, and the movie was a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were great together, and Ruth Donnelly is a great comic relief as a restaurant owner Martha flames the flames between detective and lady. <br /> <br /> Night cityscapes give the movie an air of threat. Gary Merrill is great as the low-season scale, which had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("your father liked me," he takes Markus). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are also fantastic. And Tom Tully is just touching and fun as Morgan's unfairly accused pop. A watchable movie noir with a fantastic cast.
