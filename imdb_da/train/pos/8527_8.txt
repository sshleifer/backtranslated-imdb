Let me just get to the bottom here: I have 3 children aged 5 to 10. I consider a trip to the theater to be a success when there are no talk animals. I've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie returns in The Wizard of Oz, the over 18 sexual joke in El Dorado and the tragic mistake with the end of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could probably tell the story Nemo from memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my one child (it varies), suggesting this title for the family movie in the evening? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
