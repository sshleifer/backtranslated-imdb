"Plainsman" represents Cecil B. DeMil's direct-oriented highly inaccurate and inaccurate. It sets up parallel plots for no less star play than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, though Lincoln was in fact already dead at the time of the story. DeMille occasionally flies dangerously close to the truth, but just as easily weighs away from it for immaculate plays and showmanship. The film is an attempt to combat Custer's last stand with a fictional bond solely based on human life, already made from manufactured things and legends. This is truly the world according to DeMille - a pastor in the annals of entertainment, but a beautiful campy relic according to today's standards. TRANSFER: Considering the movie's vintage, this is a moderately pleasing transfer, with often pure white and extremely solid blacks. There is a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the picture quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good ?? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The sound is mono but nicely balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRA: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As a pseudo-story painted on celluloid, this is Western convincing and fun. Just take their characters and history with a grain of salt ?? in some cases ?? a whole box seems more appropriate!
