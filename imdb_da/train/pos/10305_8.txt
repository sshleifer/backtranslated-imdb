If you want a serious grin, watch this movie and the things Bruce infects on his colleague's news machine. The deleted scenes are invaluable. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It may not be due to time since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!
