I love old Burt Reynolds movie. They are more fun and better than any other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess how could they have known there wouldn't be more good? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds is going to dress like a chicken and drive around in a carriage lot, and the lush Loni Anderson is on her hand and looks extremely hot in the 80s. Burt and Loni, it was the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in advertising a vacuum cleaner. I certainly loved the ad! In addition, there is one part in the film, where the audience at the railway station is concerned about something that Stroker Ace (Burty R.) does, and it shows that a guy in the audience sucks and sticks his finger up to get his disappointment! I laughed so hard that I almost walked away in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never see another movie again, because I tell you right now: There is no point.
