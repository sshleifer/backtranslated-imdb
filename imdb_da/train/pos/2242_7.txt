Partly from the perceived need, it feels to involve a conventional love story in the plot to make the movie more manageable to a 1950s movie actor. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some vicious characteristics of the upper-class bureaucrats running the foreign ministry --- the British are pilloried in the way that only the British can pile themselves. But after that, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. Terry-Thomas can be seen as always, but the great talent of the cast (Peter Sellers, et al.) Is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A red tape but not a good movie.
