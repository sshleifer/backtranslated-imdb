White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First Nations + Nature + Animals = GOD. Simple formula. In fact, the same forms of propaganda in recent days were used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attacking it. But I say that the film succeeds in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and originality in a way that appeals to everyone. You must not doubt the film's rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won is lost. But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains. (The movie also equates to the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
