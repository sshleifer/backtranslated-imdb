Ed Harris's work in this movie is up to his usual standard of expertise, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and it includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than fair, comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the lawyer for another convicted person. It is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all skilled and Connery is reliable, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself packs no wallop. The reason depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner is always mistreated and taken by white law enforcement authorities. This is the engine that drives the story right or wrong, and makes you feel a bit cheated in the end. <br /> <br /> Still worth seeing to see Harris in action.
