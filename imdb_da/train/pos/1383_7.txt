The original title means "The Birth of the Octopus". I must admit that I do not fully understand this title. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read the comment from another user: "The title of French is also suggestive:" Prieuve or squid, suggests a person to juggle many prints simultaneously. " Thank you for your explanation. The basic theme is the girls' first sexual feelings when it is not clear whether they are aimed at the same or the other sex. It's no different for boys. I think that both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any mix. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is the water ball. Sometimes the girls will have their heads down and nothing over the water except their feet and lower their legs as they will wave and kick in the air. To people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she wants to see when Floriane is training. This seems to be their first contact that is not just common. Soon they will go together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes with him for an hour while Marie is waiting for her to return. I took for granted that the couple slept with each other. But we later learn from the film that they are doing less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that few users will find elsewhere. There is a scene where Marie steals the star Florianes garbage can. In it she finds an apple that is mostly eaten. And Marie continues to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another movie, "Kazetachi no gogo" by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). It is about adult young women, and a clear lesbian woman is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a Sunday bag from the beloved, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriane Marie tells her that she wants her first orgasm from her. Marie says she can't do this. <br /> <br /> But later, Marie says she is actually willing to do so. And she masturbates at Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a female instructor could have made such a good psychological show or study of ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Ad√®le Haenel, who made the outstanding performance of the autistic girl in "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? a very underrated movie.
