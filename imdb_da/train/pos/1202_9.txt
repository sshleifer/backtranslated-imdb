I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to pitch "The Dawn". Have a good look at how outsiders are trying to get in to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was composed well and organized in an interesting way that made the movie flow good. Definitely worth a watch. My only complaint is that they seemed to be no closure. Maybe it's part of the point. We expect it, but in reality it is not what happened (or usually happens). The movie is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality next to their Canadian TV show. You can see some of what is yet to come. <br /> <br /> I look forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase.
