To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it. This is how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought it was a movie about stoners in the woods or something. I had something wrong. <br /> <br /> Loaded was a bit boring at first, but once it started getting started, it was really good for me. I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but doing things that you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was silly and unreliable, but I ask to be different. These kinds of things happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "unlikely". Really sorry, but the reality in the world is that they happen. The creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things get well, sometimes they get bad, and that's life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
