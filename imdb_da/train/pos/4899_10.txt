I'm so glad I happened to see this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this turned out to be a real gem. I loved that the movie, a love story of some sort, was not about some beautiful twenty-somethings; It is rather a story of some beautiful fifty somethings that used to be twenty somethings. It is a good, well-written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous second world band music thrown in. It also has a wonderful surprise for the Scottish castle lovers. It left me smiling and ready to see it again, which I did a few times before I hit it. I highly recommend it.
