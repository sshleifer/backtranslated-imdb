"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the movie can be translated into English as the "sword carrier". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an extraordinary ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that comes under the skin in his hand. On the first page, he may seem like a more foolish superhero from the pointless movie about unreal events and emotions. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called anti-hero. I think he is just a person who lost his claim in his life and believe in good, fairness and love. In his life he never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Each of his steps is colored with blood; He takes revenge on everyone for his gift, which became a curse for him. And suddenly he meets her. She does not need inactive lectures and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She doesn't care what he did. That he is next to her is more important than anything else. But soon she finds her secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. Even after that she could not escape her feelings. They try to run, but it's hard to hide. Finally, they have a serious car accident. He is caged; she is in a mental hospital. They don't know each other, but she thinks he'll save her. He monitors many obstacles, but finally finds her. They run again, but they are not harmless. She is hurt, she needs rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they go into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopters around them, but there is no need for it because she is already dead in his arms and he is the one lonely person all over the world again.
