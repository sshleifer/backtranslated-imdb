Have no illusions, it's a moral story. Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains once more by kill-crazed Taylor. Granger can see that the end is near and feels deep for the cost of the hunt for the crews, the Indians and the country itself. On the other hand, Taylor responds to killing buffalo or Indians to be with a woman. While Granger's role as the tortured hunter is fantastic, it is Taylor who steals the show as the demented, immoral 'everyman' off the fast buck and goodies. There is not much bang-bang here, but the story goes on fast, and we are treated to a fine character performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is as exciting today as in the 19th century man's relationship with the earth and what is on it, and racism. Considering when this was made, the censors must have twisted their hankens under the scenes in "bawdy house", Taylor's relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue. Although downbeat, this is really a great western image.
