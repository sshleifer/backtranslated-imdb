This movie is one of the "WOW!" movie. Not because it's the biggest movie all the time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was at Elvis. I can safely say so many imitators as there is only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came very close to being the right thing. It was one of the greatest imitations I've ever seen. He had me believe it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis' life from watching this movie. And didn't share the part of the TV so you can stray - it's really a great movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis' twin :)
