A patchwork of 911. The 11 stories from 11 leaders from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to the Americans "we have had more deaths than you and you supported the killers ", sometimes really weird (but very symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New York showing that our daily problems are not important), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strong anti-war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (fun, typical African optimism despite horrible day-to-day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace who has moral difficulties accepting US policy towards Arab countries). I'm really happy to see many Americans like this movie. It shows that we (or those I am still Belgian but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and able to question past and present actions of our government that we should be in democracy .
