Having seen this movie strictly on the basis of the reviewers' reviews, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although it is clearly low budget, it carries signs of smart ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I thought to myself that her sense of isolation would be reinforced with an external shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And look and see! The next scene was just the last shot of the house that stood alone on the cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how a smart instructor can raise his movie to the level of a very enjoyable thriller. Savvy viewers will surely see them, but they must be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performances, George Macready is his usual creepy self who almost never maintains his peace while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the no-nonsense working girl who is not sending without a fight. But Dame May Witty, Oh, I had my own doubts about myself and thought she could get away with her evil schemes. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.
