Because of the invention of a "The Domestication Collar", carnivorous zombies become under control and become productive members of society; But they do menial tasks. The servant dead participates in those who live in fenced US 1950s small towns, while uncovered zombies roam the "The Wild Zone". In the city "Willard" live pre-teen K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) along with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Akas, Robinsons is the only family on their street who does not own a zombie; their new neighbors, bottom, have six. So to quit Robinson's Zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connol's "Domestication Collar" damaged by an old lady walker and he eats her; Then, new and hungry zombies attack the city. Meanwhile, Young Ray has been tied to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like Timmy's and Lassie's), and the Robinson family finds it difficult to work with the controlling "Zomcom" authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" doesn't go far enough to its own exciting "Wild Zone"; but it is a colorful, stylish and fun satirical addition to zombie movie lore. Ray and the cast work well, individually; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (like Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (like Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and crew including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design) won deserved awards. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
