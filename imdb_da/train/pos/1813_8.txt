In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than expected. I think this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about the themes even after I finished. It speaks of death, revenge and hell in such a way that it comes to you as a blow in your face, even when you are going to suffer with the dream sequence in the middle of the movie. That's what makes this movie so good: The ability of Don Bluth (instructor) to play with people's emotions and make them love or hate a character in no time. It and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy end you should say "I have something in my eye" to hide the others as you cried. All I have said is just some of the good points in this movie. As for the rest, you see them in a movie that is very honest. Don Bluth, please.
