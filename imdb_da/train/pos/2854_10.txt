Much has already been said about this movie and I would like to be with those who praised it. It is an extremely unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh loudly, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and mistakes you see. Sabu's genius can be seen with regard to some sequences of the film. One is what all three men are chasing each other, have an erotic daydream about a young woman who they just walked on the street. This order is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It's erotic and fun at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is that part of the movie where the runners get tired. First, one of them, the typical loser among the three guys hallucinating, that the woman who left him for another is back again and you see them dancing with each other and in the next shot he dances with himself which is deeply moving. All runners come to this point where they think to have something left they lost or are on their way again. And in one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing. So here's the whole beauty and ridicule of what we call life, as Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they end?), But he does not rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues", right to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go see them! <br /> <br />
