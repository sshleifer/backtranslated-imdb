I was in a bad state of mind when I first saw this movie. For some reason it clicks on all my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness, and the desire to share your life. It didn't hurt that the person sharing your life was a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the audio track for this movie (very hard to get). Loved it and hope it will one day come out on DV
