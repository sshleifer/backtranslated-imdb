Yes, Keaton looks like he really likes to make this movie. With a ship in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits, he reminds Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young cap that only does it to pay for his mother's high medical bills and sends her younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to the law school. After all, nobody knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerous until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & doesn't like Johnny a bit (and I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a good song / dance routine while Johnny enjoys it. I love that part when they are in the ever changing escape car! The police who "call all cars" are the skipper of Gilligan's Island! Watch this for the 1930s gangster laughing! Gags in this movie are funny, but you have to catch them or you will miss them! Look in the background of each scene.
