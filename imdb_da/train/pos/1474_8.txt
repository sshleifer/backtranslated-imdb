I watched this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as sweet as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary film (every episode is 50 minutes) with the Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality, imagination, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, the multifunctional Fiennes clan (she is the sister of the actors Ralph and Joseph). I enjoyed it quite a bit, though I think it will be even more fun on DVD, as there is such a tip of ideas to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian analyzes can be quite heavy, and seeing the entire series at one time became a little disoriented at the end of two and a half hours. It didn't help that a creepy coffee and possession of a bladder led me to any discomfort in the last hour or so. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that Zizek picked movies that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends quite a bit of time on movies from Hitchcock and David Lynch, not even masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider selection of movies, although it really is me who says I would like to see part four and five and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is a lot of fun, and part of the humor was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while he was in the actual scenes of some of the films he was discussing. So, for example, we see him in a motor boat heading to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). It is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I disagreed with him, it certainly made me a little more deep about the movies. That's exactly what he's trying to achieve.
