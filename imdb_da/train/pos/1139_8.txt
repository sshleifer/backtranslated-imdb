There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character comes close to flawless. This is sooo fun !! And it has a lot of satire there. Sally Field is moving into truly outstanding actors and doing a good, if not perfect, job with her daily television diva. Sometimes her acting is just a little to wide and over the top, but 90% of the time she's a riot! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately have too little to do here). Downey Jr. must not completely convince himself as a comedian and does not have the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part, which to be honest is the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch if ever there was one with more than one nasty secret (you'll see in the absolutely amazing finale!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. I usually like Ms Shue, but here she works like a fish out of water and seems to be in another movie. But it is not harmful, and for the most part she is at least adequate. Otherwise, it's a comedy to watch when it's on TV or anywhere.
