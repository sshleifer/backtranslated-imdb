A SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short Subject. <br /> <br /> It can get really hard on Kärnemälk Pete's Cafe when the local readiness of ink-clad WAR BABIES enters their dinner break. <br /> <br /> This primitive little movie - a spear of military film - gives a couple of chuckles, but a little bit different: small tots speak hard can begin to pile in no time. Shirley Temple, which plays a duplicate hip-swinging French miss, doesn't have much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlight: The real signs of toddler temperament when a couple of infants unexpectedly get well and really soaked with milk. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, the two and two reel's short designs were useful for studios as important training places for new or emerging talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was quite different from that of a movie of its own length, something like writing a topnotch story rather than a novel. Economically producing in terms of both budget and schedule and able to depict a wide range of materials, short motifs were the perfect complement to the study's feature film.
