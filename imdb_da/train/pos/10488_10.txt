After his Oscar nominated tour of "Secrets & Lies", Brenda played Blethyn in the equally big "Save Grace". And let me tell you, it's not the kind of movie you find every day. After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that his irresponsible economic decisions have left her with a massive debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace begins to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie was played to great effect; There is not a dull moment anywhere in it. And I surely did not see the conclusion scene coming! But you still have to watch this movie. You can just feel more than a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else, it can serve as a good lesson to know its economy. But of course there is much more than that!
