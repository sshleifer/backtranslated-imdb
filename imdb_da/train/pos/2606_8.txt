Maybe some people might consider this a slow movie. But it is precisely this "slow burning" that makes it possible to influence the viewer deeply. Like the wonderful first scene: First, we can hear the voices; then we are allowed to see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly pans back and forth, and we see another sign, a young man just sitting there, apparently not even listening to the conversation or at least not really caring. The fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the film's strategy: that the character can be developed and determined by the surroundings around him, but without noticing the points more than necessary. People come and go, float in and out of their lives. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the supporting characters are seen only when he is close to him, defined in relation to the relationship maintained with him), we are introduced to believe that we are objective so subtle is the director's touch.
