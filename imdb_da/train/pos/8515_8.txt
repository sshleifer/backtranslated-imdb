The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, which I like from previous movies. The movie was a great family movie, nothing that would worry you about showing it to younger kids, a good story line, lots of laughs, ease and enjoyable. If you want to entertain children without being bored with tears, this fits the bill. Kid comfortable and not hard for a parent to see either.
