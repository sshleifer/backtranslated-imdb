I originally saw this very dark comedy about 2000 or so on cable TV. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is hidden armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" don (remember New York Don, who was supposed to be the schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their most beautiful and NOT to be played with! Thus prove that beauty and toughness go together! Then there's the big "bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play the world "bullshit". This film is both subtle and bald. For all recordings it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see more players in their final or almost final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of word games and moves you without breaking everything in sight, it's the movie for you. Roger Ebert dumps this movie. He's flat wrong. THIS is a nice, nice movie! Maybe just not one for Ebert. I consider it a 10 because of how well it is done and how fun the script can be, while not really a straight comedy kind of movie. I like it so well that I bought it on DVD because it just doesn't show much on cable TV. Now it's all mine!
