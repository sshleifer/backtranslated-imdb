Another silent love triangle movie from Hitchcock, not a mystery but much English, works well and photographed. The smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the beautiful but unimaginable Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are lots of character actors and grotesques in Jack and Mabel's wedding, where the guardian is in the corridor, registering shocks in the eyes of the very tall and very short men, the fat lady, the bound twins, of course arguing which side of the time sit and the wedding party is entertaining. The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart or something. It was another era all together with the audience in evening dress, and the boxers also beat up when they were out of the ring. The camera's angles, the pace, the use of symbols, the intersection are all very stylish and masterful. The camera work and editing of the last boxing match is very poignant. Brisson's good looks are well utilized in this one; His smile is not as ignorant of what is going on around him as he is in Hitchcock's The Manxman, nor is it annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?
