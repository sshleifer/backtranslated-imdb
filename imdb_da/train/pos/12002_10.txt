Despite having read the "first comments" from someone curiously disliked the movie - (WHY IS THE NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON LIST?) It was very nice to note that just about everyone else loved it! Of course, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way ~ that's the whole idea. And in fact, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but in spite of that, and all the terrible negative experiments touched by the adversary, it just showed how he could accomplish a remarkable, divine work. I would recommend it to anyone!
