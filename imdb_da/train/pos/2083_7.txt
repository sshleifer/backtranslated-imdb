This film was an interesting recording of Hollywood on the novel by the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think it is abundant of racest stereotypes, then the idea of ​​Chinese protagonists was progressive in itself. I found out that the white actors who played Chinese were not as bad as I had expected it was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. At that time there were not really any Asian players in America (not even George Takei had appeared) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It was not the greatest achievement I have ever seen, but for the old-school pre-method it worked out was nice. The carob scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression hurt this movie to an allegory. Particularly, political confusion confuses the peasant farmers and how they seem to be left behind by everything. <br /> <br /> The movie had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I also think the Eastern influence affects it. If this had been a Western family, Johns would have won at the end, punishing the peasant for his pride, desire, and gulf. But here he learns his lesson and then wins.
