This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the Ottoman Empire's last harem, well-told and provocative, we see the inner effects of a world now gone, learning about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the story, the characters, the plays and the scenes. A couple of scenes suffered from quick editing and the subtitles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece. The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain, who I am happy to say did a fantastic job beyond doing so. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovely. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they imitate.
