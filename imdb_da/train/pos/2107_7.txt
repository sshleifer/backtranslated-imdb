I recently purchased this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually I am in war and action movies, but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored with today's special FX movies and high gloss romantic comedies, check out the Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take e.g. Matuschek: When he finds out that his wife is cheating him with one of his own employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not just because of the humiliation, but because he has been unfair to the character of Stewart. (OK, woven example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the film's focus is narrow and the plot is predictable. But I liked it very much. If you like Notting Hill, you would like to shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot about Jimmy Stewart.
