My daughter is really pronounced on me when I refer to Drew Barrymore who looks like she had been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention his Dudley Dooright chin which Jay Leno would die for. How wonderful when I discovered in "Fever" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and jimmy fallon and the red sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be completely stereotypical, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and portrayal of sports craze. My sports-hating wife, my teenage daughter, and I found everyone something to like in the movie. It says something in itself. It is a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half, and that is probably a very good date.
