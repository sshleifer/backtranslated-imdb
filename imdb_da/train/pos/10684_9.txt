By seeing this early DeMille work, it was once again reinforced for me that the early DeMille is far better than late DeMille. His attention to the use of light within scenes is remarkable. His pacing is very good, which gives a lot to know about an hour or so. It is a pity that he was not so intuitive about the style of his later sound movie when he seemed to be in his silent movie. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, fairly well-maintained and yet conveyed a wide range of emotions. The end is wonderful.
