With this film, it is about style, atmosphere and acting. It was true, I didn't believe in all the plot developments, but it didn't matter - the amazing action, the unexpected plots, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and brought me along for the ride and I had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but an accent master, and he proves it again with a flawless Georgia accent. He is surrounded by so many talents to support roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz of Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall) that I was simply blown away. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I'm never tired of seeing it. Just one of the best thrillers of the year. If you have ignored this movie (and you have the chances) then I suggest you check it out.
