It was "The Night he came home", warned the posters of John Carpenter's career-making horror classic. Seen in a small American city, Halloween Centers around serial killer Michael Myers' attempt to track his sister Laurie Strode and in the process of eliminating all her friends in rather brutal ways ... leaving poor Laurie to fight the seemingly indestructible Michael . This plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs during the 80s, 90s, and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. The difference between them and this is simply that "Halloween" is the best. Made on a very modest, tight budget ... Halloween changed the face of the scream in 1978 and created the subgenre of "sexually promiscuous teens being stalked by a knife / ax / chainsaw / wielding psycho".
