If you, like me, have a very close and long relationship with Tintin's world .... do yourself a favor and see this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life-creating Tintin. I am so brilliant and a very cool production. The whole background story of Hergé and the people and also the many different situations he was influenced by, too good and worse is fantastic. There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comics and this. I will definitely be in my basement digging the Tintin albums again. The film itself is also told very well and has a great surrounding sound to it. I really hope people will find this as exciting as I did!
