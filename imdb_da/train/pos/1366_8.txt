am I the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus 'myth of sisyphus' and Mary's life? in the camus version, a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant bricks that he must roll up a hill. unfortunately every time he reaches the top, the basement slides and ends at the bottom to start. There may have been a buzzard looking at his eyes, I'm not sure right now. In the film, mary spends her life fighting to get her life together, unfortunately every time she gets a fall, she falls and loses everything. The point in point would be the party she throws, where she gets drunk, insults her falcon's teacher, and is almost attacked by liev schrieber. In case you ask this theory, note how this scene ends with her attempt to climb a flight of stars, while books fall from nowhere hinders her progress until eventually she passes. The next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs and never reached the top.
