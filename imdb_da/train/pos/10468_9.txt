Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From late night hosting with Penn and Teller to the one, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show held me back on Friday night in my high school years and gave some of the best drive-in memories always come out of the driveway. Without a doubt the best late night tv ever. If you didn't stop, you were missing out. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live on, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... did anyone else sit through all 4 hours "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> Long live Monstervision!
