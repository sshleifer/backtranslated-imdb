"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, splashes and stripping of clothes to jump from a yacht and swim. It all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) endless. Bonnie gets a job at a newspaper called Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The main man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays another villain. Later, of course, he wanted to be a romantic hero, but in the early 30s, MGM used him as a bad guy. Not aware that her brother is involved in illegal activity, Bonnie cozies up to Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford made a good team. Her facial expression is a bit on the wild side, but it is with her dance one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, Jiminy Crickets voice, as Bert. <br /> <br /> Watching precode movies is always interesting and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
