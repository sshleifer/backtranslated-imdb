First, this is an excellent series, even though we have a James Bond effect. What I think is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure in 007, Dr. No (1962) is the second, while in Golden Eye, the first movie with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male "M" so how could she have been in place at the start before Bond became a double-0, except that she is of course 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" excitement license. We need to turn our heads a little away if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie doesn't have any of the primitive electronics in the original series from nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantasy. (now we call them mobile phones) and there were sliding handles instead of buttons. OMG, do you think 400 years from now, would they have perfected Rogaine to Jean-Luc Picard? So let's give the producers some space. <br /> <br /> But to try to make things a bit consistent, let's just consider the Cylons creation only 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the cylons that populated the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous leaps through space. Well, what happened if a cyclone ship at war with the Caprica fleet was fired or there was a sunscreen or anything and a ship filled with human cylons not only ended by jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a curly ship near Earth One. They colonized it and found that they could rebuild it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they even sent out a "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopular planet which they colonized to become people who gradually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. What came first, the chicken or the road? So what? It's fraking entertaining!
