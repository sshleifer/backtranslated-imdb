Note: These comments are for people who have watched the movie. Vanilla Sky is an ingenious, complex and exciting film that existentially explores exactly what the tagline says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the movie plot can be the focus of confused movie walks if you look at it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now I have not carefully gone through the scene after the scene, so I have to further investigate my claims (and I welcome your thoughts), but try it and try to see if the film does not fall into place: Where does the debatable "splice" happen? <br /> <br /> Now I'm not talking about the splice as explained by LE 'technician, as the sequence itself could actually be interpreted as a rationalization inside David Aames mind / dream / coma state, but the real splice between reality and dream. It seems to me that the reality of the car collision is the way it is filmed on (eg no explosion) a probable split point and that a particular sequence containing an existential / dream / coma / non-reality feels to it - regardless whether it is shown on the screen before or after the crash - is actually part of Aames personal journey towards self-realization within his own mind. In this respect, we are so much back to two issues end (if you know more, let me know): Is Aames actually disinfected and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you are not completely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what time his dreams are scattered everywhere, this film becomes a fascinating exploration of a human being on a journey to find himself itself and what it means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
