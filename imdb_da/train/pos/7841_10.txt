This is really a treat for any Bolan fan, some might think it is a bit over the top and that it is only about Ringo and Marc's egos, but I think it looks like any other concert video, except that this is Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for the children of revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, i can't believe they didn't release this version as single. The movie is really amazing, especially for us fashion. Now I didn't live in the 70s. But Danes generally was completely shot out of what happened around them. The media did not play or showed any of the popular music, as Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a bit with The Doors, only the really popular songs. so I know from my father that when he sees this, he gives him some of his youth, he must never experience. <br /> <br /> I don't want to do it too long, so ... If you're the smallest fan of Marc Bolan, you'll see this. You might find it boring or, as I said before, a little over the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever started! <br /> <br /> Only things that disappoint me a bit are that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but I forgive it when Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderfully played.
