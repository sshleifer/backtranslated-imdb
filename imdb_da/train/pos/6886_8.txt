This is in contrast to any other movie, the closest I can compare to it is a Woody Allen movie ... But wherever Woody Allen constantly captures human foables, Bret Carr seems to find a way to grab it astonishing uncertainty that tends to define us for better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the reason for his tribe that can be traced back to a unique childhood trauma that is revealed through flashbacks. There are so many strange neurotic people in the world, and I think they all deserve a chance for redemption, although diversity of human nature is all that makes the world an exciting place, so maybe we should not correct our neurosis longer than we should fix our noses or chest. /> <br /> This is an indie film shot on a long shoestring, but the production values ​​are huge, like the size of the movie. I want to be a quirky gem for the self-help market. I'm really looking forward to seeing what this filmmaker is doing next, I could imagine a career like Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, but usually when a guy like this breaks out, he goes out and does "X MEN" and his humble decoration Origin is soon forgotten or are they .... X Men are a lot of freaks if I remember correctly :)
