If there were two more charming artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith shown together in a more charming movie in 1968, I don't know who they were. I first saw this lovely little satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I consider every year where I haven't settled down to see it again a waste. It is intelligent, quirky, neat, wistful, sweet, gently subversive and totally enchanting. The romance of these two social misfits is both really comical and horrible to move - never more than in Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to get the right card up in the deck, a scene that is both quite fun and a perfect miniature portrait of heartbreaking solitude. And the last freezing frame on the worried, worried, Ustinov's loving face, which he asks, "Are you okay?" - Has anyone ever made the look and sound of affection so perfect and nude honest? I would never like to know anyone good who didn't love this movie.
