Idiotic hack crooks, a child, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all up and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with some a-list star power (at least a-minus ... okay, b-plus?) this movie got very little publicity. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't diminish its genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some really classic lines and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not an emigrated "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are low-key guys. They speak low-powered Spanish language and they do alive stupid things. But they make it your entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
