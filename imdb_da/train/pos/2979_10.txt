There really isn't much to say about this movie .... it's raw but fun. <br /> <br /> Plot outline (From IMDB) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invent a new game to Play basketball, using baseball rules. When the game becomes a great success, together with a billionaire's help, they make up the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer's team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that stands in the way of major government changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to introduce. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good, as there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in this movie, I can't get close to naming them all. It never really looks like it and they are not trying to put any cruddy drama in to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It is well. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. Generally, a raw but extremely fun movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
