This movie is a should-be classic. It's not perfect, for sure. The pacings, while perfect for the stage, are slow in film form as an arthritic knee turtle. Jean Seberg is misdirected to being too sweet and gentle. She shows enough talents, skills and craftsmanship to convincingly play the clever, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director lacked character character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game has his dialogue been more sharp, nor the lines more musical. However, treating this movie requires that you consider it a lawyer. This movie is a case and the viewer is the judge. This is how this image should be enjoyed. 10.7.
