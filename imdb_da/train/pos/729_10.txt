I really love this movie so much, I never get sick of seeing it. The only line I really can't mimic in this is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but apart from that, everything else is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who Ramones was before filming this movie, but I can mostly ignore her very small face. Most people who see this over and over are fans of Ramones and really. That's the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing DeeDee destroy his Pizza lines or Joey root up the name of the teacher over and over again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is watching them sing, you want to dance down into high school. I love it. Special edition The DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly, PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she was working on another project * grin * Anyway, good movie, even better if you are a Ramones fan.
