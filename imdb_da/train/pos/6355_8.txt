I already loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I still love it now, 5 years later. Still, many people do not seem to disagree with my opinion, and this film has never really had much love at the time it came out. Of course, the movie is over-the-top and campy, but it knows the same is why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are perfectly executed over-the-top in a fun way without ever being really ridiculous. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie that does the very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this funny little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as Grinch. He really carries the film with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an Oscar. Of course, if you are a Jim Carrey hate, you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he does it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good morale, but it's a bit sappy to me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch, and we're not really celebrating Christmas, which is enthusiastic and great here, as in the US or England. For me, the movie was simply fun and entertaining, and the morality just left me right to be honest. <br /> <br /> The musical score of James Horner is good and fun, although it is your average every day Horner stuff, it still works perfectly for the movie and helps to do some of the stage work. Perfect Christmas day. <br /> <br /> 8/10
