The story was quite interesting, but the characters were pretty flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More extreme than necessary. I also think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro doesn't really make me happy to play a semi-autistic chess player, not to mention the Italian player. Also, motives were not much discussed. <br /> <br />
