See if I was interested in a Nancy Drew book, what I would do is download a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I remember, I read people who wasted movies because it wasn't like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on books, but I'm sure you can still find a few short silent movies in book form. When the Ring of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Oscar - "The book was better." When I looked at killing a mockingbird, "the book was better". Now, a lot of people are sad yet because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew will win any Oscars - if that is, it will be one of the Nickelodeon Blimps or the Kids Choice Awards. I say to give a break a movie. It's movies, not paper. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew quite entertaining - with Comos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (the Hebrew hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper at O.C) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I've seen Emma Roberts in a movie, and honestly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and Erics; her character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to conflicts. A shiny film in Harriet Spyens spirit is beautiful now and again. <br /> <br /> I give it ten stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, would love to watch it again and will probably buy it on DVD release.
