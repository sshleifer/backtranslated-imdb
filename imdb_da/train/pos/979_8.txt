Peaceful ranches Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a series of wars with his ruthless neighbors, that is, until infamous outlaw Robert Preston emerges from the blue to smooth out the rules. Soon, he begins to go too far and feel a growing sense of turmoil in Sterling, especially when his son begins to idolize the wretched criminals. Sundowners is a tight, gritty and surprisingly hard little picture with a fantastic performance by Preston. Here he comes across as an evil version of Shane, it is until the real nature of the ranch and the crime's relationship is revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise! <br /> <br /> Rounding off the cast is Chill Wills, Jack Elam, and the debut of John Drew Barrymore, who became more famous for his offspring than his acting.
