I watched this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a true spin on a romance that explores clever, fun, and sometimes shocking situations around man's most powerful emotions. Cast is huge, a true sea 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They give all performances somehow. <br /> <br /> It is not to mention that there is one who is directors who mix stories in clever and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This movie is not exactly romance or romantic comedy, although it is both romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
