It is a refreshing air impression when a movie actually gives you a storyline with a beginning, a middle and an end, a nice and smart mystery with an alluring appeal for all ages, winning us with its blessing and charm. In fact, Andrew Fleming's film is a modern wonder, a step back to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood. He removes the overload of special effects, which now passes for entertainment and gives us a great movie with a very talented young actress and a talented backing. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on the old books, but it has been updated enough to launch into this century; But the props can be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and there is a clever one here that binds the traditions of the old and nuances of contemporary youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that lack much from today's movies. She is still good enough to get the boys' attention, but she also knows how current poise and self-respect. She earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little shed when needed to reach her goals. <br /> <br /> While taking a vacation to California, our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a Hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play; Suddenly, she is "visited" by her ghost and this sets a series of events that can solve the mystery or result in something terrible for themselves. What makes the movie quite entertaining are the little details as she discovers that her usual world is nothing like California's scene, and it is well presented without resorting to unnecessarily vulgar language or any graphic or overtly sexual. Eventually, the director has enough control to make it very sweet to any kind of audience, from the young to the adults in the audience. It's a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated and enjoyed, a movie that is rare and delicate, and it's not afraid to be classified as fun! Five stars
