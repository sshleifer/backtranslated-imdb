Steely, powerful gangster-highest Frankie Diomede (the always stunning Lee Van Cleef in fine robust form) is himself arrested and sent to jail, so he can rub off a treacherous partner sense of detection. Fawning goofball little-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (a gracious depiction of Tony Lo Bianco) is also busted. Frank and Tony are an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the collection and helps him look for a rival group of mobsters led by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbent script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant pace, maintains an appropriate gritty, but occasionally light-headed tone all the way through, putting the brilliant action into pieces with significant rip snorting brio (a creepy jailhouse shower brawl and a prolonged mondo destructo car chase rate as the crucial exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a beautiful, loose and engaging screen chemistry; The relationship between their characters is alternately fun and touching. The overwhelming Edwige Fenech doesn't have much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least has to wear her crazy beautiful and successful body in a much-appreciated free naked shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk / jazz score certainly hits the fun swinging spot. The polished film by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti are also impressive. A really nifty and entertaining little winner.
