Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has had a series of flop games after a big hit. He receives a game written by a student of his, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who is fantastic. It's so good, Sidney says he would kill for it. Will he? <br /> <br /> A thinking man's thriller. It was originally a game ... and it shows. It's mostly on a set and everyone is talking, but I never got bored. It is very well written with lots of phrases and a good throw works full force. Caine is just amazing as Bruhl - another of his amazing performances. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I never thought much about him as an actor, but he is really good at this role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a signed role as Bruhls wife. Irene Worth is also good (and quite fun) like Helga ten Drop, a psychic. But her accent got on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet is doing well with one set. The camera always moves and keeps your attention going. <br /> <br /> EXTRA SPOILS DEAD WEIGHTED !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths, and it also contains one of the most uromantic kisses I've ever seen - but it's mild complaints. A very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have disappeared completely since it premiered in 1982. It's too bad - it deserves better.
