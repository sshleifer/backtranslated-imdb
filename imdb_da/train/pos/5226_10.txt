What about all the European (especially England) comments here? All I have to say is that when I watched this movie for the first time when I was like 13, I thought it was great. Of course it is stupid. That is the point. You should watch the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but did people come, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors in them. For what it's worth, men in white are a very stupid funny spot on a movie. And with all the stupid fun stuff that England has done in the last half century, I'm shocked at all the negative comments. We stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' for some real laughs that Europeans want in particular. HA!
