This well-known story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly hard-cut. Bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort. Lead actress Patricia Wymer, titled "Candy", offers the best performance of her career (spanning all 3 drive-in epics). Wymer was precocious and retrieved in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but gives a more serious performance in The BABYSITTER. The occasional violence and periodic nudity is somewhat surprising, but handled by the director. Leads Wymer and George E. Carey sell the May / December romance credibly. There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES to get one to wonder about the same director of hell the latter movie. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> Greetings from Seattle, WA, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on TV rock and roll show MALIBU U, before graceful coverage (as well as in an eight-page spread) of August, 1968 edition of " Best For Men ", a tasteful adult-only magazine. She also appeared as a coven witch in the popular 1969 cult drive-in shocker THE WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> BABYSITTER has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight-film BCI box set DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS Vol. 3 available from Amazon.com and some retail stores such as Best Buy.
