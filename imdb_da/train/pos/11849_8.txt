If only ALL animations were so great. This movie is classic because it is strong, are two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt for all the characters, and the relationship between humans and animals in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation have not worked better in any other movie. This is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10.
