"Saving Grace" is never incredibly fun, but it does deliver a couple of good laughs and I have had it to a considerable extent. Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job by portraying the widow Grace, who is vacationing to growing marijuana to pay her massive debts. The support supports also do a good job. The French actor Tchecky Karyo has a fun little role. The pastor alone is appealing. The idea of ​​growing and smoking the pot over tall women sounds funny enough. And the film plays around with the prerequisite wise, now and then. Of course, there are flat moments like one where two older women fail Grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they begin to draw childish antics in the shop where they work. It was a mindless gag that didn't quite go away. The film's tone is downward and occasionally boring, but I have enough laughs to give this English import a recommendation. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
