Enchanted April is a show day, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece to convey a few words in a message. It has been one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the movie to come out in DVD format. Apparently I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the parent's Amazon listings are correct, many people want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The casting is spectacular, the cinematography and the direction impeccable. The movie is a particular goalkeeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
