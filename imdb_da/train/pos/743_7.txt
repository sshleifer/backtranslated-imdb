This work is striking in its exact depiction of teenage life at the time of its implementation. While this is a broad generalization, the parents of the self-absorption time were real parents, and those who were at home tended to be too distracted from the real problems their children were worried about. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and does it with a sweet, melancholy but informed style, where Foster speaks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was actually my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The transition from funeral to wedding was supposed to show that life continues, and we must too. Baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning ones was supposed to show us that the troubled times will pass and we have to get through them for better times. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor of "moving forward," and the procession of life are present throughout the film and serve to give us hope in the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, though I don't see it often as it tends to make me melancholy. It should not be seen by toddlers, and probably only those bred in the 1970s and 80s would like to. <br /> <br /> It bets a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
