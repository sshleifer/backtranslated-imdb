Alain Delon visits quick, secure revenge on the ruthless criminal family who hired him as a hitman in the Duccio Tessari thriller "Big Guns" after they accidentally murdered his wife and child. Tessari and scenarios Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "One minute to pray, another to die" and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this actioneer about a career gun for the mob right down the lead. In fact, "Big Guns" is pretty predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of wild and often sudden killings. Alain Delon from "The Godson" is appropriately laconic as he methodically treats death to the heads of the mob families who refused to allow him to retire so he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte from "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian criminal chief who wants to bury the hatchet with the Delon character, but the rest of his hardnosed associates will have the dead man dead. Like most criminal thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" subscribes to cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, one man who has nothing to do with the wife and her son's murder survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari doesn't waste a second in this 90 minute shoot'em up. Except that the mother and son die in a car bomb intended for the father, find the worst place that takes place in a car processing yard when a helper is crushed in an unwanted car. Probably "Big Guns" is a pretty bloodless excursion, but it has a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama. Only at the last moment our protagonist gives himself the shelling, and therefore it is the eye of tenderness intact. Tessari stages a couple of decent cargoes and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is just as bloody as this violent yarn gets. The photography and compositions are excellent.
