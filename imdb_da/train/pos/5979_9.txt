Undoubtedly, the best heavy metal horror element is made in the manic headbangin''80s, which does not sound so much considering how extremely many other entrances in this weird little horror movie subgenre like Hard Rock Zombies, Blood Tracks, "Terror on Tour" and the particularly wicked Jon-Mikl Thor star-clamped "Rock'n'Roll Nightmare" tend to be. On the other hand, this still deserves props to play the exaggerated splatter and unnecessarily flashy special f / x razzle glare in favor of focusing on young high school characters depicted with greater sharpness and plausibility than the norm of a mid-80s teenage-targeted scarefest, and the movie's pointed sardonic parody of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs, who claimed it was the devil's music, is very clever and fun on the money (famous greens decade heavy with all good Ozzy Osbourne has a wonderful piece like a smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist!). <br /> <br /> Marc Price (the hopeless dweeby Skippy on "Family Ties") provides a surprisingly strong and winning performance like Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer, a geeky, socially awkward and seriously persecuted heavy metal aficionado that is constantly chosen of the poor jerk preppie bullies, which make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School (the atrocity and the middle ages of the high school children are nailed with painfully credible accuracy). Eddie's life takes a trip to worse when his rock star idol Sammi Curr (an impressive whacked-out depiction of Tony Fields) bypasses a hotel fire. Hip local disc jockey Nuke (KISS frontman Gene Simmons in a cool cameo) hangs Eddie up with Sammy's final, unpublished album, which, when playing backwards, revives Curr's vicious spirit back from the dead. Sammi encourages Eddie to see him at all the dizzying scumbags that make poor Eddie's life the compounded hell of hell, for only the gentle Eddie to be the most reluctant will be accomplice. It's up to Eddie, assisted by the token nice girl Leslie Graham (who emerged from the lovely Lisa Orgolini), to stop Sammi before things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> Ably aimed at commendable consideration and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith (also briefly shown as a nursery school teacher), cleverly written by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson and Rhet Topham, and capably acted by a uniform up-to-snuff cast, this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty "jump" moments (a monstrous attack on the back of a car with a grotesque lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie betting as the decisive highlight) A bursting "Carrie" style high school dance slaughter order, a nicely utilized Halloween setting, revenge is properly shown as a really nasty business and a solid central note that you shouldn't make a particular overhyped person your very strict because of The calculated anti-establishment makes that fellow doing so to qualify for is the special status.
