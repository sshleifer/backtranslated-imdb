This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down's syndrome. The character development of this film is excellent. We are going to believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family and Georges is an innocent man who wants to love and care for the "normal" society. Acting is excellent and the Cannes best actress award is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film highlight the fact that Georges misery towards his surrender of the family and his desire to be treated as a normal person. The song, which is played repeatedly, also strengthens this message. The film shows that people who are mentally disabled are good natured people. We've treated them with discrimination and neglect, which is highlighted by the scene where Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally handicapped can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so drawn into the movie and the characters' emotional experiences. It is a touching film for good-natured souls.
