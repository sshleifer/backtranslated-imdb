Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I hardly saw it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a rather enjoyable horror movie. The action was not great - apart from the wonderful Alice Wars - but part of the dialogue ("Consider yourself lunch.") Be totally entertaining. On the whole, an above-average Stephen King bet - 7/10.
