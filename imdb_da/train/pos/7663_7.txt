As a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I gave it a shot. That is not bad. Not good, but it's something else. The film involves a battle with a mysterious (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the worldly world that he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Any spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and do so to find a companion who protects a fortress; However, the guard has been blinded. His eyes are broken pits. So the guide goes over each other's eyes, and hey, presto! His eyes have been restored! This kind of healing seems to work only with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Suffer, Mordred and his "brother" animate a few animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> But then the picture is not bad at all, but much like a cartoon. Dr. Mordred's more "human" adventure is okay, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen much worse.
