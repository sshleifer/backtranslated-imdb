China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvest production was fucked by veteran leader Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he lost his touch because he is not so big of an instructor. The only reason to watch this movie is to watch the fighting skills of Mrs Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flip. China O'Brien returns home to help her father. He has problems with the local mob and he needs her help. Then she returns home and restores the order (using two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mister Big and his evil cronies? <br /> <br /> If you are a big Cynthia Rothrock fan, this movie is welcomed to you. I just enjoyed the games, everything else is rubbish. Why did Raymond Chow not have a few centuries and hire a top-action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
