This show is fast-witted, colorful, dark yet fun, hip and still somehow clean. The cast, including a fantastic rotation of special guests (ie Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family and zombies without ever coming out as a cartoonist ... somehow. You really connect with these characters. The whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me, something of a skeptic, if I say it myself, completely engrossed and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I read this precisely, and it sounds a bit like someone paid me to write it. It's really that good. I just heard a rumor that it was canceled, so I thought I'd send a flare of goodwill. This is one of the shows that goes under the radar, because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Make yourself a great service if you don't already have it and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK one more thing. This show is wise. What that means is that all of the armchair critics / "writers" in Hollywood will put a stick on their digknowwhat before they sit down to watch it and defend themselves with an "I could have written it" type of speech to absolutely none in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words, the Internet. This is a general interest / anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV time to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model bother or anything else out and out tripe these internet "critics" don't comment, give my fave 'show a spin. It is fun. Good, unpretentious fun.
