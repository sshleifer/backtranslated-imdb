After Chicago I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then came The Flock. There is just as much a beautiful smile, and a few storage movements can get you, but he showed me that he finally got hold of his craft and can trade with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as his "trainee / replacement". Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I don't see it like that. Nothing, I saw the power of this movie deteriorated. I was really shocked, I hadn't heard that it was released in theaters and came across it at Blockbuster instead. Really an excellent movie with the right mix of action, excitement, excitement and social awareness. Almost 7even? Well, maybe. And you will look better from Gere than anyone has ever come out of Pitt.
