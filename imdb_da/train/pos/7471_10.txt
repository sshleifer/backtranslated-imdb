Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected to be disappointed with the movie because I had heard it didn't get good reviews. But I left the cinema in awe of how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was nothing bad about the whole movie, every character is trustworthy. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are tearfully realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be couple). <br /> <br /> Plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there is very little chance of guessing the end. But the ends are tied up to the end, where you get a strange mix of emotions consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The movie is intellectual and you need to be aware of all the time. It's not that hard, because chances are that you will be completely drawn into the movie and not take your eyes off the screen for a second. I usually leave cinemas that forget about movies I just watch. But Vanilla Sky is still lingering in my mind days after seeing it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, superficial movies.
