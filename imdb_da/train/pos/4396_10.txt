I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (spelling mistakes) and Jewel were excellent in their support roles. That was Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire gave as well a play as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend's arm knowing he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to capture the Southern Accent incredibly well. Why this movie was swept under the blanket of Hollywood promoters, I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it more appealing to me. I have given a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Completely overlooked movie. Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a few hours, then judge.
