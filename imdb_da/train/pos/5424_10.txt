"Swing Your": One of the greatest adventure stories ever told! A story of the British foreign legion of 19th century India and a small "water carrier" named Gunga Din, a local denizen who strives to be like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose loyalty and companionship extend far beyond the limits of pure patriotism. Theirs is a true and close friendship to each other, and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life to the other. Swinging you also longs to be a soldier, especially a bugler, but can never reach that rank because of his subordinate social position. But heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they are made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Swing Your every turn tries to prove his mettle, but will he ever reach the rank he so passionately seeks? .... "You are a better man than I am, swing your"! One of Hollywood's classics and a perfect 10 !!!!
