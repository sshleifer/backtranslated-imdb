I totally agree that "Nothing" is a great movie! I haven't laughed so much when I watch movies for years! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are amazing in this! They work really well together! This movie can't appeal to some people (I can't really say why without spoiling it!) But separately! I loved it and recommended it! <br /> <br /> The management is great and some of the pictures are very clever. It looks like they might have been having fun filming it! <br /> <br /> Although there are only two main characters in the movie and not a horrible mass of props, the actors manage to pull it out and make the movie fun to watch.
