The only thing about this movie that puffs me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment or I would buy it because the movie is a good example of film noir ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces good DVDs, but sometimes the price that asks is a bit more. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound movie that's good but nothing extraordinary, cinematic. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here (as opposed to art, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) unintentionally won by espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peter's purse. (say it three times!). All but Peters is a credible sign in this movie: Widmark, the police, the US agents and the Communists and especially Ritter as "Moe", an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this movie. Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy, but loses his credibility early by falling in love with Widmark at the first meeting, even though he is crazy about her. Only in the world of movies !! Too bad because the ridiculous romance part of the story takes away from it. <br /> <br /> This is an average film noir, which means good but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35. the market.
