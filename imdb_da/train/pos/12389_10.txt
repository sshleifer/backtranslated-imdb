Bored with the normal, run-of-the-mill booklets to watch this Halloween I have seen over and over again, I took a chance at "The Sentinel", hoping it could get my horror screams back on. Remind you, I just got back from watching the Dark Castle remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" - complete and complete crap. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" got me away! In a raging story of a model moving into a creepy building in the Brooklyn Hights, the movie offered everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campy and imaginative juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including Hilarious fluctuations by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam, as an absent mind professor - (2) Frightening terror! Not to give a frame away, but there are scenes in this movie that cools me to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic gore, great makeup and crazy (if very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, floating pretty well with this unreal treat . If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your queen of favorites. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after I saw it for the first time, I stroked it again and saw it again. It is now one of the favorites all the time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
