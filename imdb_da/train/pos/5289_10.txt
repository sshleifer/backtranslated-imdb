John Waters has made the most effusive liquid, profound, dark, personal little movie I think I've ever seen (maybe Fast Food Fast Women comes in close second) The director's vision is untouched ... the story is moody, the characters are personal and odd reflections of the family and its own inner life ... the tone is never forced or stylistically overblown. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious shot design, ennui or magazine grading .... Martha Plimpton is great as a sister .. Eddie Furlong is inspired casting. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea packaging, recycled clothes, yesterday's waste becomes today's art - and the lesson in the movie is that the most important thing we can appreciate is family ... and a humble life.
