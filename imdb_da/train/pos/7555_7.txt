Gender Bender buys things a little for the x files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an ending that is out. Gender Bender is also the x-files debut for actress Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of "The Kindred". You should see this episode to see Nic Leas less than spectacular beginnings. An interesting thing about Kindred's "power to seduction". When Marty makes it his victims, they are turned on him / her. But when Andrew seduces Scully, she is only disoriented and groggy, and is not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience with it than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would sometimes be miserable to record in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, it's so wet, soggy and muddy, it couldn't have been so much fun. Despite the disappointing conclusion, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
