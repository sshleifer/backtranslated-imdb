It was hard for me to believe in all the negative comments about this all-star flick. I laughed through the whole picture, just like my whole family. The movie defined itself as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old age while doing it. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and what about the Everly sisters, each of the two Falcos and the divine music throughout. Rob Reiner made a big laugh limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne a ridiculously neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and digger digger references. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining confidence, with the added attraction of scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his "My Way" welcome home to the Vick performance. I believe this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I'm also of the opinion that none of any age would even think of imitating the actions that took place in this movie - it's a joke - not a scary "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive as was the decorative "Vic's Place". Really, I'm thinking of "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, television crimes, and speech shows. I would recommend the video for a family entertainment evening.
