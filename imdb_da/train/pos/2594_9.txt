This movie took Jerry Springer's access to super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is the kind of theme-based movie I love and addresses the idea that prodigies in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempting to hide them. At the same time, the film points out that every marvel is only human and no more fearing or worshiping than any other human being. This was a great comedy, fun and human with the little satirical edge.
