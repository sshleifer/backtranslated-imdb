Back in the eighties, when movie-related cases that were not yet allowed in "polite" societies, they went to codes that apparently fluttered over the head of the audience while warning them in the knowledge of just what was up. Probably no decade movie was transported with insinuation as the oddly fuzzy Desert Fury, set in a little play oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The Purple Sage Salon and Casino owner is the amazing Mary Astor, in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder; Entering the city runs her handful of daughter, Lizabeth Scott, and sees in Technicolor $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, suggesting an older lesbian and her young, troubled companion (one can only wonder if A.I. Bezzeride's original script made this relationship explicit). Even more obvious is John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insane jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the city's sheriff, stir and sit back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall for Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor, but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil, with face extensions aplenty and empurpled exchanges. Don't try to pass this hothouse melodrama, chock full of scary exotic flowers, if it comes your way; It is a remarkable movie.
