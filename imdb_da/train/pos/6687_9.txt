Although I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I've read my share so I think I'm part of the audience of this movie and I wasn't disappointed. It runs out of steam at the end, it's almost crowded with ideas, and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the floor. Also a bit of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all those mistakes when you have a movie that's so much fun. All actors seem to have a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as straight-arrow Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the city's design to make joke even more fun. I also liked how disco was the music chosen by the evil guys; Somehow it seemed appropriate.
