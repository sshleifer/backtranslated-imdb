"A really good story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this odd David Lynch movie. This was especially "odd" because it wasn't the kind of movie Lynch had put out in the last 15-20 years. It was dark and shocking movies (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive), and that's the opposite. I know many of his fans are disappointed. Others were happy about it. Count me as one of the latter and I also own all three of these "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another presumably true life story detailing an elderly man's walk in a sitting mower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his failing brother whom he hasn't talked to this year but wants to see before the latter dies. Now, I think the premise - an old man running a mower 400 miles - still makes it an "odd" movie of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with it! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the kind of guy, facial, vocal, key personality that everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this movie was released. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie is not much, and not always pleasant, as it shows the main character's adults and mentally challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but when Alvin Straight (Farnsworth ) begins its turn, the story arises. I played this for several friends and they thought the movie NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. For them it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found his trip quite fascinating, but you have to realize in advance that it will NOT be an exciting Lynch crime story. It's slow, and if it's okay with you, you like it here. Charm goes into the picture of some people whom Alvin encounters along the way, as an adventurous young girl who runs away and some cozy townspeople who help the old man when he gets into trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan is a standout in that respect.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but it's a joke: he's only in the last few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> The Iowa scenario I have lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich land. It is a lovely state with nice people .... like this movie.
