Not sure why it doesn't play in Peoria, apparently, but it's a very fun and smart British comedy. It is set at the end of "swinging sixties". Peter Sellars is great as the rich, forty-something serial womanizer. The wonderful Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is initially Sellar's "catch of the day". But the urban television critic cannot stop from falling to the dizzying American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, strong performances by the leaders and supportive throws. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and the best gag is the last line. Try it, you like it.
