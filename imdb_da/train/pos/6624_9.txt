I highly recommend this movie. Seen in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris, it is mostly a classic movie noir script: Lady in danger, sister trying to find her, honest policeman fighting for everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotypical, combining a pretty good story with interesting, innovative images. The movie may resemble Sin City in appearance, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic novel look that I found really convincing. Each frame looks each sequence as if it could be pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of history and works of art, you can find nods back to the 1900s (or even earlier with the classical views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and films like Casablanca, as well as look at a grim future where our destinations are governed by companies. Make some excuse you have to watch this movie.
