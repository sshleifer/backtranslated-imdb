Personally, this is one of my favorites all the time! no, i'm not 10 .. i'm 30! I own an old, original VHS of this I bought from a rental shop. I've seen countless times. <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's an exciting movie for adults. I once saw this movie whiile I was .. not sober. My eyes were opened to things I had never noticed before. I saw strong encouragement, both obviously and slightly subliminally. I wish I could remember all the things I noticed especially, but it has been a very long time since then. Be sure there are TONS of things that appear throughout the movie. if you get the chance to see it .. not sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed .. in fact you will probably feel quite happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
