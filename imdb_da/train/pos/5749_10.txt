I would warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality for this comment. Also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you once you've seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Though it is tragically sad to say, the movie has a resemblance to my life, which is so striking that it is truly scary. The rest of you will never know how precisely that movie portrays how people who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives. <br /> <br /> This could not have been a fiction work; It had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testament to how well the movie was, is shown by the fact that even though it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a hurtful pain experience that I will never be able to see it again. <br /> <br /> But I heartily support everyone else as a chance to lie in the soul of another human being to the extent that you have probably never experienced before or ever again. I know this for a fact, because it's my soul you want to observe.
