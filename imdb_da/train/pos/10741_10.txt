The French Naudet brothers did something no one else did, they had a video camera the day this tragedy happened. They were in Building No. 2, when one could see papers sliding down, people hit the ground from jumping from such a height. <br /> <br /> I think it goes as far as both buildings collapsed, the running camera still ran when the white dust covered them, they found a store door opening and came in, but all this recording is real, and I think they did a fantastic job capturing it for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary movie, which I see every 9/11, so I will never forget what that country went through. I think if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the firefighter's priest while he was carried to the church and his honorable burial.
