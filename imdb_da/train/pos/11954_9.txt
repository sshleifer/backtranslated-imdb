Amazing movie, enough laughs and action for any audience. Since the last person who wrote on this movie took it upon himself to call Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the movie, here I am. <Br /> <br /> The movie follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, following a tip given to them by the ghost of a recent dead English reporter. Their search takes them into the killer, and finally to a somewhat tragic end. But don't let the plot fool you, the movie is really fun and the play is amazing. It seems that as directors reach a certain age, they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to do some of the most imaginative work in their respective careers. Also from watching the movie in a pact theater, you can just tell people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback. The second he went on the screen lit the audience. There's just something about the man, and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
