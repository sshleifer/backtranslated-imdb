Big S does not play with taboos or force an agenda such as. Mencia or Chapelle (though I like both of them). She says it obvious in subtle, nearby subliminal remarks. Her show will not change the world, nor is it intended. But along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show" fame, this is a mediocre show with an appetite for destruction! My site was thoroughly destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with it. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing something and anyone like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds for quick striking comments about societies and college aged existential nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a fun leg (and did not lose it in their latest lipo-suction treatment or boob job).
