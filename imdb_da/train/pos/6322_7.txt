This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I've never seen an ad or a trailer so I didn't know that Clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole casting was suitable and found the movie quite enjoyable, all in all. The opening scene, with the small bandit's crew standing next to the road, looking whipped and harvested, caught my attention right away. It had a way of telling you, "Don't go away, it won't be boring," and it really wasn't. It turned out to be an interesting, light-hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your place at last, but when the end arrived, I felt a bit cheated ... just a little bit. The events continued to build up, so you expect them to continue to build, but at a time I can't define, it's kind of levels, making the end a little disappointment. I expect I had expected a bigger blow on a climax, but it turned out to be a low key. If you see the movie with that in mind and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this flick very entertaining and worth seeing. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it is another rare find in the United States.
