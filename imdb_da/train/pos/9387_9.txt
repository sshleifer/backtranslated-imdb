As others have commented, I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert performed this as one of their top 10 films this year. What a gift. So I went out to buy it just for letting it out. <br /> <br /> Best Quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is at the top of his cab. When Cage's comrades down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum presses his gun in the face of the cage with "Does it look like I'm scared?" Great bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. There was really a sense of fun for this. The constant observation of the "Welcome to Red Rock" sign evokes a moaning and smiling headache. The music created a hunting, creepy quality for the movie reminiscent of "Twin Peaks". However, unlike the "Twin Peaks" it does not destroy anything by going too far into the foreign, which must "top" itself. <br /> <br /> I admit to seeing the credits 15-20 times. You see, they had Yoakum's "Millennium from nowhere" (perfectly selected) as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor. . with snow-covered mountains in the distance. This was incredible, fluid framing. Moreover, I have never seen a better union of sight and sound on film. It also fits in with the story.
