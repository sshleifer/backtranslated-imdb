I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the movie of the movie was realistic and relevant at all times in American history. There is always the woman who does what she has to do to climb the class system. I feel that Lilly's character was portrayed correctly and couldn't be done better. What I enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her, had given her everything, even lost their career for her. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these men gave up all too happiness. The way her life had ended was far from what she expected to be possible. I would recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and underlying meaning of the movie and plot.
