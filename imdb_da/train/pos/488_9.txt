Part of the pleasure I took from this movie comes from the fact that I didn't know anything more than what starred with John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to see) was a period and involved chess. Everything that evolved for me was completely unexpected. I will therefore not give away much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and Em that suits him goes step by step like the strong-minded woman who is attracted to him. It is about love and obsession, rather than the honorable board game, and after I gradually pulled in during the first half hour, it became quite convincing. And I defy anyone to guess the end.
