I am surprised that many viewers are more respectful of the successor to this brilliant movie ... I've seen all the guinea pigs, and this one is easily the best. Although I have seen the "production of", I'm still in doubt when you see the 35min pure torture: it is so powerful. A 10 out of 10 because this movie made perfect what it was supposed to do: be the best fake snus movie ever made.
