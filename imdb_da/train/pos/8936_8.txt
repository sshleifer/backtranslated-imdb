After "Beau travail" everyone waited for Claire Denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never arrived. Now it has. Denis makes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy with beautiful filmography, elliptical editing, and intentionally unclear narrative events that feel weird and seem strange. There is a nominal plot (derived in part from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same name) about a mature man in need of heart transplant, seeking a Tahitian son he left long ago; But for the most part, it is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusion. It takes a few views to fully understand, and has pacing problems close to the end, but it is increasingly sophisticated and gripping than anything else I've seen this year. Miss it at your danger.
