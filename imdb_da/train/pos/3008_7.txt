The unflappable William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without care in the world. He always works on top of his game and shows some care for anyone who doubts him. The murders are projects, barely people. I noticed that this is a staple for whodunnit. Other than an occasional crying widow, the victims fulfill the function of the reason why the film exists. Nothing more. There are enough phrases to keep things interesting along the way, and Powell is the master of this. There is a lot of political inaccuracy, especially since it concerns Asian artists. It's a little hard to take. The cast is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
