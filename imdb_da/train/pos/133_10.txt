A few years ago, a friend from one of his other friends got a video with the Michael Mann movie 'Heat' on it. When we finished that movie and we were getting up, we saw that there was another movie right after, hard on the cassette envelope, the owner owned it. But we were all glued back to our seats at its clear opening, which lacked credits. <br /> <br /> A couple of hours later I was just wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before? ... <br /> <br /> This movie was Europe. Lars von Trier woke up film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentional obvious sets, but there was often joking resemblance to postwar German photographs I saw. And then they are difficult cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a hard to take moral odyssey that doesn't have a happy ending. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, who intends to do something good to pay for the bombs that his compatriots fell. But he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive dislike. He hires Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi partners Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When he does not understand the world (or just Europeans) in his anger, he springs a railway bridge under a train which he has just saved. <br /> <br /> As a final note to historical correction: the real world, the warwolf was not as important as the movie implies, they were mostly a last Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit murdered the majority of the Allied-Occupied Aachen, two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, werewolf. But just a few hundred of Hitler Youth received a lot of training, and while two or three were deployed to murder suspected Communists or forced laborers in Bavarian villages to try out lasting fears of the inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the end of war, everything fell apart. <br /> <br /> However, werewolf propaganda had a profound impact on the herds. They feared the werewolf everywhere, suspecting it of any serious accident - but without exception, another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas strain exploded in the police headquarters of the bombarded Bremen, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest on the Soviets who arrested tens of thousands (largely children!) "Preemptively" suspected of being a werewolf and locked them in prison camps, many of whom died.
