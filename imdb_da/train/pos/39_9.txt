This is apparently one of Shemp's first shorts with Stooges. (This excludes his very earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the triangular comic timing here is best here. Apart from the intense slapstick scenes, others are more subtle, but just as fun. See Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or see the real object that asks Moe's exclamation, "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is by his confused goofiest. And the goon can look scary, but he's fun. He seems so frustrated and confused with Stooges as it is "ordinary" people in other shorts. For Shemp aficionados, this is a must have episode. It won't disappoint.
