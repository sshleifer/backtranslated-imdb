I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen it many times and always look forward to seeing it again. Although it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the new plots and subplots were developed satisfactorily. All the characters are well depicted. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel without silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect poetry of the actors. The setting and costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite on par with the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice", but then the producer and the scriptwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job depicting "Emma" as Jane Austen said she would create a heroin no, but she would love. She is snobbish but has just enough youth and lack of experience to be still sympathetic. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr Knightley, not an easy part, I think, although he did not have the charisma shown by Colin Firth's Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Finally, the scene (autumn festival), which does not take place in the novel, gives an appropriate end unless it shows that Emma is cold and almost uncomfortable with Frank Churchill, while in the short story she was thoroughly united with him, even telling him she wanted Had double, she had been in his situation. A strange deviation from the faithfulness that is otherwise seen throughout the film. I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen's novels.
