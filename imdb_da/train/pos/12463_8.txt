Nora is a single mother-to-two who still wants to live a young artist's life in the 1970s, like their friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The "free love" philosophy is not completely out of the system ?? and Nora did not expect to fall in love, especially with a junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI awards over four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora, who makes her do the right thing with her children, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Yarns ?? who would later cost in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATALOGS AND STRANGE PLANET ?? is well-groomed as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in preparation for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ???) appears as a bearded painter. Early intervention by director Cameron is a winner; He continued to make the award-winning miniseries MIT BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it is the fantastic delivery of Hazlehurst that brings the life of the intelligent search script based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
