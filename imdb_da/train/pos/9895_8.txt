A bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on Nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) who leaves him shamelessly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion. Of course, an angry and vindictive Marty dressed in a jester shows costume to clarify a pig's revenge on his ailments. Authors / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale play all the endearingly corny cliches that make these 80s slice'n'dice body counter flicks so much cheesy fun: fake bounces, prowling steady shots, a violent storm, a crazy groovy hard rock soundtrack, a nice smattering of free female nudity, a completely ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, sticky makeup f / x, and one of the lovably paralyzed "it was just a terrible dream" fake exuberance. In addition, the elaborate murder-sets deliver the ugly items: Gory highlights include a man's explosion after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a guy being crushed under a large tractor, and two people being electrocuted in middle to have wildly passionate sex. Thirtyish British Cult Horror Sirene Caroline Munro is a hilarious miscast as an American teenager in the first third of the girl. The players deliver solid performances, with special stand-out work by Carmine Iannaccone as a smartcheck leader. Spring Pollack, Billy Hartman as faded macho meathead Frank, and Donna Yeager as badly jaded Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a funny como like Munros slezy agent Manny. Harry Manfredini's moody rattling music reuses shamelessly recognizable from his "Friday the 13th" score. Alan Pudney's slick cinematography does the trick. Good, trashy fun.
