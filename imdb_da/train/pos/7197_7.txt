There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, for example. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by excellent actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This series allows you to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The series also has a good performance by various actors in movie B such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains such as John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance by Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
