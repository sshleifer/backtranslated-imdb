Never seen this movie and consider it a good classic with great veteran actors. During the time this movie was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except the radio and the start of amazing movies made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of young romance between a young girl or guy were seen differently than it is today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet," 44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself in a home of two older people who were like two clever owls and watched Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone, and if anything happened, the whole city found it within minutes. It's a peanut movie with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very simple way of living. Today it seems very majestic and stupid, but believe me, that was how people were in America in the 1920s. & 30s, and they were a great generation who loved good family movies.
