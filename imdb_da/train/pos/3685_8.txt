It's just such a joy to have seen this exciting project. So refreshing and educational. Not only for a film maker who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as an audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some, as expected, stand out. I thought Tom Tykwer (the Natalie Portman) segment was the best, though mimes made me smile within the same. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option for this review bus, alas what you read is a spoiler enough. Just see it. Don't read what I'm writing, but watch the movie instead. <br /> <br /> Smile.
