This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. It's far better than some other New York movies of the same era as: "The French Connection" or "The Take of Pelham 1-2-3". There is a greedy reality for this movie, which also manages to effectively use humor to promote the plot line. It is engaging from start to finish and has not tarnished with age, as is the case with the above two examples. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman becomes a brave performance as "Batman" and it is a pity that his career does not take off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Park's manager and, as it comes after "Shaft", initially seems to be a strange choice. Nevertheless, it is the first side of the past effort and approached as much in your face machismo. Unfortunately, this movie has not been available on either DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really have a gem on their hands, and it's a shame they don't do anything about it.
