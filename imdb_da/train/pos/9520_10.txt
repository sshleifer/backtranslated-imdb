This is a beautiful movie. The true story of bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the good lighthouses. Yet in this film he comes out in this movie as a bit gritty, but still appears smelly as a rose, even until the very first scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this movie was well put together. I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks' character shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and yet deep about no sound in that scene, just simply emotions. I love the look of John Rooney, Paul Newman's character face when he understands even before he sees him that it is Tom Hank's character to avenge and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away and knew that I had to go out and get the video, and since then I have added it to my collection of my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
