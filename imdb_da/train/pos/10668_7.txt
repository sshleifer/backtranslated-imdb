As many reviewers have noted here, the film version differs little from the scene version of the story. I have never seen the scene version of the story, and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for film director, but the film is still an entertaining statement for several dancers trying to make the big time in the choreographer Michael Douglas' show. The movie does it right by not choosing any famous actors or performers to win in the final test group. In this way, our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day with try-outs. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part. Apparently, some songs were carved in favor of a new one and the backstage clich√©-famous story of a romantic connection between a dancer and the choreographer was added. I must say in fairness that this was the weakest part of the movie. The repeated intrusions Cassie has made during trial attempts seem to reflect the almost desperate reasons one often has to do when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the movie has been made to death in the past and it is curious to see this tired old shoe kicking the heel up again. The dancers' revelations began promisingly enough with the song "I can do it", but then it jumped a bit at different points while the dancers told their stories. Frankly, their stories differ slightly from real people who never get a chance like this. *** of 4 stars.
