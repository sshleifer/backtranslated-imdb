Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most gifted, and over looked light comic actors in the last twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley for this movie. <br /> <br /> If you expect more from the same from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but it's still a good movie. Realizing that all Dog vs. Man's battle of will scenarios were probably used up in the first movie, this becomes a bit more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with Dooley's newly-deceased wife after She rejected her book and blames Dooley for her death. The script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting while still retaining enough of the light humor of the first movies to make it work and the chain between the two Stars are there for everyone to see. An easy, luminous movie that may not be worth buying unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or Belushi, definitely worth seeing when it comes to television. <br /> <br />
