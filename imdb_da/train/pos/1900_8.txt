The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role in his over-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously fun and alternating touching story that generates warm smiles, big stomachs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for his best performance as Arthur Bach, a drunk playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, loves women, but he has the weekends away and he is his own boss." Arthur is destined to inherit $ 750 million when he marries a snooty community girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry) who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress / fighting actress from Queens who steals jerseys for her father's birthday. Moore illuminates the screen in one of the most fun performances of the past 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a best supporting actor Oscar for his flawless ride as Arthur's acid-heavy butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other fun contributions from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's denied grandmother. The movie was ruled by a huge eye for comedy by a first-time director named Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died the following year. There was also a memorable sequel several years later, but this immediate classic must not be missed.
