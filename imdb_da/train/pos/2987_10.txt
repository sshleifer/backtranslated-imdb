This is the laugh that beaches were never. As much as I wanted to love beaches, it always seemed to hurry to "feel" for it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though). Stella, on the other hand, moves slower (and sometimes too slowly), and although it is somewhat manipulative in her tear-inducing story of a self-sacrificing mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast become good performances. 10.10
