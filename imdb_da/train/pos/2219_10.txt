This film was a fascinating look at Creole culture and society that few African Americans are aware of. My own two children are products of a grandfather whose father was a member of gens de couleur libre and a black skin wife whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from all his family except a sister who was annoyed at the situation of her brothers; travel 8 children during the Great Depression 1929; supplies the family with food when she could. Of course, she unhappy helped with this family who feared their own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We've made it a part of our library.
