If you want your vision of Chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your stomach laughing from pathos, see something else. But if you love slapstick comedy as done by one of the best, check it out here. <br /> <br /> The picture is of the tramp that really can't get the girl. He stains another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has a lot of destruction on their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies" recorded in Mack Sennett's park, with pickpockets and police and couples. These shorts work as the format allows Chaplin to shine as he weaves through preachers. <br /> <br /> I checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler, even if it wasn't if you watched these movies. Everyone ends up in the pond except Chaplin. He gets the girl, which in this case was played by Minta Durfee, et al. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
