I've read a number of reviews on this movie and I have to say "What's wrong with you people?!?!" This was an excellent movie! I thought this movie was great from start to finish and the story was very well told. I am convinced that the people who did not like this movie were not very aware of the movie. There are a number of very important scenes that, if you are not aware, you get confused and the following scenes cannot make sense. I urge anyone who did not like this movie to watch it again and watch it alone so you can really pay attention. The story made me perfect sense, and as I said it was very well told. Each scene in the movie has a point and everything fits together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was great as Tanny Brown plays a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a good touch and looks great. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I didn't really expect anything good from him, but he did a good job. Ed Harris was the real gem in the movie. He plays a really sick person and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. See his eyes in his scenes, just amazing !!! There is also a very young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of her first roles ... not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and should be seen. Don't listen to all the other people's opinions, watch the movie, and come to your own conclusions. I hope you will watch the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
