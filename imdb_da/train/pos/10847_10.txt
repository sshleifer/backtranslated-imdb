I'm 60 years old, a guitarist, (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years I've been in four bands, it's all there, the fighting, foul-ups, the rotten food, the worse housing, always traveling, little or no money, and each one was full or high. But the clubs, the fans and the music made it all worth it! Like strange fruit! I'm too old for it now, and arthritis in the hands and hips no longer means rocking, but for the length of that video it all came back and that was all there! The birds, brawls and spirits! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connol's voice over, God likes that 70s thing! Rock On Forever!
