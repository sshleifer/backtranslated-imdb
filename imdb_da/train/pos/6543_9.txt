I read all of Nancy Drew as a preteen and collecting the books as an adult. I loved the effect that was used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the movie, where line drawings in the books lined into scenes from the movie. It was a nice way to point out connections between situations in the film and the books. For example, the scenes with the Oriental Antique Dealer were much reminiscent of many scenarios I remember from the books. I thought Ned was perfectly thrown, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Like Betty Crocker's picture she keeps up with the times!)
