Deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane), who are invited to spend a week in Tomawka, a camp in Ontario. Canada by their former consuelor (Alan Arkin). Author / Instructor Mike Binder took on his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. Also, the movie has lots of fun moments, some of which are quite bizarre as my favorite, one involving the use of masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") gives the film some impressive shots of the Canadian wilderness. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of "THE EVIL DEAD" movie and "The Gift" is shown here as Arkin's bumbling right hand. One more thing, this movie reassured me that a camp does not have to be a place of bloody murders.
