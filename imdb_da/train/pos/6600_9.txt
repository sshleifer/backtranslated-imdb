I will keep this review short and sweet .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought I would give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my first thoughts were "what the hell is that? " But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I picked up my jaw from the floor. This film is a good example of how different a movie can be, and it is also French. This film is high art eye disc wrapped in a tidy futuristic film noir package, movement capture is very clever and the black and white animation style is not gray, although at first it didn't do it for me, completely fascinated me and at the end of the movie and I found myself that each movie was made like this. I think my opinion was helped by the great copying, it would have been very easy to destroy it if they hadn't landed so many respected actors since many voters didn't give any sense of the characters (Just see any Hong Kong -gender movies in English to see a perfect example) I gave it 9 though I gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new it all feels ....
