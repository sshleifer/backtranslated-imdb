Entertaining movies, though I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. It's a mystery halfway through the movie as to know why Elly is such a curse. So when we finally get an explanation that goes back to her childhood, there is still not much detail. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Still, it's still a good movie I wanted to see again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
