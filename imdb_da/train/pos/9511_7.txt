A bloody gangster story that takes place in the years of great depression. It tells us about another notorious hitman, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, the story is the second round: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed because of his own boss's dirty play. He succeeds in his revenge and ensures honest future for his son, but is eventually killed. Such stories never have a good end. <br /> <br /> The role played by Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks and that part of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia chief) was performed by Paul Newman. The film gives a good impression and we hear the familiar phrase "we rob banks". This movie is still worth seeing, although you might have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American beauty.
