This movie is wonderful. Writing, instructing, acting everyone is amazing. Very witty and wise script. Quality performances by actors, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and lovely quirky. Really original and heart-warming unpredictable. The scenes live with fresh energy and really talented production.
