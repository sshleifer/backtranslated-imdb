If you are amused by fair transitions that are logical within a given illogical situation, you will enjoy this capricious 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene looks plain, but the opponent, customers and two musicians somehow seem strange. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the musicians play and a man begins to sing the title song, dancing over tabletops with musical comedy gestures. Customers, at first immobile, intervals with chimes in (poorly but gamely) with sentences from the song, read from paper lists in their palms. On and off, they jump up and dance (awkward but honestly) in choreographed movements, like backup singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman is wondering. The answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what is attached over his chest - just before the explosive climax ... Even if you don't capture the song's (probably ironic) lyrics, the situation-perfect performance should give you a laugh and a chuckle .. I would love to see it again!
