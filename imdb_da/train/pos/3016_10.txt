For those who like their murder mysteries admitted, this is definitely the one to see as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them wealthy Long Island socialite types. As a star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, sometimes behaving as if he and his dress went to the cleaning assistants and were squeezed together. Mary Astor is very nice here. <br /> <br /> Powell had made a career out of playing the protagonist, Philo Vance, in a series of films made on a few studies over the years. Between these films he developed into a somewhat rude romantic leadership, sometimes even putting gentleman gangster roles. Already at age he was stuck in something of a career field when it came together. As with so many early talkie stars it seemed that his time had come and gone, that he was good at the early depression obsession films, but that with changing times he might be too mature and dandyish to endure. <br /> <Kennel Murder Case, directed by Criminal Officer Michael Curtiz, is one of the last of the "old Powells", while next year will be heralded in the first of the new, The Thin Man, if Success would catapult its leading players into the Hollywood stratosphere. In Kennel, we can still see the films in a slightly rigid ritualized pattern, as the camera does not move much, with the actor, like the presentation that goes towards the theater. However, there is no harm to this approach which has its charm. It gives the film a Baroque quality.
