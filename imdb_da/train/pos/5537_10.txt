Maybe it wasn't as good as it was, but the second episode, which was the first thing I said, was so memorable, I can still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. <br /> <br /> Chick's snakes, Chico Barnes, are much more entertaining for those of us who have never been close to hearing London's Bow Bells, but the managers are attractive and the shows were interesting. Sid Halley was one of Francis' more interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, electronic hands of the kind used in the stories seem less functional to the user than the kind invented after World War II.
