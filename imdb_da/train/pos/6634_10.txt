How can you not judge this movie with 10/10? I admit to saying that this movie is not very entertaining, but the goal is not to tell you a story but story! This is the first `real 'movie of cinema history (` le Prince de Galles' was first, but it was not technically enough?), And it has undoubtedly great international value. These people, whom you can see finishing their working day in the movie, had the chance to attend a historic moment as they became the first to see themselves moving! And above all, the shot is a beautiful shot! And it goes a lot when you think of the first people who have seen it! What a moment! Historical for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie for veneration!
