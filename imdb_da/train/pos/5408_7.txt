Out of these Pokemon movies (which are best for the least for me): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and The Unknown, this is probably the most about the environment, no doubt the most beautiful and most soothing. Whether or not these are good points for you, "Pokemon 4Ever", has still entertained many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points mentioned above, this Pokemon film contains good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The movie's theme is represented in a good way, and Team Rocket (the comic reliefs / rogue) ends with pretty good gags and ends up being more protagonists than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> As always, the shortcomings are the rather unnecessary violence and action, and baddie is rather uninteresting, even more than a few Pokemon film injuries. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is being tracked by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A young boy tries to save the pokemon, and it takes him somewhere ... Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty come into a big forest ... curious? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and "American" anime movie fans, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
