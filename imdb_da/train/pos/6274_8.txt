I went to watch this movie with a bunch of friends one night. I couldn't really hear much about it. So I didn't expect anything. But when I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the casting were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribissi's actress needed a little perking up. But such a small mistake, it could be neglected. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief to boost 60 rare and exotic cars at night to save his brother's life. The movie is by no means predictable. So the end will be a surprise. Think it's just another fast driving movie? Now you are partially right. There is much more to it. Everyone should watch this movie.
