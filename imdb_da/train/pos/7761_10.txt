*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and considered quite racy at that time, Douglas Sirks over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing. The plot is about an oil-filled dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very moving and vulneable performance, and his sluty sister Marylee played in extreme fashion by Dorothy Malone . Mrs. Malone's performance is telegraphed to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us his feelings, which are mainly lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in movies that first enter a room's eyes. Don't make me wrong now, her performance is absolute, and is one of the top camps operating in the 1950s. But it is also terrible, because as smooth and attractive as Malone is, she is not a very good actress and she is not capable of subtle or shadow. Her performace is of a note. She gets to do an evil Mambo, and in a big montage, like a loving father played by the always good Robert Keith, falls to his death, climbs a staircase, Sirk blends it with an almost surly Malone who makes a orgasmic dance while she is dressing. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) & Malone (who won the prize but shouldn't have) are the real stars of the movie, those who put the whole hysteria, both sexual and otherwise in motion, while Hudson & Bacall fall to gray and Brown, which is the color they mainly cost in. Hudson, who was a better actor, then got credit for playing childhood and best friend of Stack's, and the stalked love interest in malone's moaning & groaning over rock through most of the movie. But Hudson wants no part of her, and instead is in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy & no one is happy for a very long time. The Stack-Bacall marriage falls apart a great deal of time after a year, and Stack drinks a lot in oblivion because he thinks he's sterile and can't give Bacall a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, a very intelligent man, had a long and fascinating film and theater career in Germany, joined his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of intense vibrant "women's movies" or melodrama. Although mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material, they were masterpieces of the genre in Sirk's hands. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he brought to play in these films that filled his wide-open spaces with characters that played their emotional lives among peculiar color combinations and lighting, created faith shadows and lots of mirror reflections. In "Written" the characters always look out of windows, listen to doors or sneak around. So, in the end, after much violence, an unfortunate murder, an abortion, and more, Sirk ends the film with a final and sensational scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone into a human-edged suit sitting at a desk meeting a miniature oilwell.
