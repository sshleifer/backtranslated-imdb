Four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a distant forest area to hunt for a bear. The motley coed group runs by the crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (an efficiently eerie depiction of Alberto Mejia Baron), who, surprisingly, doesn't take kindly to any stranger on his terrain. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III tells the poignant story at a steady pace, generates a great deal of nerve strain and delivers a great deal of graphic work with the brutal killer pieces (an unpleasant neckline and a hand blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite cruel splatter highlights). The talented cast provides all solid performances, with particularly commendable work by Pedro Fernandez as the cozy, humane Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as the feisty Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the gracious Charly and Tono Mauri as antagonistic jerk Mauricio. Even better, both beautiful blonde Marisol Santacruz and the lovely brunette Adriana Vega live some tasty eyelashes by having sleek swimwear. Antonio de Anda's smart, agile filmography, breathtaking silver scene, Pedro Plascencia's robust, appalling, tremendous score, well-developed characters and the pleasantly tight'n'trim 76-minute maturity enhance the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror / action hybrid winner.
