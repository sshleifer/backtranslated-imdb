I remember seeing that this is its original aeration in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoys this. I recently had the opportunity to see it again, for the first time since then, when it was broadcast on "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I had forgotten most and some of it was aimed at children, but it was still fun. I can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
