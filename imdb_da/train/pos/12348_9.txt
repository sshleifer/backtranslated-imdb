It helps immensely if you are familiar with the culture and time period during which this movie takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, they are oiran (prostitutes) in the Yoshiwara-type "green houses", approx. 1860, giving or taking. This should help clear up some details that can be confusing to the ignorant. The film deals with problems of loyalty, love, and perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and others in their immediate surroundings. It plus the monstrous photography along with the ghostly beautiful music makes it a wonderful trip. Just put it in, suspend your disbelief and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
