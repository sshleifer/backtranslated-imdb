Sentinel is a film that was recommended to me many years ago by my father and I have seen it many times since. It always manages to entertain me, at the same time as it is also effectively scary. Flashback scenes are what really made it for me. Cristina Raines' father drives around all crazy, with the two creepy women, always able to send shivers down my spine. It's your typical good vs evil, but at least it manages to be entertaining. The end I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history. It has lots of shock and excitement as Burgess Meredith does her thing like Chazen, had me on the edge of my seat. Sentinel has the perfect buildup of tension. We are never quite comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know that something terrible is always waiting for her, and that made things more exciting. This movie is often neglected among horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all Horror fans to be happy. Performances. Cristina Raines has her woodwork, but mostly came in a big way. She is beautiful to look at, and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a girlfriend Michael. He had an instant screen presence and I couldn't help loving him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or small comos. Burgess Meredith is amazing as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we find out is scary. Eli Wallach & Christopher Wlaken are doing well, like the bumbling detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a chilling scene that I will not destroy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is an effective Horror movie, which Horror fans, unfortunately, tend to neglect. It will give you the excitement and the scares you need to be satisfied. Worth to look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
