seriously i loved this movie .. i was starting to read the book and i loved it ... the way everything was created and everything had a purpose ... i think this movie did well because Louis Sachar wrote the script. .and of course Andrew Davis ... instructed Shia Lebouf for a great performance for his first movie ... the story is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it looks a lot like the book .. i find this movie not least boring ... i absolutely loved it ... and i urge anyone to read the book. All in all, this movie is very well composed and carefully crafted ... two thumbs up for me in every single way
