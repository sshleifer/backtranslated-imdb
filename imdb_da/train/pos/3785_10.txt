This film is very undervalued. It is very imaginative, creative and wise. It's simply fun, and in my opinion this movie tops the first. But the movie was forgotten when it first came out and was even more overlooked when the years went by. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem might be that this movie was just released a few years late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already saw "the 80s". Although the 80s were only a few years back, music and style for children had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses music along with their 80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think this is a big reason why the film was bombed on ticket office. No one, but surfers still said things like "excellent!" and "false!" In 1991. "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90s, had a similar fate to be a good movie that bombarded at the cash register because it was also associated with the 80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was a much faster change than now with the '90s and' 00s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, while right now, 2002 and last year 2001 still looks / looks like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent Adventure", which was made in 1988, was released IT YEAR Instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was made quickly and published in 1989, it would also have been as wildly received as the first.
