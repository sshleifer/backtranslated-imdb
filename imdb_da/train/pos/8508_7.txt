Richard Dix decided to retire, and so Michael Duane took the place of playing the role of Ted Nichols, meeting with a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley, (Lenore Aubert). This couple only knew each other for two days, and they decided to get married by a judge of justice and it pours rain when they pull up to the judges' home and find that he is not home and does not return until next day. As the couple is inside the house, you see one and one lift the engine's hood and take a car part from the engine. When you see this event happening, you realize that this couple is in for a great surprise and the creatures of history to reveal a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley, and so poor Ted Nichols starts with lots of trouble and no marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
