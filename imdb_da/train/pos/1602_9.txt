I bought the video quite late in my collection and would probably have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. It always replaces something else on these "Cosmo's moon" nights. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their prizes, but this is truly a flawless ensemble performance of a fantastic script. What? You don't know what a "Cosmo's moon" is?
