The year 2000 had been a bad year for Indian movies because of the lack of quality and imagination of film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing came out. CCCC had a lot of contradiction because of the funding of the movie, and this by not really knowing what the movie is about, has generated good advertising and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and abroad. The only information provided was that it was an exciting thriller. The film is now released in 2001, and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot has to do with surrogacy and is well managed. Salman and Preiti give a good performance where Salman does not actually take is a t-shirt at all. Maybe be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but it is a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti, who plays the Prostitute, who eventually becomes a surrogate mother. The three main drivers confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on-screen and off-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent in playing a serious role in the movie as a successful businessman, is a shame that is exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films, as he is quite undervalued in the Mumbai film industry, partly because of the films he chooses. Rani's Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute to the end ... this is kept from her and the rest of the family ... the rest you need to find out as it will ruin the movie if I told you. The songs are all pictured well especially the dekhne walon and the main title song. The other support actors make a minimal but fine effort as Salman's loving family. Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactically .. I say, go and see it or rent it, whatever you prefer!
