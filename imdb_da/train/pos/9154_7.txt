Very good except for the finish which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The writing was very good as was the actor. The visuals were often very grainy, but somehow it was added to the movie, as the snow-covered features were good places that helped create mood in the direction of the film. This influence was destroyed by the incredibly incredible end. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8 out of 10, but the end hit it down a point to 7 because it seemed to deviate radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced to end in order to make the filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was much better than movies with much larger budgets and seemed to be filmed as a home video with some extras. Not much in the way of special effects, as these go, but for excitement it was very good.
