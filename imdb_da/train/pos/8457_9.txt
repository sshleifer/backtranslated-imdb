Gundam Wing for me happens to be a good anime. A little slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but above all enjoyable. Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "wings", I admit I've seen all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there were some problems with the story, and a few characters seem to be "rip-offs" (ie Zech's Marquise to the original Gundam Char), but this is an alternative universe show based on the original series that is SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, be sure to see the original Gundam first, and then know that you are seeing an AU series.
