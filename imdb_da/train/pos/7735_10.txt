An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - spoiled ex-boxer was drifting, alcoholic widow with creepy desires, ex-cop turning small quakes and a kidnapping plot destined for judgment. Still, the film never crosses clicheland, but remains fresh and exciting. The performances are all amazing, especially Bruce Dern's role as the evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty about the motion of the film, which deliberately or not adds the ugly procedure. Highly recommended.
