As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman produces an effective film about Man's fierce side in DELIVERANCE, no doubt a definite horror movie from the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox depict four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee river in northern Georgia before dusting up what Reynolds calls "a great dead lake" . /> But the local mountain people are taking a painfully obvious dim view of these "city boys" running through their forest. And the following day, Beatty and Voight continue across the river and become sexually assaulted (the movie's infamous "SQUEAL!" Sequence) by two evil mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). Thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians, has now become a nightmare where our four main characters are going to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey customized the manuscript from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for its "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjo's" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also the right pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men outstanding in their roles, and McKinney and Coward make for two of the most frightening villains of all time. A must-see movie for those who are willing to take a chance.
