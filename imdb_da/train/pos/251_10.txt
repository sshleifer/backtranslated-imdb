"Had Ned Kelly been born later, he would probably have won a Victoria Cross on Gallipolli." That was Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in the country of Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and recognized immediately. he is still a hero, Jeremiah's blood of life depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they still have not forgotten that the three police officers he murdered were from there. <br /> Many of the buildings he Visited in his life still stands. From the old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged to the post office, he stood up in Jerilderie. A cell he once held in Greta is exhibited in Benella and the place of Ann Jones' Hotel , the station and even the beams where he was caught in Glenrowan can be visited. <br /> <br /> Evidence of all the events in the movie (except his love interest) can be found anywhere in Victoria, in police stations and even in Sash, as Ned was assigned to save Dick Shelton from drowning this is wrong and what has been released would further justify NED's actions. The horse, which Ned "stole," was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man who Ned throws with after he has left prison). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he could not have stolen it. <br /> <br /> Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been said before. It is not self-consciousness, it is Ned's biography, an overview of what he stood for and who he protects. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and find as good what Ned stood for.
