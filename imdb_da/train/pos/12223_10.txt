I saw True Crime when it was first released back in the mid nineties and I've seen it many times since. It's a marvelous mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in a Californian town, whom the classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cad who sees how bright she is, and decides to work together to try to find the killer. Many suspects in this. True Crime feels very "true" or true to me. I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, just like the other actors. The location is right, and author / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after seeing the pictures she took from Tony). I wish Verducci wanted to make more movies. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other movie like True Crime. 10.10
