Of course, the average "Sci-Fi" Battle Star Gallactica fan will pull this down. It kind of makes me happy. I don't like the cheesy sci-fi shows, especially Battle-star Gallactica, and so I love this show. <br /> <br /> Creator's creators got a lot of heat to do this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. I read at Wiki that they wanted to appeal to everyone including women and not just sci-fi nerds. This is probably the most promising show since Lost. It has the most interesting, clever and deepest script of any show for some time, and it is truly unique. What I love most about the show is that it plays like a great anime! From young teens running around firearms, to extremely well balanced and complex scripting to robots, it reminds me of something that came from Japan, except a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
