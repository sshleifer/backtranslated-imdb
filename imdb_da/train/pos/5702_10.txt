I do not expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it was not the porn legend himself. In fact, the whole cast has performed amazing performances in this very underrated movie. As previously mentioned, find the two disc sets and watch the "Wadd" movie first; It will give you a lot of background on the story, which will be useful to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem dissatisfied with the inclusion of the LAPD crime scene on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why it could have been included, one being that John Holmes's murder trial was the first ever in the United States where such recordings were used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; It is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
