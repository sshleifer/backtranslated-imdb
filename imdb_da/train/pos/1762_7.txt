Okay, here's the deal: If you are slightly offended, you might be far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I've probably blushed around as much as I laughed. In fact, red I probably more than I laughed. And if I wasn't blushing red on the outside, then I blush on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that scares you, then you simply have no shame. Whether or not it is an honorary mark, it is in the eyes of the container I suppose. <br /> <br /> I won't deny that I laughed a little but it's a movie I simply can't give a carpet recommendation because of its subject. If I were to say, "This movie is fun, go check it out!" and some sweet little old church-headed lady leads to the theater and has a heart attack in one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need in my conscience. <br /> <br /> So how bad is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Frankly speaking. My mother would have gone out during the first scene. I feel it is my duty to warn you at least what to expect. There is a smart intelligent comedy here, but that's what I expect of the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all about making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard is white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaims, "If I hear Ya Mo be there once, I will burn Ya Mo this place," is hilarious, but that is one of the things that the majority of the audience will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing together for Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for two minutes after the joke was over while most chuckled and then forgot the. <br /> <br /> Nicely, despite the reality, there is an admirable morality to history. The movie does not show Carrell as a freaky loser, just because he is a virgin. He is really portrayed as a sympathetic, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. He has a framed Asia poster, "more video games than an Asian child" and a toy collection containing Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we never believe that there is actually anything wrong with being a virgin. As strange as it may seem, there is a bit of a "it's OK to wait". <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, be warned that this pushes its R-rating as far as it can go. It was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just lets some of the boys (especially Rogen and Malco) confuse and talk as they usually speak, all to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can do it or talk that way yourself then you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But I am. As I said, there are some very hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they are worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you will ever see in the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what is being discussed by men while playing poker. Honest ladies, you might not know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think the guys are brutal, it gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be it your guide. It should certainly not be seen with your Sunday school class, mama, grandmother, family members of the opposite sex, children of all ages or anyone easily suffering from excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you want to see it with any of the above, you apparently have no concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.
