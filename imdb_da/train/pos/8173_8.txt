The brilliance of this film is that even a competent dentist is quite scary. It is one of man's primary fears. This movie is the nightmare picture that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-dull performance as a crazy dentist, whom I think is trying to kill people, but he only works on their teeth so it doesn't work really well. In a particularly horrifying scene, we find the so-called actor Earl Boen who has completely destroyed his teeth with exercises and what not, as I think, is the absolute worst thing you can do when you are a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written, but there are many. The reason is shoddy and at times seems to be made on the spot, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we've all thought of it, but they did it first.
