In Mexico, this movie was only broadcast in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of a good German and especially a good man. The conversation between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor is particularly interesting. A true idea 'war: two different Germans, both believing who believe. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, lover, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is excellent as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommended this movie, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and heritage, this is a good job of saving a forgotten hero.
