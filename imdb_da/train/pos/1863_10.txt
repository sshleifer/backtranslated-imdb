ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young emotionally troubled US Navy sailor. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems stem from his childhood education. <br /> <br /> Get ready to throw a tear or two. The movie could thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story, which turns away from something so terrible to happen to someone at a positive end. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful movie, most importantly forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are child abuse, adoption, and care. <br /> <br /> The Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, makes an impressive job in his director's debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy checking out the giant sized pancakes!) And the end (dreams turned into reality) that beautifully tied the story together. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene arose when the doctor called Antwone to seek his family to find answers to his questions about his family leaving him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to directorial responsibilities, Mr. Washington shows why he won an Oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for that part of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed very real and heart-pulling work. Joy Bryant, who played part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, looked like a sunbeam on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic figures. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played part of Mrs Tate, despised, deserves special mention. Although we only see her In a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother happened to be an outstanding achievement. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANSWER FISHER.
