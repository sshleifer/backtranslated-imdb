I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his best actor Oscar for this movie with a three-part split among Mutiny on the Bounty leaders of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, all of whom were in the same race. But The Informer is still a great movie because John Ford would not have gotten his first best director Oscar, if it wasn't. No split involved in his price. The film and story from Liam O'Flaherty that it is based on, entails a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republican army. He was discarded by it for some impeccable stunt he withdrew and desires. He's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in, he wants enough to pass to America. There is a 20-pound reward for information that leads to the arrest of a former comrade, Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the black and thin constable and informs about McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is very eager to find out who knocked McPhillip out and they are pretty sure it was McLaglen. He doesn't have the joke to really cover his own tracks. He is making a serious effort to imply another man named Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also records a hang-on which is played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The overall act of The Informer takes place in Dublin in 1922 from about six in the evening to early morning. Of necessity, it shot in the dark and shadows, allowing the first noir thriller. Had it been done after World War II the informant would have ranked as a great noir classic, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, as it seems very similar. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time during the uprising and was in Ireland at that time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before being attacked was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays the IRA commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and deeper man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give film fans some acclaiming interests. He makes it clear that Foster will eliminate the informant because Black and Tans will take him and get a lot more out of him and put the whole organization at risk. <br /> <br /> The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the movie. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek is unable to say no. The king's justice and writer do not run here. It illustrates graphically at this point despite the occupation of armies and constable, the British actually bragging their grip on the population. Of course, Inform is a rather wicked story that has its John Ford touches, but rather fewer than you would expect. Although McLaglen spends his money on a drunk spree, the IRA is constantly in the shadows and looks at him and counts every time. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a tale that tells of Ireland in a bleak and gloomy time.
