Excellent film, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Captures wonderful everyday life in a small central city in Finland, people's wishes and weaknesses, pleasures and sorrows. The bright, early autumn sunshine creates a cool atmosphere for this clear study of people in a welfare society. Lampela is actually one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make gripping films without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila is also worth seeing, though the story of cleaning women struggling for their jobs is not as universally appealing as the fate of Joki.
