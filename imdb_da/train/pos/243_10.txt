Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, acting is amazing, all technical (especially movies) are sharp and the manuscript is wise. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He grabs as the legendary ban, and is well supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are on point <br /> <br /> The movie is edge-of-your-seat stuff right up to the end. One of my favorite films from the late legend Heath Ledger, which has been the highlight of every movie he has recorded. And make no mistake here. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie around.
