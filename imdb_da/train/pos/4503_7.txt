This zippy and fun card from 1916 - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - has the young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-do-well who must quickly impress his rich uncle by producing one wife and baby for his visit. Of course it doesn't go smoothly, and soon there are quite a few wives and babies than he can handle; plus the mandatory chases and misconceptions characterized by early movie slapsticks. <br /> <br /> Well restored it can be seen as part of 'The Early Films of Oliver Hardy' and is now available on DVD, a nice addition to the available corpus of the big screen favorite comedy duo.
