Bill Paxton, Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame surprise me with his debut as director of Frailty. He hits all cylinders, but there is a discrepancy near the end involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth) who draws a point from this otherwise chilling and thought-provoking thriller. Apart from that, this movie was just fine. Bill Paxton plays father. He never got a first name, but it's not a weakness in the movie. It actually strengthens the film, so the viewer sees him as a kind of symbol of some sort. He has a vision one day, as he says, was sent from God telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) have to kill the demons and kill them. The demons look like normal people they are killing, and it makes the seer wonder if Dad just lost his mind, or does he really do God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that add to the confusion and give the movie more excitement. The story is told in flashback by one of the grown-up sons (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks to the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and right. It is not every day that someone enters your office to tell you he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The movie has many twists, and Bill Paxton conducts brilliantly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The action is incredible. The two young leads and Paxton work well together and look like a normal family, even though they are all involved in murder. As I said, there is one implausibility involving Powers Booth's character, but it's really not a big thing. This was a very suitable movie that involved faith and family.
