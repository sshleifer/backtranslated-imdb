The action in this movie was amazing. As an amateur racket I found very few errors. As a human, it touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you think they are the actual characters. Laura Dern, one of my favorite actresses, left nothing out of her performance. The young actors who played the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired the eternal love relationship between a father and a son, so it felt right. If you do not get a lump in your throat or throw a tear when the first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, get your heart rate controlled (you may be dead).
