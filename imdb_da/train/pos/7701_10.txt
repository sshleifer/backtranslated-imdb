This has always been one of my favorite films, and it will always be. Over the past few years I have become a 50s / 60s Sci-fi freak, trying to gather all the better ones that were made then. I love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were. The beautiful colors and sets make me go too. It's a shame when they restore some of those good old movies; they almost always empty it - just look at the recent reuse of the day the earth stood still, it's complete garbage! Forbidden Planet is one of the benchmark footage all the time, and now they are trying to recreate it too, and I shake to think how the new one is! In my opinion, some things, like fabulous classic movies, should just be alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people a thrill in the process. When they add all the techno-crap we have available now, the movie just seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing at all. By the way, I note that the astronauts' uniforms in the Forbidden Planet were also used for "Queen of Outer Space"! It just tells you that the budgets were a little lower back, didn't they? Hi, less money and better movies, hmmm .... Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors), Earl Holiman, and of course Robby Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing and the story is not too far taken. This is a fantastic sci-fi experience!
