When I found this movie in my local video store, I expected to be another cheesy American vampire movie in the same vein of "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise "That Die for" is a really good movie. It is a little bit corny at times, but there are still plenty of stylish set pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. This is a perfect blend of romance and horror and it is surprisingly gory to times.Highly recommended.
