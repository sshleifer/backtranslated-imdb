Armageddon PPV <br /> The Last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown Tag. Match Results Forward ******** <br /> We start the show with The Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. This was an okay fight. Nothing about wrestling here. It was about visuals. Overall, it was not bad. There were a few dense spots here when Kane came too close to the fire, but eventually Kane won with apt MVP in the fire first. <br /> <br /> Nice opens. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new battle for the hold's title titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM I LADER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match to: Fatal four-way ladder match. This was a total carnage. Judging by three out of the four teams here, you'd expect chaos. The stains were amazing. A total spot party. One point Jeff went to poetry in motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterwards, Jeff is put on top tops with two ladders nearby when the MNM was to kill Jeff, Matt saves and Jeff hit "see-saw" shots at Joey Mercury! Mercury is damaged. His eye closes quickly and is busted openly. Mercury is out of the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor grabbed London and suplex him face-first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killed place, dropkicks through the ladder to spike Jeff! Fantastic! In the end, London and Kendrick keep the tag's hold titles. What a fight !!! <br /> <br /> It was insane. I can't figure out why WWE didn't announce this so far. The buyrate would rise enormously. I'm sure the playback value will be good though. <br /> <br /> Mercury has suffered a broken nose and lacerations to the eye. He's in the hospital now. Get good baby. <br /> <br /> No way anything else here will top. <br /> <br /> Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This was no match. Will Boogeyman always fight? Mizen also sucks. After an insane crowd, this kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong fight. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a super super at some point! Benoit hit eight German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship match. This was a good game. Unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care about this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and struggled well. I agree with JBL. He ran to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or come out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug party, with a few exceptions. Kennedy at one point threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The end point was Taker Tombstone Stoned Kennedy on the link and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They both work hard. Yet Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should have lost. Creative turned up again. <br /> <br /> A stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not this. Torrie was at least not here. It's refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. Next. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also no match. The focus was on Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay is trying to make Cena look good. The final was bleached. Finlay hit Batista knees with a shots shot and Batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. Lame. No main calibration at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match was the biggest event here. It was worth the money right there. A few others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: A good PPV with the ladder fight as the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show but is not convincing enough. Smackdown must stop letting Cena tag together. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show shows that Smackdown can.
