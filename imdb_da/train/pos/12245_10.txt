This is the best Emma that exists in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996), which is also good and reads the book, I believe I can certainly say with certainty that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just that it's almost like a completely different story. It's very light and fluffy, you don't see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want a comfortable movie, it'll do fine, but the intricacies of some of the plot points that Churchill / Fairfax entanglement is so glossy about be almost non-existent. But if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more genuine and multidimensional, the 1996 TV version is the superior one. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawless. Kate Beckinsale is masterful in showing the character's little quirks. You see her gaze randomly disgusted by one of the simpler conversations with Harriet Smith, but she shows no remorse for destroying Harriet's suggestion until that act has the effect of destroying her own marital happiness at the end. You see her narcissism and it reflects Frank Churchill because they would hurt others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​it played matchmaker and had a new friend to stay away from having suffered the loss of her governor for marriage. For Frank Churchill, the promise of the woman he loves is assured while treating her and others abominable to keep the secret. In the book, she discovers all this in a swelling awakening to all the blunders she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse, but Paltrow is more childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is quite genuine and serious, and you see the transition from childish, selfish behavior to friendly and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
