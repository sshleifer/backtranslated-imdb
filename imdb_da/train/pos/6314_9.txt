I went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of hat without knowing what to expect. And it turns out to be a very enjoyable, dead-laughing experience! It is an excellent movie with very unexpected history, very good dialogues and crazy humor. Of course, all characters are made in "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical cartoon) style, but it hasn't bothered me for a second. In fact, this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, also Willian Macy, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But real star is actually Guzman. He has played his role in this movie! The scene, when his character Cosimo dies in the film, is so funny that it made me stiff and almost die with him! Recommended for all fans of Alan Ford!
