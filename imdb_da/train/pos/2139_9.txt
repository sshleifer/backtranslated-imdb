I nurtured this movie with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done, and it puts its hands down in ballroom dance films of recent years, especially "Strict Ballroom". While the music is beautiful and dancing colorful, it's not about me dancing. It's about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commute to work and leisure after work for entertainment that doesn't involve their families. Here we have the man with the whole family and the big mortgage loan and a flagship for life. He is attracted to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he is passing during his commuting, and it causes him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motifs that started their new passion are clear but somehow accepted, at least eventually by family and audience. Attitudes towards ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are certainly non-western, although the discipline and music are clearly cultural imports into Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus exciting. Even without the cultural insight, the color, dance and enthusiasm of the players all make it a fun movie to watch.
