Sensible, soft talk by Steven Spielberg was his first real venture in this genre. Due to Alice Walder's Pulitzer award-winning novel, the story of a young girl's arranged marriage deals with adversity to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse, and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through continuity and Menno Meyje's scrambling script. "The Color Purple" is sometimes difficult to follow, and on one or more occasions it tends to be somewhat irregular in terms of time frame. This drop in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail that is obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that the maestro Spielberg couldn't remedy and remedy these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his skill as an instructor. <br /> <br /> The performances are strong throughout, where Whoopi Goldberg makes a debut - as she never matched the side with acting performance - as the heart broke Celie, who just longs to be loved. Danny Glover provides solid support, even though his "Moses" was an overall trip to him in "Places of Heart". Standout shows come from the unhardened Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single-minded, struggling black woman whose spirit is crushed by a horrible incident involving a condescending, over-class white woman. Good support from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) has written a beautiful melodic score and also gave some original blues to the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always while director of photography Allen Daviau shows complete skills to capture some glorious southern surroundings. <br /> <br /> This true affair in the heart will surely cause a tear to the eye, it's just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
