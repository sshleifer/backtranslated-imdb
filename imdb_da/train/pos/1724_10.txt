This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German prisoner of war, Stalag Luft III, during World War II. This is the same POW camp that was the scene of the Great Escape, which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the Gestapo (and later made for a very successful movie of the same name). <br /> <br /> While the other POWs in Stalag Air III are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up to build a wooden whale horse. which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they had to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea of ​​building their version of Trojan horses came to them as they discussed "classic" attempts to escape and observed some POWs that played the jumping frog in the connection. <br /> <br /> Initially, one and later included two POWs hidden inside, the wooden horse could be performed in the junction and placed at almost the same position, close to the fence, on a daily basis. While volunteers POWS vaulted over the horse, the escapes were occupied inside the horse and dug a tunnel during the vault while they were located near the wire, under the wire and into the forest. <br /> <br /> The story also describes the dangers facing two of the three escape POWs as they traveled through Germany and occupied Europe after they had left the tunnel. All three POWs who attempted to escape actually broke home (escaped success to their home base). The wooden horse provides a very accurate and true sense of tension and events in a POW breakout. The film was shot at the actual places along the route the two POWs traveled in their flight. The wooden horse is made with far less of a budget than The Great Escape, and it is more realistic if it is no more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat that praises the POWs to make their escape good. <br /> <br /> The story is crisp and the actors are ringing right and excited enough to keep up the thrill throughout the film. The wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the fugitives, Eric Williams, and is by far the best POW flight history ever made in a movie. Some of the actual POWs were used in the movie to reproduce their existence as prisoners in Stalag Air III. I give this movie a well-deserved ten.
