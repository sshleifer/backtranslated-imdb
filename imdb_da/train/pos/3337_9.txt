This is a great movie for the true romantic and sports lovers alike. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is her best in this movie. As a Drew fan, it was quite nice to see her brilliance after having several flops. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he completely delivered as Ben the comic, sporty lover. The comedy in this movie is amazing, there were several laughs high moments. <br /> <br /> His first date started rocking as he appeared on her flowered apartment and she was sick in the stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day. Instead of leaving, he helps take care of her and helps her change in pajamas and then clear the puck on her toilet and bathroom later to tell her she was "very lady-like ... no lumps . " Everything goes well between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to realize how obsessed Ben is with the Red Sox, and why this seemingly beautiful guy is still single. She's trying to get rid of it and think of it as a good thing, as she has a busy work schedule, and she won't be guilty of working extra hours while in play. She even buys all the books on The Red Sox she can find, including one about the 'Band of Curse'. <br /> <br /> Everything goes fine until Lindsay has a false alarm that has missed its period. It both makes them aware of how serious they are, and she begins to question whether it is the person she wants to join. A very touching part of the movie is, after she tells him she got her time, it shows him, unfortunately, to put a baby size Red Sox jersey he had bought just if she was pregnant. <br /> Finally, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friend's birthday party after she said "I had to check my calendar and when I saw that there was one Red Sox / Yankee games, I knew I would go to deer. " After the party Ben tells her that it was 'the best night in her life'. Shortly after, he received a call from his buddy who went to the game, he went up to the party and told him, "THERE WAS THE BEST GAME NEEDED !!!" Ben freaks out to miss it and ends up really hurting Lindsay when she says "A few minutes ago you said it was the best night in your life" he says "yes it was a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> So they separate for a while, he realizes how immature his occupation is and decides to sell his season tickets that he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't, remind him too much of what he gave up for them '. Lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him from realizing that he is doing it for her. It ends very sweetly to show how his childhood love for baseball has been overshadowed by a whole new deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and even participate in the final World Series game and St. Louis, and it's a happy ending all around. 2 thumbs up !!
