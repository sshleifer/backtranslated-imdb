Coinciding, annoying and unbelievable, Fay Grim is hard to sit through, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. She touches immediately, funny, cunning. The supporting actors commit to it too. <br /> <br /> I won't even try to tell you the plot. It involves characters from Hartley's Henry Fool and tries a tale of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue with it - understand it. In a way, quite ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod together. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous movie-goer willing to tackle something that is not cookie-cutter. Eventually, it gives something that can withstand description.
