I was really surprised at this movie. Going into the sneak preview, by not knowing anything about the movie except the one trailer I had seen, I thought it should be a guy. Where's my car kind of crap party. I was expecting bad sex jokes and speed and a pathetic lead character that will be put in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead, I got a clever surprising original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of sex jokes and vulgarity and occasionally hey-look-a-nipple! but it's done a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeeming friends who just try to hang a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie would be a total crap and I was very surprised. Yes, it's right over the top (c'mon, it's a 40-year-old virgin movie!), But it's very cleverly done. <br /> <br /> Finally, you're really pulling this guy to be laid, who says a lot about the movie because honestly, you really didn't care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
