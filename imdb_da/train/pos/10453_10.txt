While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to stay together in Austria. Next morning, Jesse returns to the US and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, in fact one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It's a low-budget movie with a very simple and genuine story, but chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect and the dialogue is great. The direction is fantastic and transmits the feeling of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just finished my review number 1000 in IMDb and I choose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number because it's a very special movie to me. I can't understand why this film was not nominated for Oscar with such a grand script, direction and performances. Yesterday I have probably seen this movie in the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
