The biggest reason to watch this movie was that of the stars Susan Swift, an excellent and far too underappreciated actress. Time-traveling movies usually do not interest me, nor do witchcraft movies, but this film was fascinating and scary. It was not dependent on outrageous special effects, and it did not focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer lost and confused. This was a truly creative film that was kept simple and focused with great plays by everyone.
