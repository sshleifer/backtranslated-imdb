I would not have known about this movie, if not for its "surprise" Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature movie. Fortunately, it happened that I was able to see this animated little treasure. The story is about the child Brendan, who was the nephew of the impressive and over-protective Abbot in Kells town. The primary pre-recording of the abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the famous Iona illustrator, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of art and locally entices. Along the way, Brendan found himself with the white forest spirit Aisling when he tried to restore an old crystal that was invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the animation, "The Secret of Kells" is released these days. It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are made in sharp geometric lines and designs without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic, yet fluid animation style used at the beginning of "Kung Fu Panda". However, it is the magnificent use of color, which is the greatest source of entertainment for the public. The reds used in the Viking invasion are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this quiet gem of a movie. It's a welcome deadline from all the pointless bombast of current animated fares like "Monsters vs. Aliens" and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective at evoking the sensation of imagination that recreates the movie. Okay, the story can be a little low and it ends a bit. I would like to know more about the book that Brendan and Aiden worked on. But the clear star of this movie is obviously its amazing stylized work of art that is said to be based on the work of the real Book of Kells.
