A country-boy Aussie-Rules player (Mat) goes to the city the night before a very important AFL trial match, where he has to be picked up by his cousin. And then it goes wrong. <br /> <br /> His non-hopping cousin has been mixed up into a drug deal involving local loan shark / drug dealer Tiny (which resembles any gangster anywhere but is finally Australian). Needless to say, food is disturbed in the chaos, and it is not long before the thoughts of tomorrow's struggle are shunted to the back of his mind as the hectic events of the night rage. <br /> <br /> Performed Western Australian Professional Shakespeare actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as a young naive country-boy Mat, and successfully plays a lot far below his age. Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role of David Ngoombujarra as one of the police after the events. The role is fast, often fun, and a very worthy one-hour use.
