I saw "The Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies and I really liked this one. There were so many surprise scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump into your seat. Although too much public screaming made it hard to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus when the face flashes at the window or when Yoko goes without the chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you could really see that it was, but it still added a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good, so sweet without make-up and looked terribly scary with it. The next time I hear a smashing noise, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
