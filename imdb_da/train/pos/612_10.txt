This remarkable movie can be summed up very easily. First of all, while comparisons to "Princess Bride" are unavoidable, it is almost impossible to do so. While both films combine adult humor and humor with a fairy-tale background, "Stardust" is so much different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It is such a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and script is so unique that - along with the performances, special effects, cinematography and score - the finished product is simply not all that can be compared to anything that has ever been on silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously drawing us into the story and fantasy world where it takes place and pushes the story together, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement needed to make the magic credible within for the wealth where signs exist. Third, I did not find the movie to be just externally difficult to follow or confuse in any way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main subgroups made it much more convincing to see. Wonderfully casted, and excellently traded across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best I've seen since the "King's return" (not that I compare the two at all). OK, so it's not that easy to summarize, but don't let any rough and / or heartless and cynical review or the movie's pathetic PR prevent you from participating in the best time you could have on film this summer (or even for a long time time)!
