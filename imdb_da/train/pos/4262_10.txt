Saw it as many times as I could before it left the scene. A nice and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. Only wish I could find it again! Would definitely buy / see it if I could. Please bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Gardens were beautiful and charming. It was a musical but also romantic, fun and smart. This was my favorite movie with June Gardens, though I always liked her. Her dazzling smile lit up on the screen, and her beauty and talent was an asset to any movie. Support support lent credit to their individual roles. A well balanced and light hearted film; Only wish we had more it!
