Tommy Jones and Matt Dillon make the gambling world proud. The various movements with the wrists had to be learned since throwing craps is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I fully expected the 'good girl' to cry over his grave, instead of his buddy. Especially with her remarks about "going to his best friend's funeral" when she first meets Matt. And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allen's face, dazzling him (interesting role of Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood finishes are happening, but the writing is so brilliant, it is so careful that you are blissfully ignorant. <br /> <br /> The music is out of this world. Taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first released by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a small racism rages its ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called wonderful, 'Biloxi' with a Confederate flag supporting the racist remarks. I want to see it again, just to hear the music. Well, I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack so I can listen to it in the car. See both together and you will see how Matt has matured .... playing bar space signs in both. When he owns a bar in Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has a good opportunity to make his studies. Great actress, just get into his own. He shows fine nuances ... the good and the bad in his characters. His 'young boy from the farm' is a great study that has been made particularly exciting because of his bassett-dog eyes. He also loves convincingly. When he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how it ... loves an actress you just grew up with. Add conviction, I say.
