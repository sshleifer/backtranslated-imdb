First and foremost for this movie, I just have a word: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best movies that touched me, from its story to its performances, so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with this last because he really brought the depth to the character as it was a very tough role. But the two formed a couple that surprised me from the beginning to the end, and showed in the way, a friendship filled with love that evolves all day, settled in the movie. The story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long, but finally we are compensated with a wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have the chance, see it, because it is a movie that will stay in your mind for many years. Simply amazing - 9/10.
