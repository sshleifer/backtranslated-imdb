Joseph H. Lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir. This is definitely his best. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have any of the standard features of what we now call movie noir. Although it is American-made, it is entirely in England. It lacks gangsters. It lacks a femme fatale. It does not lack crime. <br /> <br /> The title character answers an ad. She is happy that she will make some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes days later as the farmer in a scary plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a frightening disturbing ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from casting against type: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. She's not a screaming, cowering victim. She is actually a little ice cold and patrician, albeit inappropriate. This makes her character's sake more credible. <br /> <br /> The only most fascinating element is certainly the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and is) most famous for the charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes." She has a sweet way and a harmless, slightly dithering way. But here she is far from a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as his extremely worried son. The entire throw is actually amazing. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost accidentally. Without a doubt, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. It is the excitement and charm of film noir, the real film noir: It is small, convincing low life, and in this case unforgettable.
