I paused to see "Read My Lips", a plate of liberty before me. The food was quickly forgotten when I was excited by the director and co-author Jacques Audiard's original and amazing thriller. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a company that is developing major construction projects. In fact, she has some significant responsibilities that do not often fall to secretaries and she is capable and ambitious. And countered by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her. <br /> <br /> Working gets faster than she can handle it, Carla is told to hire a secretary. Enter ex-con and general layabout Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his skills and actually has no one that any legitimate business may require. After Paul's first serious misunderstanding regarding Carla's interest in him, the two are allies. A quirky friendship starts. In a stunt that would have made a real Carla a great contender on "The Apprentice," she trumps her selfish male opponent at work with Paul's connivance. Finish the rivalry. <br /> <br /> Carla is almost deaf without her hearing aid. With that she almost hears normally. She turns off the hearing aid to isolate itself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up effort was made to make her seem ordinary, but she is really beautiful. She doesn't have a girlfriend. She babysits so a friend can get a connection (it's a French movie) She gets harder and humiliating when she admits a girlfriend that she is hanging somewhere, while the venomous friend is having her father in Carla's bed. Not sweet. <br /> <br /> As Carla and Paul get to know each other, the suppressed noisy side of the not so previous crime appears. There is a side story of Paul's relationship with his parole officer, who nicely complements the main plot and has his own great surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" Engineer Paul acknowledges that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the entertaining couple's trick, as the first seems to be. <br /> <br /> From there, a creator develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal oddball couple. She wants love but will also accept money. He wants her, some kind, but the company must come before possible erotic satiation. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who carry an extraordinary crime story to their very end. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, go to "Read My Lips". And you may want to see it several times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
