Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans (probably all Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 50s and 60s), three of the adult actors / actresses showed up as they did for the 2000 reunion show. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter. As funny as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino together again, was it just as mysterious about the complete lack of mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? It is my understanding that Little Luke was dead in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information about Hassie on the internet that I can find. Very curious why they weren't even mentioned? It was so conspicuous, their absence from the Reunion Show, that I suppose that the family Michael and Lydia themselves (if they were still alive), 1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their wish was given or 2) TNN could not find track by either Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the look back at Walter Brennen was done wonderfully. They made no bones about it ... it was grandfather who made the show a success. I remember as a child imitating the grandfather's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as it is probably a million other kids did it again). An annoyance that afflicted me a little was the tendency for Richard Crenna to dominate the discussion ... at times, Tony and Kathleen are disturbing to make a point. In fact, even though Tony Martinez seemed completely capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and say too much during the Reunion Show. Unfortunately, as I also wanted to hear from all three. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I've seen it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
