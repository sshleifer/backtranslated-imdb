Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of it, I wasn't really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other films. There were a few laughs here and there - nothing for fun. Probably my favorite parts of the movie are when he dances in the club scene. I must try it the next time I find myself in a club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the chick from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it very fun to see a cameo look of Thandie Newton in a scene. She is, of course, in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw up, you will either enjoy it to a degree or find it a bit boring. I can add that Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
