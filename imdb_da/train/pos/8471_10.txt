This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos and I have seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming self as a deboner Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a lovely zany museum curator, the usual comic book is quite fun here, and there are many suspects who should throw their eyes. It's fast and fun. The archaeologist does not have the same flair as Thomas Beck, the usual other leader in these programmers, but he is sufficient. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while he speaks stereotypically, his lines are fun, not deterrent to his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his short time on the screen.
