SPOILERS <br /> In the word of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people". In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate how precise it can be. As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau create two good friends, respectively, who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow slowly more and more frustrated with each other, the grins come thick and fast before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar a changed and more pure individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely fantastic as the neurotic, clean-minded divorce handles life as a single man. Walter Matthau, in contrast to Lemmon's character, is as good as the Slovenian sports author who simply wants to play poker to make money for his child benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are great in their chosen parts, to some extent dependent on the beautiful script by Neil Simon, and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are inherently different in lifestyle, even though they are similar to previous wives and children, these two, late, great actors create a partnership that is virtually impossible to recreate. So big in fact, that the world screamed so much to something similar, that two years before Matthaus's death and three before Lemmon, the characters were reunited in a poorer successor. This idea, even though it followed Hollywood's annoying obsession with successors, could have worked to some extent, but at the same time it could never get close to copying the genius of this original movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is not really possible to say anything else. With Simon's amazing script filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this movie were already on a hit. Casting Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, however, is the most important part of this movie. "The Odd Couple", with the traditional soundtrack (which has even received a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is the excellent script and it is brilliant leading men, a tribute to cinema and a feature of history to remember.
