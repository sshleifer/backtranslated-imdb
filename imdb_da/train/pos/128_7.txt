Von Trier once explained how he made such a strong commitment from the viewer with his films by placing his film world around the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So, as viewers, we think we see a "true" story while we are actually being manipulated thoroughly, often to the point that the film is disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idiots). Of course, the Dogme films worked only as a means of this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlights on Von Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relationships with everyone else, but immediately becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. The idealistic must inevitably reject society in order to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Man is pampered and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (equally humorous) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in the post-war period in Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the film is wonderfully designed: changing and fading laced colors, screen overlays, action on various overlays (with the uptake of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). In this movie we can see how well Von Trier handles movies as a technical medium. In his later works, he seems to fall away from this (as if he is no longer interested in technical results because they become so readily available).
