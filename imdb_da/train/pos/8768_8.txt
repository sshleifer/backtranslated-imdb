I watched this movie in a store in the cheap section. In fact, I remembered living to see advertisements and trailer for it many years ago. I was thinking "what good" and bought it when the plot sounded interesting, and Claire Danes has always been a talent in my eyes (it was also before I became a big Kate Beckinsale fan). <br /> <br /> So it's about two girls sneaking into a holiday in Bangkok, getting busted for drugs (which they are innocent of) and then sent to a Thailand prison. The film follows what happens to them and sometimes questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale provide amazing performances and the plot of this movie unconventionally breaks and raises some good moral issues. <br /> <br /> I think it's a solid good movie, but there might have been some improvements. It could have been longer ... it would have helped to solidify these characters and more insight into Thailand's justice system policy would have helped. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a great movie with some amazing performances. <br /> <br /> PS For everything you pop-culture junkies be looking for a two-minute role of Paul Walker. I didn't even notice him the first time I saw the movie.
