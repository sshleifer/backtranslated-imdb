My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We saw it as a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad It a new Pokemon did not speak this time. I will get used to it. Iron Masked Marauder was right when he caught Celebi with his dark ball. Good thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of his control. There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE performed by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever Successful since the previous three movies and people will always love that movie.
