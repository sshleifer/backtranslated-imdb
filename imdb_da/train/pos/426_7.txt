After jumping across this movie on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday night and then worth my two cents. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it. Is each movie, good or bad, deserved more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when looking at a movie like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case at the end of the fifties. Film was pretty much a good medium again then. The cinemas were without tragedy, while the screens were filled with wide-screen Technicolor movies to decorate people away from the gray medium's glare in a box called television. I don't know how many people were primed off the boob to see this one, but I managed to catch my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) out in the country after trying to Steal a car. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed thinks he has lost his lifestyle. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick will stay on the farm, somehow will bring Jed out of his doldrums. History lines like this are what they are, Jed and Nick don't care much about each other too much of course. Jed then continues to meet with the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately develops an infatuation with Fran, and of course I do not need to tell you that Liz is developing a hug on Jed. Then there is the question of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who's got lost and won't let anyone handle him since Jed Jr's death. You could probably fill out everything that happens from that point alone, seeing how there are no real surprises. It doesn't matter, though you still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When you come across the picture of squeaky clean Pat Boone, as a presumably poor boy, you have no problem with the rest of the movies. Considering that Boone does a surprisingly good performance like Nick. Certainly, the role does not require much depth, but it is still a nicely done work when you least expect it. As Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the beginning he is unattainable and cold, but when he slowly warms to Nick, we see that he is really a really good guy. Jeannette Nolan is very fun as Henrietta, who constantly plays part of the mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets a few options to reach us with her singing talent. Like Liz, she is beautiful to look at, lovely to listen to, and quite fun at times. Dolores Michaels as Fran, a little more on the wild side, is just as entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real, medieval, boring sign of any kind on the screen. Not a true villain on the whole. Everyone is so lovely, you can't help but enjoy the movie. I honestly find it quite refreshing, like putting your problems behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with music tracks, a little more plot and wide screen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they did not fall back on using blue screen backgrounds during the horse racing sequences, and they are quite entertaining and exciting because of it. In fact, you will find the whole movie beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they didn't jump in that section. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed as any attempt in some way to make the others respect. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with the big movie theater. But sometimes instead of going to Disneyland you just need a good outing in the park and that's what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My character: B + <br /> <br />
