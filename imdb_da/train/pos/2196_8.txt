... so what's in the missing 10 minutes that was so horrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were three years in the film production code ... Barbara Stanwyck had the star play in the original game, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit television show "My Three Sons". Watch out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movie) and that for fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced almost every movie on tape. Of course he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever bias in the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie meets the tourist a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses his boat when it leaves the harbor and becomes interwoven with the soldier. The dashed 20-something Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama, where Johnson (MacMurray) has played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid the band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states. Some good songs by Lamour. Good (but short) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise, helpful owner of the local salon in Panama. While others have regretted how bad it is, it was not that terrible and even a little exotic, with the fake Central America locale setting for the first half of the movie.
