If you want a fun romp with lots of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flick. I do not understand why anyone would not enjoy this. Take it what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to row with your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and keeps herself in this - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows an ability for subtle humor. Too bad she has not had many opportunities to expand it. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits in perfectly with his role as "Real Navy," and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Throw in a walk-on of Hopper amidst the quest for "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing. I bought this as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy.
