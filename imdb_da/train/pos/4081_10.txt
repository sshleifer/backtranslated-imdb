I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's movies, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie to me. Of course, the animation is also great, and the music captures the feelings of the movie perfectly. But the characters are the shining point of this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. Now, let me explain: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it is simply in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest watching (and hearing) the movie as it was originally.
