OK, here's my personal list of top Nicktoons shows today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My teenage robot life <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a capital letter only? That means this is the Nick Show I need to talk about. "Catscratch" is basically a simple but amazingly animated comedy about three wealthy cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who gets into strange and really surreal situations, from trying to join Human Kimberly's Rodel's Sleep Party to rescue a planet of swallows from the evil spaceship. This is a Nick show that you simply want your funny leg ticked sooner or later! The theme song is captivating and memorable. Voters - including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield" franchise - bring the characters to new life with very fun personalities. The stories are pleasant (fans' episodes would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is all done in a kind of earthworm Jim. <br /> In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which become very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
