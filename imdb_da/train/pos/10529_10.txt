In no way is my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the movie almost completely lovely. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one playing 'Miss Bates' are absolutely fantastic. The period report is not alienating; In fact, the movie is just right. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. There couldn't be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are also no hindrance to enjoyment. Highly recommended. Anar
