I saw last night after not having seen it for years. It's really a funny little movie, with a bunch of faces you didn't know was in it. Arkin shines as always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed By the way, it was just released on DVD and unlike its packaging, it is widescreen. The transfer is rather poor, but at least the WHOLE film is visible. ;-)
