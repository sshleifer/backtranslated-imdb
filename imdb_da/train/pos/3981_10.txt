This is my fourth Joe McDoakes card I've seen and so far the funniest. In this, Joe takes voice education from a record that mimics Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by chance), he asks Jack Carson for directions that become both confused. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice, which is not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and comes to the set where he automatically disrupts the director. I will stop there and just say how much fun I found it all and was fascinated by the movie star cameos delivered at the end. The final scene was especially a hoot so on the note, go to YouTube if you want to see So you want to be in Picutres!
