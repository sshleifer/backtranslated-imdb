Homelessness (or homelessness, as George Carlin said) has been a problem for years, but never a plan to help them in the streets, once considered people who did everything from going to school, working or voting on the matter . Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause, while worrying about things like racism, the war against Iraq, pushing the kids to succeed, technology, the election, inflation or concern if they are about to end up in the street . <br /> <br /> But what if you got a bet to stay in the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, entertainment set, bathroom, wall pictures, a computer, and everything you once tax to see how it is to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolt's lesson. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (as leader) playing as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to bet on a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxury; If Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project to make more buildings. The game is on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cannot step away from the pavement. He has been nicknamed Pepto by a vagrant, after writing on his forehead, where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), an ex-dancer who was divorced before losing her home and her friends Sailor (Howard Morris) and Gasser (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He is not used to reaching mutual agreements, which he once did when he was rich, where it is fight or flight, killed or killed. <br /> <br /> While the love relationship between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found "Life Stinks" to be one of Mel Brook's observant films, which, prior to being a comedy, shows it a sore side compared to his slapstick work like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs for the case to show how it is to have something valuable before you lose it the next day or on the other hand make a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it as the monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
