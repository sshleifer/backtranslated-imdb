As a knowing fan, I recommend this movie as true to the facts and well acted. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new music experience that made girls scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be shed. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Shortly after vacationing with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and became the floor of the difference between it and all the songs I had ever heard until then. When I heard the album "Meet the Beatles" from my older brother, I was confused for life. After reading the final book of their beginner (at Davis), I was surprised that this film followed the facts very well with the exception of releasing most of the meat and some of the substance (the affected use of methadrin / dexadrine ). >
