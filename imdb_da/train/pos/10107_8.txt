"Ardh Satya" is one of the finest movies ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, which also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all the leading directors in India. <br /> <br /> The movie tells Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any police in other cities in India, Mumbai police includes a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical outlay with the real life state of the Mumbai Police Environment. Among other police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young, warm-blooded cop who comes from a poor family. His father is a hard police force. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and instances of his father's atrocities on his mother. Others' approach to immediate action against crime is an inert requirement for their own job satisfaction. The film is here transformed into a plot in which Anand's constant action against crime is trampled by his seniors. This leads to frustration as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction. Due to the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand room and beams and also makes him an alcoholic. The spirit in him still lives as he constantly fights for the system. He is aware of the Metro's system, where the police and politicians are inertly connected to the distant end. His compromise on unethical practice is negative. Finally, he is suspended. <br /> <br /> The direction is a masterpiece and a thorough core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks into the underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him followed by a brief conversation that is amazing. In many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments. <br /> <br /> The practical access to Script is a great punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deception are all an integral part of Mumbai police even today. These aspects are treated excellently. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the One Man show, About Puri, depicting Anand Velankar, who crosses all his feelings perfectly.
