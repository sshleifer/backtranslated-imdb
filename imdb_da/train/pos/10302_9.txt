This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey did not have her usual face making things in this movie. He was both fun and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his strength. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as an entertaining actor / actress. The reason was good because it had many sub-items in the main point. This movie can be fun (Bruce's dog) and sad ("break-up"). The script worked well too. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
