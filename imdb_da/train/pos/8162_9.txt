As Dr. Alan Feinstone turns Corbin Bernsen into a wonderfully horrible performance in "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> With its already obsessive compulsive high gear tendencies, the IRS beat him and a very suspicious actress; Dr. Alan Feinstone loses his hygiene more and more every day. <br /> <br /> When Doc realizes that his wife has an affair with the local pool kid, it sets out a series of events that lead to torture, murder, murder total chaos! The "dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relative and hate bar at the same time. Although he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy for him. That my friends ..... are wonderfully good plays. <br /> <br /> A lovely solid cast of supporting actors rounds out this gem of a movie. Excellent direction, good killing and doing, and effective pacing will keep you entertained during the movie run. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
