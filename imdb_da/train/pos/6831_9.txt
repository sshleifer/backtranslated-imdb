I only know of another movie that might compete with opening night, and that is Bergmans Persona. Both films are simply amazing, they have a wealth of ideas that are hard to understand at first glance. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life, as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she plays on stage than she would have. The unfortunate death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle, and she is so hit by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actor. She begins to ask herself questions about her aging, which begins to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But it doesn't help too much, and Myrtle is a step away from complete madness. The place where she kills the dead girl's imaginary (or not) spirit is one of the most exciting scenes I found in a Cassava movie. The movie ends with genius on behalf of the director when he plays a theater scene where he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene as Myrtle gets too full for the opening night to perform his part precisely. This scene was spontaneously filmed, with a live audience, the laughter being genuine, chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely fantastic. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers significant ideas along with good entertainment, this movie will fit you nicely.
