I was amazed at the improvements in an animated movie. If you are close to the screen, you will see the details of grass and surface structures. Detail, colors and shadows are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. How they could draw the shadow, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will give a documentary about how the film was produced so I can find out how all this was achieved. Based on this movie, I think the animated film of the future will be judged by this movie.
