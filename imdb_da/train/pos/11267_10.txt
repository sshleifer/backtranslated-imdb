Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He covers facts about history and truths that are no longer widely known. I'd like to see much more of this show. It is very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to get his points across. He explained that the person who actually traveled Paul Revere Midnight Ride was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Reveres name because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I've seen Robert Wuhl for many years, from the time he made stand-up comedy and all the way through "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I strongly recommend that you see an episode of this show. It's worth your time.
