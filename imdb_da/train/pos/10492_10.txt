I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The reason is not very complex, but it does not take away from the entertainment. It's chuck full of comic moments and has a very unique quality to it. The characters are what makes the movie so good. They each have their own ornate qualities that add to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law in mind. Excellent plays were done by everyone, especially Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were great in drawing some of the more fun moments. If you're looking for a good comedy, I'd definitely recommend this movie!
