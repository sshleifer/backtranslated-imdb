Cecil B. deMille really knew how to make a classic, and after 7 decades, his westerns come across as Real McCoy, exciting, entertaining, spectacular; in no way obsolete. As a true fan of TV's DEADWOOD, I tell Gary Cooper's performances as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane is much more on target. /> <br /> We have no giants in Hollywood anymore. The PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade who have seen continuing commercial life ten years after decade: released, reissued, reissued. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's films will be sought out in 7 months or even 70 years.
