I've watched the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voters looks very promising. I can't believe I'm saying it. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a story intertwined with his own. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and exciting stories in any animated movie. The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disy's jobs with Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality of their production. It almost vanishes them to steal the story of Kimba's white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki's film is released correctly! I can't wait to see an unknown English version of Nausicaa!
