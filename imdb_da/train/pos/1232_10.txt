Very funny movie. Classic movie fun Eddie Murphy from the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony doesn't fail, the movie is fun, well done. Murphy in the 80s made many films of action that represented him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but in 1986 movies so far have changed. The atmosphere of a movie of that time is good, and the special effects are good for a movie during the period. A great movie to watch and enjoy the taste of ironic Murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. The last part is anthologies, the sympathetic actor who plays that part of the Tibetan monk. That is it.
