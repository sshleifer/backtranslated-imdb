This film is basically a documentary for the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The philosopher's pathos are genuine and you feel the pain, grief and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'état Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> Getting away from watching this movie, Hugo Chavez is truly a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez persona individually handled the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day-old military-installed junta and restore the democratically-installed government of Venezuela. It's clear from the movie that George W Bush helped and supported the Venezuelan coup d'état. The fact that ordinary media supported and supported George W. Bush is not surprising. What is surprising how few people have seen this movie, and how few people realize the total corruption in America's mass media. <br /> <br /> It has only taken 20 years that Ronald Reagan removed the Fairness Doctrine in 1986 to make America a blind and ruthless state. <br /> <br /> May Hugo Chavez opens patriotic Americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
