Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind swordman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film, where he is allowed to love a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The great stick often used in the pursuit of justice is retired forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual scary self when he pursued those who would steal from the Treasury to borrow on usurious amounts for those who could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual great swordplay and skill of the big guy was present with the blood. <br /> <br /> I'll miss him.
