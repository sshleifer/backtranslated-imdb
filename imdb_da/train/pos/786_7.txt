Andie MacDowell's facial expression is amazing again in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or your entire life) you may feel like you're wasting away. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found everywhere if your antennas are acutely active. I liked the fast sexual encounter that should be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). Her ex-student is sweet enough, and still has a crush on her teacher. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought were rather unrealistic or impractical. For example, a mature police officer (MacDowell's second friend) in a scene where the other women's jealousy overrated and a scene was set up to get Andie MacDowell to dump the young man would allow his girlfriend to do such a horrible act? Is it so easy for anyone not to stop in front of a car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I hoped to see the heroine happily married to the first man she became involved in (it was the hardest part to believe !! For such a beautiful woman to become single for so long ??) .. . <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film producers are aware that many romances between an older woman and a younger man do not last long. In addition, they know that a happy end would not appeal to the public, especially to jealousy women over 40 who expect some miracles to happen. The sad end with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continued to live it would last? How long time? No one knows. Nevertheless, it's a movie that will make you want to see it again sometime later ... a year later maybe.
