I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the 3 best movies I've ever seen. It has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in the university can be. There are 3 main story lines, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. I was fascinated by all the stories, but the one who got me the most was the story of Kristen and fighting for his feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie 25 times plus, I still cry. I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to pay for 10/10.
