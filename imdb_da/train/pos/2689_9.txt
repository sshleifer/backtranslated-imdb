This is a warm, fun movie, just like Almodovar's works. Sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that I can't even understand the readers who found it sick or perverted (but would I be willing to leave my 10- year old son playing that part? Not so sure!). <br /> <br /> Spanish cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink. I think that if we had the same attitude in Northern European types, we would be much better off as a result. This liberal attitude is also seen in the character of the hilarious 'Fartman Maurice'. As his lover tells him, "Most people are embarrassed to talk. You make it an art form."
