Where the pavement ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another beginner <br /> <br /> This is a prototypical film noir, and as such, it is quite flawless, from both style and content points of view. The shooting and night-time settings are top notch (film photographer Joseph LaShelle lets the drama pour into scene after stage), and the close-ups face pure expressionism. I can see this kind of movie alone for the pictures, even when the actors fight and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But the play is first-class here and the plot contains what I consider to be the core of most noir films, the alienated male lead (representing the many men who return to a changed United States after the war and feel lost yourself). In fact, Dana Andrews is not only convincing as the worried, lonely detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the leading woman's (first) man, a decorated ex-GI fell on hard times and booze. The fact that one man kills the other can be of monumental significance, generally - the solid man struggles through his inner problems to success, while the medal-wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head. The woman goes from one to the other - we suppose they are married and have children as suggested earlier in the film. Although this pushes an interpretation of it after the fact, we can still see a man's path with some psychological baggage care through a crisis to the highest form of moral order - turning himself into a little crime right at the point he's actually gone with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story made just one year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook comparing and contrast session. The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon fights morally through it all and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not can explain why a man does not get his girl and the other. Gene Tierney pulls out a hugely sympathetic, discouraging and ultimately conventional and "beautiful" type of woman - not just a cardboard desirable, but someone you want Dixon to actually marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is effective enough in its game of types and clich√©s. The bit parts are kept snappy, the small details (like the portable craps table) handy, far from the character players or the glamor of gambling in Casablanca. But then, Curtiz's big movie is iconic even in the details - it makes no effort to be subtle and genuine and penetrating, but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring. They come in opposite ends of the war and represent opposite opportunities for their leading men. Bogart begins his active duty, Dixon, and the man Dixon has killed is all over. Through, thoroughly but not washed up. <br /> <br /> It is not unfortunate that many, perhaps most movie neighbors, have what you would call "happy" endings. The man overcomes his opponents and transforms his inner self, and the film group, so and now, understands as beautiful it must feel.
