I've seen this movie a dozen times, and it's great. But the only thing about it was that in the beginning there was too much talk about who goes out with who. I think it would be interesting to remake it. But on the official site, they said they will not remake it because so many people have been saved when they see it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a really good actress. She has made several other films in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since. I know for sure if Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, is working for accounting at RD Films. But in general I have to say that the series itself is like left behind old school.
