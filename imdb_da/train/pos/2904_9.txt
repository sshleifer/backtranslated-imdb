This film is Damian Szifr√≥n's second immersion in film after his excellent character study in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well-executed characters, far from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I have seen Szifron's talent to present any character in a light hearted way, but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. His control over them is magnificent, so he restores the movie to a real right and a brilliant brilliantly polished script. The actors are laughing and crying with true feeling and inviting the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <Br /> <br /> Spanish takes over English, Buenos Aires urban area at night replaces Hollywood sets, and the premise is just as interesting as anything else, so we have a movie that wakes up to compete over Hollywood's Machines. <br /> But I want you to watch the movie, mainly because I've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. It seems that the script fits perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really believe in a movie that does this, Argentina is really up to the competition.
