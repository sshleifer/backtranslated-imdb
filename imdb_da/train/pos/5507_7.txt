I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Just reciting a few statistics won't do that with the younger audience. Still, part 1, which is almost completely shot in the jungle, captures the feel of this place, especially when passing through the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a good job against all odds. Clearly, Soderbergh does not look down on these people, but it is also clear that he will not invoke their case to 'yanquis' far from the recent times. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I have read. I did not know that Castro was entitled to the Soviet Union before any attempt to obtain acceptance from the United States was exhausted. But in other areas, he is right, especially with regard to aliens' plunder, when the island went into other rebel control. The state treasury was left empty.
