I must admit when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steaming"? In a 1968 film ?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot in black and white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this movie have all the elements of a steaming romance - the discovery of the first love, the fear of the secret is found out of a sudden unexpected end - but at times this film was even erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black and white. The cinematography deserves every recognition it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they are both in their mid-twenties and are trying to play schoolgirls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to address their sexuality then. Anyone looking for real teenagers here expects too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was far ahead of its time. The erotic level was an unexpected pleasure; but still managed to leave the imagination and chose instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown. I'm no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you guys who love to watch lesbians in action: Though it won't be all you expect, I don't think you will be too disappointed.
