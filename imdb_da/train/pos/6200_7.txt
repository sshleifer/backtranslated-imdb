Henry Fool is a better movie. But it's the perfect way to follow up with a movie like 'Henry Fool'. To take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the opening of 'Henry Fool' when Simon puts his ear to the ground when Henry comes across the hill is more revealed through 'Fay Grim'. The over-the-top jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about the film's writing and the jokes themselves), are good, but the film's opening is a bit saturated in them. Also, Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film crushes, yes it is the intention, but it feels forced and overused, it goes beyond what I want to call, annoying. It's a fake movie, but a must see for any Hartley or Henry Fool fan. <br /> <br /> Don't listen to stupid reviews, don't see this unless you've seen the first movie. The scheme, satire and weight of this movie is completely lost if you haven't seen Henry Fool. It is a successor. It's just stupid.
