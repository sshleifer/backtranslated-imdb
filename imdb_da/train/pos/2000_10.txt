I participated in a small mini-production of this when I was 8 at school, and my mother bought the video for me. I've loved it ever since !! When I was younger, it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences I enjoyed, but when I saw it when I got older, I appreciate the amazing play and character story. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can't imagine others playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy if the best character for me. She put so much on the boys I think she is so strong in character and her last scene when ... Well, you know ... Always make it cry! Best musical in my opinion all the time. It lasted all the time, it will continue for many years to come! 11/10 !!
