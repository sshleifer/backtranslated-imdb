Difficult movie commenting, how do you say it's bad? Well that's not it, but then it's just as hard to say, it's good. What it is is convincing view, it is as close as you will to complete destruction without being there. It is the photographs of the tsunami that are approaching the coast of Thailand, which has been made alive, you know you will turn away, but you must see. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers handle the comment very well, even in most tragic circumstances, something that happens in another country looks neither panders nor insults. Facts are on cellulose, and little is needed for the viewer to understand or understand what is going on. <br /> <br /> You can't change the story, and you shouldn't want, this movie stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour.
