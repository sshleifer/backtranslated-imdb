"They all laugh" is one of the little movies I always recommend to friends who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It is strongly rooted in the ancient scrub romance traditions, but seems more modern. Even the particular early 80's atmosphere does not date too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole company so easy on the feet that reality never brings it down to the ground. But that said, this kind of cute little movie is totally dependent on the actors to keep it going, and "TALK" is blessed with a dream cast that understands the demands of this kind of story. It is a movie that will not linger so long in memory if it was not for the small moments that the excellent cast gives: Colleen Camp also calls John Ritter and her dog orders; Blaine Novak releases all the hair under his hat; And especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says, "How ... strange." It's such a piece of fluff, you don't want to put too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it certainly gives one with a light heart and a smile on your face.
