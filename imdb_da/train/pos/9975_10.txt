It's not as good as the first movie, but it's a good solid movie, it has good car racing scenes. On the replay of this movie, there is a story that the hero is able to drive fast as he tries to hurry to the side of his grieving wife, the end is great just a good fair movie to look for my opinion <br /> <br />
