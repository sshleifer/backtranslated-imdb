The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies that I think are perfect. This little B picture is a tight story, well told. I have always been fascinated by Alexander Knox, but have seen him very few movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He confuses everything and everyone without a kid of remorse. The performance is one of the most chilling performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars. I imagine that since this was done during the war, the Academy felt it was like honoring the evil as honoring a performance like this. But Knox puts in that kind of performance - a man looked bitter and consumed by guilt that he didn't like to make others suffer. I still can't get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is thrown at type in probably the best performance I've ever seen her give. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I have enjoyed her in the "little" roles she often played. But here she turns to the task of heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama stories or stories of fate for those who suffered in the Nazi hands, I highly recommend this fine little movie.
