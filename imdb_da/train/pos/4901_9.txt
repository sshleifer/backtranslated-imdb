No message. No symbolism. No dark undercurrents. Just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and fun seen for peoples, which of course had a good time making it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious wastes being founded by studios. Of course, something with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth seeing. And Cleo Laines brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes further on my film shelf, which is pulled out again when I feel the need for a warm experience and a solid good natural chuckle. Just a wonderful movie!
