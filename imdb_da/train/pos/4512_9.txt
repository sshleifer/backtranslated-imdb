I saw this movie today and I have to say it was much better than I expected it to be about a couple of hours before I came to see it. Personally, I had some prejudices because of its language, but it completely changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances. It was a story of a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. This really affected me, and as a movie based on a true story, I convinced myself. A new school, psycho rector and a young boy who becomes acquainted with a new teacher, slightly different from the others and about fighting for things even though they do not seem to train. It showed how small things can make big changes in many things and how differences in some cases can cause difficult situations. I also think the actors' choices have succeeded perfectly. It really felt like you had been someone who saw the episodes as an outsider when they happened. Before I destroy this movie with praise, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't seem to be realistic. Just like the one where the school's principal hit Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that caused him was some blood that came from the nose when compared to the first stroke at the start when Frits got some masks .. even though I think every movie have their own faults .. had to say that if someday I find a place here in the DVD from the store, it is probably that I take it with me.
