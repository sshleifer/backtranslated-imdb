The question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I chose this on a used video store for 99 cents, just because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" on it (Vestron has been highly regarded as a quality label ever since I first acquired the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We didn't expect a movie so full of victory as this one was. Your basic plot as follows: Grange, this goombaesque thug from the planet Earth, robs the "Moon Bank" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I can't even remember the planet's name) to remind bauxite and other minerals. The colonist's "governor" and mine's owner exploit the prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they will have him deal with. Then there is the nameless "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter suffering from a joking revival nightmare. Much of the film centers around "futuristic" car gates (downbuckies with plywood turned to the sides) with explosions to a large extent. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other dusty Inland Empire outposts. But what makes the movie really shine is a surprisingly stunning soundtrack with several LA punk bands from the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed for vinyl, but it is definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. I can't even remember the names of the tapes (they are listed in the credits) except for exploding white mice, because that was the only one I had ever heard of before I saw this movie, but I definitely look at them. Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and will be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.
