I watched this movie as a Jane Austen addicted and always feel dubious about cinematic rendering of her novels complexity: Now this accomplishment is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, meticulous, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word perfect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most delightful and fun novels, thanks to the overarching iron-imminent situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony without disregarding the comic book (Miss Bates above all). What involved me in the novel and the film makes it clear is the profound knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist and the modern look that women, men and their relationships deal with, and it is amazing if we believe how The 18th-century female writer who lived almost a secluded life could understand this depth and truth of life as she did: the most and still fascinates me. We can feel this modernity throughout the film: Replace only costumes and use a more current language, but the situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in the lives of others or the insinuating envy, which now always regulates women's relationship and still the difficulty of revealing and expressing their feelings, especially love: every situation has a universal and out-of-time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited to this role (today she will probably be too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply amazing. And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then the fantastic English landscape, where every situation gets such a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really enjoyable and deserved film.
