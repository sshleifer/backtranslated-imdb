This movie is one of my favorites. It's a genre mix with ingredients from Action / Horror / Romantic / Comedy genre. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This minor error is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The views are also beautiful. The action is great, which is not surprising, it comes from Honkong, the birthplace of the world's best action movie. The mood sometimes seems a little stupid, but in a good way. Somehow, this movie is able to balance the different moods and keep it well. Definitely recommended.
