Since I haven't seen all the movies released in 2002, I can't say this is the best movie of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American black people films either observe the American concern about "race relations" or fall into the monasteries of the ghetto in inner city, with each sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased snake. Antwone Fisher stands proud alone in this respect: race is irrelevant, except for a fight that may or may not have been provoked by a race mission. <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher is one that should resonate with any empathic individual. He is underrated and thoughtfully portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while of course using his star power to make the film, is tied to the background mostly and allows the movie to be the Antwone Fisher story. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture will generally maintain the ghettoisation of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a movie that speaks to humanity in all of us . I just hope that the non-black audience will see this movie for that humanity rather than avoid it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie they can identify with. It would be a sad commentary on race in North America itself. <br /> <br />
