In fact, Goldie Hawn from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I go down. This is a kind of Mr. Smith goes to the Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. I taped this movie of cable years ago because I had a big crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that some cocktail waitress gets an important job in the government just because she saved some great shots life. It made me laugh and made me angry at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she felt were so ridiculous I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me sad to believe that our government would create an average citizen in the way she was created. And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful. Too bad, not many people have the courage as such in real life.
