It's a simple hook, but it works. It should be You cover a lot of the usual land, but take a new spin whenever possible. I liked all the NY signs and I loved the location. It's a NY postcard. It was also nice to watch a movie and not find anything offensive in it. So if you like a good old-fashioned romantic movie ... that's for you.
