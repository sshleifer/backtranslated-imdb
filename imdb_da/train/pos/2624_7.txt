In this movie we have the fantastic opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the movie when they are not shown - which is a lot! This movie even goes back to before Simba and (presumably) right after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> Probably the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a fun, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or sequel if that's what you want to call it ). While there is Timon and Pumbaa watching a movie at the cinema (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument about which point "The Lion King" they should begin to see as Timon will go to that part when he and Pumbaa comes in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very reasonable compromise on watching movies in their own story, which is what awaits ... It starts with Timon's first home ... For anyone with a good sense of humor who liked the first movie of almost everybody age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
