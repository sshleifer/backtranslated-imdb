Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to see. But the film far exceeds my very low expectations. It is so much more than just a representation of a century. It has very real portraits of the characters in it and most of the actors do a fantastic job. The various stories are baked together with actual recordings from the time that gives it a very unique print. As I looked at it, I really felt I was worried about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I also want to give endless praise to Julia Stiles in her portrayal of Katie, she was amazing in a way, stood out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
