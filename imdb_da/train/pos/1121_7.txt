Here is a really strange thing for you. It starts with a second start on the PSYCHO shower scene, on campus, and then becomes crazy when more coeds and their lazy boyfriends run south of Spring Break. The problem starts when they enter Redneck County run by homicidal Sheriff Dean. One of the college wounded walks into the woods, witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open. Then it lets MACON COUNTY LINE time be like dean stems, traps and slaughtered the unclear witnesses one by one. Tony March is on-target as the evil, shotgun-happy dean. The movie's overall tone is really disturbing. The end is so abrupt that you almost think the director ran out of film; It is also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists worldwide.
