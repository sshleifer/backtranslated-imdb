One of the beautifully intense movies that draw us so closely into it, ends it very soon! But was left to look at the screen like, "No they didn't!" Lol. Good performances all around! The action is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply excellent! I knew she would provide a solid and compelling performance that captures young Victoria's regency, temperament and vulnerability throughout the film. Production is also excellent in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse of a remarkable time in British history, through a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess, until her reign as a queen who later married Prince Albert, ended up with the birth of their first nine children. It had a well-written play and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert turned to win the young queen's attention than to secure his love before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was thrilling to see. Equally exciting was the relationship between teenage Victoria and her mother, who at times were rage, as with her mother and king William (who also did not like his mother). Plays and scenes were captivating, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone interested in the historical and political situation that exists in that era, and indeed anyone who loves a convincingly true Romanesque story
