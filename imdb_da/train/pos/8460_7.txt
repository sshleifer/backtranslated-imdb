Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for getting me to Gundam and anime in general. But after seeing its predecessors, like Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. Signs: One aspect that Gundam holds for a long time is to have their characters cause difficulties and grow into maturity. This does not happen in Wing. Heero is the top dog in the beginning and he is the top dog at the end. The personalities do not change, the growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, which is essentially a hero in most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and makes him a villain without apparent cause. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has great suits design. Gundams is super cool, with Epyon as my favorite. I am even considering some of the OZ suit designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits. But the sweet-wear designer doesn't quite save the series from boring characters. Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cold fighting scenes, although it is subject to recycled animation, but low plan and character development. Easily but not in motion as previous Gundam excursions.
