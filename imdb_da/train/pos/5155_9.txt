"Hitler: The Evil Rise" was encased in the controversy before it was ever sent, and this controversy can prevent the performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the movie, which they hadn't seen, did so with good intent, based on the erroneous thinking that it would be too sympathetic to Hitler. But they misunderstood the point: humanizing evil Hitler is not sympathetic to him. It is far more disturbing to realize that the indescribable acts of one of history's greatest villains were committed by a human being. A sick, sick man, to be safe, but a man anyway. It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again. <br /> <br /> The "Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliant career's best performance by Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler a human being without ever releasing him in any way. Carlyle captures the filmman's appearance and manicures without letting the imitation become cartoonish or distant (something Anthony Hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed Hitler in "The Bunker", another very good television movie). Whilst Hitler's degradation and virulent anti-Semitism have been rejected, Carlyle gives him some magnetism and power that the real Adolf Hitler must have possessed. After all, would another nation have followed him? <br /> <br /> Of the various subplots, by far the most compelling features are Matthew Modine as reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. While Modine's performance is a bit stilted in part 1, he seems to have settled in part 2, the character giving us a real hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide strong support. Part 1 of this two-part mini-series suffered a bit from being too choppy, including a look at Hitler's childhood, which only lasts the duration of opening credits. And in Part 2, the sections on Hitler's relationship with his niece and his mistress Eva Braun are less successful than the central plot, but serve to give us a better insight into his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, no movie about Hitler can make us understand him. The average person is fortunately unable to never understand a man who would try to eradicate an entire people. "Hitler: The Evil Rebellion" is trying less to get us to understand Hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power. It is an important story to tell, and it is impossible to believe that anyone who has seen the movie would accuse it of having anything but the best intentions and ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
