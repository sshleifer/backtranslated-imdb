Well, the main reason I voted to watch this movie is because it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in South Park fame. But as soon as the movie started, the laughter began to jump out of my stomach. From the subtle gestures towards a joke, to the blatant toilet humor all the way along with a constant dependence on some very witty insinuation. This movie can ruin the event as it stretches most poker side, let alone his poker underwear. Some of the funniest flashes and you will miss the jokes that have ever been portrayed in Hollywood, along with constant criticism of themselves thrown into the bargain. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to show that Trey Parker is not only good at writing he's not too shabby at the old-fashioned game. I was surprised at the amount I was absorbed in this movie. But I am very worried that it is not available to buy via the Internet, here in the UK. Sort it out from boys! I am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny pieces, and sometimes lashing into my store. All in all, an excellent movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. But if you have no sense of humor about stupid or rude things manage well! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have gurgled you past these prejudices.
