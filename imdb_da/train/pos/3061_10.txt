This film shows the kind of ensemble work you want in each movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positively chilling and discussing the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also great. They play each other as members of a top-notch theatrical troupe who realizes that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly. And finally there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What a great achievement from a child ... and what a horrible resemblance he has to Ullman whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We are treated to a unique story in "Panic" and it is rare these days with tired formula sets. The dialogue is sharp and smart, and this relatively short film still has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked to be horrified, to be mourned, to awaken, to be angry and to love. It's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know you've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a bad job. Several of us would go to theaters if we were treated to quality ticket like this. When are the powers that are in Hollywood to wake up? It's a real shame when something, the good, doesn't get exposure beyond festivals and households that are fortunate enough to have cable.
