This can only be the most nostalgic journey back in time and through time, when a childhood begins a journey of recall and back and forth, back and forth, up and down and around. The boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo also through and through. The last day's inspirations of Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview Special" Sigmund & Sea Monsters, and Land of the Lost both the new and the old are what this very show roared gorge to as well as The Donny & Marie Show, Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour and even Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Perhaps even other things in between & Beyond the Buck just continue to go on & beyond and beyond expectations and as well as unexpected boundaries. Now that we are updated in March of '06, we know that Jack Wild is gone & so now makes it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic. Included now in August of '06 both when Jack Wild guest stars like themselves at Sigmund and The Sea Monsters as well as when in a last episode HRPuffinstuff also does and to remember all the other nostalgic journeys of all the South & Marty Kroft characters, including also HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club; The Donny and Marie Show; Brady Bunch Variety Hour Brady Bunch Hour; Truly, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer et al. "Ste" by Framingham, Ma.USA.
