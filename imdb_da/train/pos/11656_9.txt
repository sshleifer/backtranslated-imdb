I've seen a couple of movies about eating disorders, but this one was absolutely my favorite. The problem with the others was that the people with eating disorders at the end automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and that is it. This movie I thought was more realistic cause in this one protagonist Lexi doesn't automatically just get better. She gets better and has a disadvantage. I think this movie shows more than the others that I have seen, getting better, not just happening, it's hard work and takes time, it's a long way to recovery. I think this movie shows everything good. There must be more movies like this.
