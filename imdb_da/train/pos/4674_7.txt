What percentage of movies does a person see in those days that let them wonder what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: Too many! This movie is not like that. It is a story of real people who are sometimes a combination of both cozy and unlikely. <br /> <br /> The downside: <br /> <br /> Not enough character development and some plot lines left twist in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upward: <br /> <br /> Forcing viewers should think about the choices they made for good or bad in their own lives. Well done by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Includes some good bright humor.
