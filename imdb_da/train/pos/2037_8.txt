Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and it is evident in his debut horror flick 'Creep'. 'Creep', although it is a bit lost on information, shows itself to be a true gory classic. Slightly shimmering than the recent American horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake) follows this dark and horrible tale of Kate (Franka Potente) through the maze of underground tunnels and disused railways like she and a number of others along the way, try to escape a murderous attacker. Although some bad reviews have slated this movie, I really believe in a tight budget and for a British production from first-time CEO Smith that "Creep" really lives up to its name. It gives faster gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast, as the story is rude in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character reaction-at-end I've seen in a while 'Creep' delivers some scenes that are certainly marbleous things.
