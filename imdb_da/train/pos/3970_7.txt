This is a film that on the surface seems to be all about J.Edgar Hoover, who pauses to fight the Klansmen, go after Indian killers, hunt for the famous 1930s mobsters, fight Nazis in the US and South America during World War II and Commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course in 1959 we didn't know about Mr. Hoover's obsession to keep secret files on honest Americans who beat people like Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., but worst of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (To learn more about this topic, I suggest watching the movie Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, This story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent but dated movie. Vera Miles as her devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover-controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen without error, the Jimmy Stewart movie gave a human side, quite a feat, as Hoover always looks over his shoulder. Background score is also comfortable. I've read the latest online articles that suggest this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars all the time, and none of his films were to be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they show it again.
