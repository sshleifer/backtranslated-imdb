I have to say I thought I had seen it all. I'm an extremely combed movie buff. This movie didn't shock me in any way. I'm far beyond that point. But it took me to some emotional places I didn't know I could go to. I had no idea that I could ever find (ick) the idea of ​​beastiality erotic. Never never never. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did it. I need to give the director credit. He took it off. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes, this movie is a TOTAL bore. We start with some very explicit pictures of two horses that have sex. After five minutes, I began to wonder if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair speaks to another old guy about two people getting married. Then a nervous guy shaves. Then we (briefly) see a warm chick that gets it on with a butler (but it's very short). At this point, I cursed the film loudly and tried to keep myself awake. In fact, I fell asleep about a 40 minute mark and forced me to finish the next night. We finally get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is or who is in this movie) has a dream that a Victorian era is being ravaged by an animal in the forest. The scene continues for some time, and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. It is beautifully shot, wonderfully edited and delivers the goods. They try to unpack the plot at the end, and that makes sense, but it doesn't. Oh good. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely redissolved it.
