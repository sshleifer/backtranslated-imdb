I do not expect this movie to be well understood by the viewers out of Romania. This tells something definite about the value, or perhaps about the lack of universality in the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life for ordinary people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule shortly after the book was published. It tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after being imprisoned by false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically, the first part of the movie tells the story of his struggle for survival in the prison, the other describes his preliminary to regain his life after being released. In fact, his release is only evident, Romania in the 60s asks him for various kinds of compromises and crimes, but yet his struggle for survival is just as hard morally as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully recorded by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who starred, would be in another time and another place a megastar, we can get a good glimpse of his amazing plays. While suffering from a hesitant story that sometimes tells and falls into non-essential details or comics, the film is still an important milestone for the Romanian cinema as well as for the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
