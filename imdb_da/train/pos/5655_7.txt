I saw this show on the basis that it was told that it is reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I love. The show begins to introduce us quickly to the protagonists, and quite unusual, the pilot episode is me the best of the party, it is extremely dramatic and really comes out of the whole evil side of the show, ready for the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little disappointed at the show - probably not through its own fault, when it was canceled after just one season, it seemed to show much potential and it deserved much better treatment than it did. The action is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) in what I've ever seen that are well-developed in a short time. There is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or 10 shows, which is a little overly dramatic, but this is corrected as the season progresses. Well worth a watch, definitely something out of the ordinary!
