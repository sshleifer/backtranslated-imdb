This film was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. Very, very fun. It starts with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and it "builds" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40s .... clothing, architecture and family life. There are many references to the cost of things, and these comparisons with today's costs are pretty amazing. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie altogether. I'm surprised at the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A real classic.
