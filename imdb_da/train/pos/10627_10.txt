So what constitutes a true independent film? At a time and age where the latest fad of mainstream Hollywood seems to be robust and groundbreaking, I regret to say that what the public tends to perceive as independent film is usually no more than a smart marketing game. <Br /> <br /> Therefore, we should be happy to find movies like "Hat of a Minute". Across the board, this movie makes a point of contradicting its own template (indie horror movie). Love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid to be what it is and in watching this movie you get the real feeling that Kallio (the director) not only made this movie to spray fake blood all over the place, He is here to tell stories. Excellent. You can find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but don't be fooled. This story is also about love, if good people are pushed over the edge and the light so far removed at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect dirt or an Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the finer points in the horror / thrill genres, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie and I'm sure he's proud to tell someone it's not "Evil Dead". Bruce has never tried to knock on his "ash" image, and it is obvious that he was not involved in "Hatred" so it couldn't be done either. <br /> <br /> My advice to all Dead-ites who devour everything that is issued by Mr. Campbell, is to control this movie anyway and see what others Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell is trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The action is well done, though nothing about this movie is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. So often, actors in movies like these don't even seem to have "Hatred", it seemed that all the actors took their charecters very seriously and never used typical horror movie campiness. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hat" is as competent as indie film gets. The editing is fast, the cinematography is good considering the budget, and "hat" keeps a fast pace without any book-down points or bad anti-climaxes. All in all, Hatred can't have the glossy overview of all the multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally I don't see a problem with it. It's a movie of people who actually care about the medium. People who got into their broken pockets, pulled their nails and dimmed, threw caution against the wind and made an amazingly good movie. <br /> <br /> Check this out.
