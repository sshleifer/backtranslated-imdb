I watched the movie a few days back on a videotape, and although it was difficult to swallow it at once (because of its length and history), I liked it. I was first impressed by the script and then by the realization of this script. The film takes you on a trip, but it is not an easy, joyful trip; It goes through time and various political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic that the film followed; logic, like the logic of life, was rather illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and the twists were sensible. However, it makes no sense to try to tell the story as it spreads over more than 50 years. I also liked Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei and the way he played on what some critics would see, with restless task. What I didn't like about it was that I thought he later played characters reminding me of Aleksei in movies like "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romance, which I actually love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Injured "(" Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye "). "Sibiriada" shows what a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making forgettable movies like "Tango and Cash" and less forgettable as "Runaway Train". I prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
