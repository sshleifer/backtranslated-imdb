You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really good, it's a 10 out of 10, so I can't believe that other users of this web had rated it so poorly unless they expected to see just a normal movie with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentary is a great way to wake up to saving our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "An Inappropriate Truth", which is mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with "truths", not always accurate as many researchers have already pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to miss the Earth.
