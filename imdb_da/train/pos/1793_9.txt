I watched this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything about it, from the sweet moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) is crying because of her bad decision to marry a man to her parents and not because she really is in love. I loved these moments because they were just as real. At first, I was seriously worried that I was hoping that it would not end up as Bobby, who was a great cast, but a poorly written film without real meat for it. But in the middle of the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but in the end you will want to see the evening again. Trust me when I say, SEE IT!
