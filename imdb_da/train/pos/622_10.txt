Although I don't consider myself a big fan of adventure movies, Stardust excited me to see Michelle Pfeiffer in trailers as a villain (especially when I was watching her as the twisted Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her ancient makeup at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Almost all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also fantastic faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (like Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is good as the driver Tristan, and he as much as his father Dunstan as a young man whom I thought he was in early stages with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride, and while I can see some similarities, the biggest difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary story as explained by an old man to his grandchild. Stardust makes you believe, mostly that what you see and hear could actually have happened even with all the hilarity that happens all the way through. So on that note I strongly recommended Stardust.
