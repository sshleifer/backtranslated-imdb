This is by far my favorite movie all the time. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not afraid to dive into some very politically wrong subjects (such as spanking and female submission) that other ordinary movies are just too modest. Nothing seems to be beyond the limits of this film, as the director freely develops the story with no concern for possibly insulting the viewer. However, I do not think that anything here had happened solely for shock value or intentionally insulting anyone. Sean Young gets an excellent and brave performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken up this role or would have requested some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members also do a fine job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on a payline since a compulsory card runs a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (which comes closer and closer to hardcore porn), but will not carry a mainstream movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it might not be made today. <br /> <br />
