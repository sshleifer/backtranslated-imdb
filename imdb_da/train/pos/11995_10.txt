"Spin it!" The 90s opened with a smart Disney favorite, "TaleSpin", the television cartoon series that featured characters from "The Jungle Book." Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly Sea Duck as you have never seen before: out of Cape Suzette, to Louie's, up mountains, through jungles, on water, in volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasure and leader after fun, all in an action packed cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was a favorite for me as well as my family. This ran on Disney afternoon throughout the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old Disney Channel in 1995, which I have seen on vacation once in 1996, before getting cable in March 1997. <br /> < br /> And good news: Today the DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Thin, Down, Down, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
