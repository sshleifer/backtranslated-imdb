I first looked at this movie when I was a child and is the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in complete horror on a particular scene. I remembered it again with a dissection with my uni friends and quickly bought it on video with lots of hesitation I could add (to my surprise I only found it on the internet in the states when it was made in England!) When I saw it was again my reaction and to my surprise almost the same, of pure fear and fear and never has my heart beat so much too. This, in my opinion, is that SCARIEST movies are ever made, Hollywood movies look pretty similar and a little Pony and Trap (crap), excuse the pun. What is great is the power of this movie and on the uni when you see this with about 20 of my contributors, I have never heard so many screams, even blocks! Even the sight of the video brings the fear of God into me of one scene and left me feeling that I will never go alone again in the dark !!!!
