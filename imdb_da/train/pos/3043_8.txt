This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one-man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian movie guests are talented buyers. <br /> <br /> On top of his dominance over Bollywood, Amitabh, when his one-time goddess Prakash Mehra decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and building stories out of it, and adds liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clich√©s to it. Zanzeer saw the production of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard, and Namak Halal was about the loyalty of the master's servant. <br /> <br /> But then the theme was limited to moving the manuscript through the regulation three hours of singing, dancing and drama. What makes up the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi that goes to Mumbai and becomes a regulating hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie serve its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent. For me, this alone is the biggest feature of the movie. The rest are all typical Bollywood screenwriting. <br /> <br /> Now, Amitabh had some typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The schoolmaster of the party, the monologue of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, the mosquito challenge on the board and the usual drunkards scene that has now become a standard Amitabh fare. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody character (remember him asking Ranjeet for "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake event "). His was the lead's main role while Amitabh was his loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Native American mind ... and so Shashi had to keep up with his action with the rest of the movie, it was a sign that could have been more developed to make a serious movie, but it's a creator, remember ? And as long as it got in that way, the people and then Amitabh came wearing a new hat and went home satisfied. The end is always predictable, and the good people get mad and the bad goes to the tub, the old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and everything is good that ends well. <br /> <br /> So w hat is what makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi.Prakash Mehra created another icon in the name of a story. the story, the characters and the plot My characters are for Amitabh al one.
