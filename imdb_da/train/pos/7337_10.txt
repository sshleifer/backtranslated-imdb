Good story and great animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that is a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The struggle between good and evil is clearly cut, although it may turn out that our heroes are sometimes neutral. Mostly in fantasy films Elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blonde hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with Frazetta's, Bakshi's or even Tolkien's work knows that they are not racist. Anyone who enjoys Fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for young children because of violence and sexual induendo. Castings were well done, and scenes and music are top notch. I hope somebody puts this gem on DVD soon. I consider myself fortunate to have a VHS copy in good condition.
