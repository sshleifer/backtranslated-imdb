I also saw this at the release in '56, and has been beaten since then with its final scene. If this is an answer to 'High Noon' then it is an appropriate and appropriate answer. The notion that "the city is coming together", as this string is heading, is a much stronger message than the lonely personal full-time "High Noon". In this theme, 'Concho' is a phenomenal precursor to my other all-time favorites, 'The Magnificent Seven.' Both Sinatra and Conrad provide impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from childbirth bullying to liberating city-saving. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family who over the years have inflicted my love on this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
