I think comments on the show are cheesy, a little overly exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a TV show, what does he look like? It is to enjoy seeing a show unless he / she is a critic or a person analyzing the story. But most of us are not so and see the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to look for a hard day at the office / school. It makes you laugh, and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfect hypothetical family. If such a family existed, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a television show and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with portraying a hypothetical family on television. The fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed it, no matter what the comments are. <br /> <br /> Another good point about the show is that any person of any age will not only enjoy watching it but would take a message back but childishly that message is. De Jessi's lecture with Michelle is extremely touching if you do not think of it as childish. All in all, after seeing every show in Full House, there is a satisfaction in your heart that rarely presents after many other shows.
