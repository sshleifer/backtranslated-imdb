Stupid, funny, tragic, sad and inevitable. A group of down-and-outs goes along with a "spicy" villain to get out of their poverty. Good idea ... if you ignore the screw factor. <br /> <br /> Nice to see George Clooney do something really fun for a change. Castings are perfect and the working standards are very high. Although it can be said that the motive of the motif is not new, I think this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. Suffice it to stand out from what has gone before. <br /> <br /> Very well done guys.
