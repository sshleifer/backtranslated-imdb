We stumbled across the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and were "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the room was transfixed on the television and the scary pictures of Edith and Edie, who seemed to live their lives in virtually a room in a large dirty mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on cob (which was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat urinates on edith's bed and her incredible words, "I like it [the smell]." We hadn't seen the beginning and wondered what we saw and how these aristocratic women managed to get into the position they were in. Spell binding! one must see !!!!
