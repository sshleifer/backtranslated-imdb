Shakespeare said we are actors in a big stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work we interpret is to multiply for ten and all the actions we do, full of a tough style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of part of life in Tel Aviv, but also to manage Katzir to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and this people is far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark informative core in which they live, and this wonderful country emerges as the light as a fantastic bird born of his ashes. It is very good to me because Israel's reality, which Europeans only know about the informative newspapers or newspapers, appears to be a close and absolute human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only purpose to feel part of it. Katzir constructs a wonderful documentary and demonstrates that when a man's film of passion is projected the deepest feelings of power, and these emotions cross our hearts. Thanks Dan for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
