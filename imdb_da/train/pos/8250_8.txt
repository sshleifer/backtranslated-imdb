This film takes place in the 1950s. According to these, the dead (called zombies) arise to eat the living. But a company has developed a collar that, when they sit around the zombie neck, makes them skilled and perfect servants. Robinson's mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him, and Timmy loses control of Fido and it goes wrong. As you can see, this is - among many other things - a start on the "Lassie" series with Fido as a stand for Lassie. Timmy was named for a reason! Every one of the famous Lassie episodes is spun here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off for help before the zombies eat him! It is also a satire of the 1950s Douglas Sirk films, where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secrets break people apart. The characters carry very bright 1950s clothing (moss is always in a dress) - furniture, settings and cars are especially all 1950s in hyper bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to look at. The script is good - but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make. The melodrama is a little stupid, but the cast pulls it off. Everyone here is excellent and right on target. Even Connolly as an emotional zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - plays every line for all its worth --- but never goes overboard. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). The satire can be lost on most people and gore is pretty tame. Gore is done so randomly and with happy music playing it is hard to take it seriously. So for some people it will really work. I give it a 8.
