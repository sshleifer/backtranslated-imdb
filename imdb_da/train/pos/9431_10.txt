And this is a very disturbing movie. I may be wrong, but this is the last movie I saw Burt Reynolds as a current actor who transformed the role and delivered a message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are modest and ignorant; Businessmen wanting to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next time. <br /> <br /> The photography and sets are realistic and natural. This was before Wes Craven days. <br /> <br /> What is most worrying about this movie is that there are still places like this. In America, its folk music confuses the people of the people; It's almost one and a half and a half since the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural areas of South Georgia, which still exists. Just don't drive past it to Mobile, Alabama; That area has still not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
