For a year of pretentious muck like "Synecdoche, New York", a movie born out of Charlie Kaufman's own self-confidence, a movie that is just as difficult to see comes but about three times as important. "Frownland" is an occupation of the crew, the actors and the filmmaker who shot over years of friends. It tracks a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic, real Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own independent neuroses, unwilling to change, unable to. The real world to them is their own set of delusions, and because it's a film about people who are so out of touch, it's very hard to see. It's 16mm film making without proper light, money or any of the other factors that would make a movie "slick" but its honesty can't be underestimated, a fact that would get a room full of people to reject it and for Richard Linklater to give it a prize he did at SXSW. This is reminiscent of movies like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a movie that's not for everyone, but one that challenges you to see and grow on you the longer you think about it.
