The first time I saw it, I got half of it, but I saw, and I knew it later, it was about a salem witch attempt. They focused on Sara Good's family. She is famous for cursing a priest who became true. In the film, she depicts the daughter's and her husband's spirit in Ann Putnam. Sara's husband emerges in the future, hunts this girl to redeem her soul. which happens at the end of the movie. Dorcas is depicted as witch by 5 years burned to the stake. As never happens Ann Putnam saves her from the flames. The girl is sure she goes to Ann Putnam's tomb to see that it is not empty, but it is only because she accuses her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death. Now that ann putnam saves her, her spirit is redeemed and she is not extradited to the community for the salem witch process.
