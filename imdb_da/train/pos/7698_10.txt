But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang ranks nothing like a combat choreographer, only Sammo Hung compares at best. This is immediately clear from its proud exhibition of technology - on the other hand, than flashy camera angles etc. - during the games. The direction is tightly controlled not only to awaken the viewer by speed and movement, but to fear her with the exact skill shown. This movie also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance on the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the highest points in Kung Fu movie history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (by My Young Tantie Fame) and 'Hsiao Hou' whose acrobatics are breathtaking and preferred for any amount of wirework. As far as the plot is concerned, this film does not follow uncommon revenge, but with character and moral development along the way and a most appropriate solution. The mood in this is also the best. If you only see a kung fu movie ever, it would be a good choice - it has it all.
