This comedy with very underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors trying to achieve this elusive blend that has not come anywhere near the depth and clarity of it. This is certainly because the unusual caste of excellent performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly grabbed your interest and emotions and kept them throughout the film. Initially, the action seems rather out of the wall and shaken, but one learns gradually that these two rather pathetically damaged people are desperately and inappropriately trying to heal themselves, even though they are careful through each other. Rogers' heartbreaking facial expressions of numbness and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that you feel as you observe them. You will worry about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it is in doubt, and everything depends on a foggy emotional thread. Hopefully the audience will see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this movie shows their profits as very successful actors without a doubt.
