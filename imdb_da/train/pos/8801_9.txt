This is the biggest movie I saw in 2002 while I am used to mainstream movies. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the elected directors), I feared that it would have an anti-American basis, but ... it's kind of (11 times) personal tribute. The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he can't "swallow his pride" and sees this event as a reputable punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the movie, but it shows a true freedom of speech for the whole piece. The strangest thing comes from the Mexican almost conceptual art ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile or cry or even leave me stunned. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11 disaster, but it's so beautiful that its final place deeply "does it".
