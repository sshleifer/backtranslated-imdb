Back to the roots of "as it is in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes produce a message that appeals to each heart. We've seen it twice now in a cinema packed for the last place: love pure and joy within a cross music that is simple but filled with power when everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the glitter of fame to the junior high school, now empty and ready to be adapted as its new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and drawing into the life of simple, hot and hard people in the north. <br /> <br /> He wins the hearts of music and wins the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Don't see it if you've been normalized to Hollywood. These things contain no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
