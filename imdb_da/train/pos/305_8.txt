Screwball comedy about romantic disagreements in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is, of course, in love with all the women in his image - he honors them - yet Audrey Hepburn (of course) is placed over the others, after all, she is the princess Bogdanovich probably in love with the cinema 30 years earlier. He shoots her in loving close-ups, goes straight into the sheets between her and a wonderful hard-boiled / soft-boiled Ben Gazzara, and gives her room to work all the time. The love connections made during the film are fast and fun, even though I'm tired of John Ritter's television style clutchiness. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and the grounded, earthy sensual Patti Hansen are all thrilling to see. But it's really Hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****
