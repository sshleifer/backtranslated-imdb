The story of Baghdad's thief (as it once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, as star Douglas Fairbanks in the first silent reproduction of "Thief of Bagdad" for less impressive, recent trials. The best, however, remains the 1940's version, which for its time was a spectacular, magical panoply of top-quality special effects. These effects still affect their charm. No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor film, which star Sabu as the boy's thief, Abu, John Justin as the beloved deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess searched by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a spooky Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is distinguished by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad is treacherously deposited by Jaffar, and when he was later arrested by the treacherous snake, he and the boy, Abu, are suffering what is clearly incapacitated fate. Ahmad becomes blind and Abu becomes a lovable nut. Their adventure through the cosily decorated Hollywood backlots is fun, but the special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from a magical flying blanket to the giant genius jumping out of a bottle of a Tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard also made the special effects of the 1961 version of this movie. Both men had long and prominent career in technical magic.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is incredibly delighted, while slightly calling for serious action. Justins Ahmad designs a driven but dreamy romance untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the key player in many scenes and he is very good. For a movie intended for children as well as adults, there is a lot of violence, but of the bloodless nature. Still, I don't think anyone under eight should see Baghdad's thief. <br /> <br /> This film makes periodic performances on television, but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with very few young people present. It was great to see computer-occupied children in a wealthy society reacting with bowl and applause to special effects that should seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Thief of Baghdad" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values ​​often resulted in persistently attractive and important releases. This is one of the best in its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
