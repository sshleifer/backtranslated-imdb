One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. The members of the Summer of Love culture, in the late 70s and early 80s, eventually became tools of love balls and whole night parties and evolved back to ordinary life, whatever it meant. For those who could not grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exclamations, their culture was in Wonderland. A love of drugs and a sense of justice combined with a confusion for authority, values ​​and "establishment" is the world that the film captures. The 60s were a revolutionary time and violent changes that tore the American "house" apart. When the fighting was over, we all had to deal with the follow-up of the carnage. The characters in the Wonderland House are icons of seventies misfits; part biker, part hippie, part villain, all excluded. No ideology to express, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and believe in nothing. Ron, Billy and David fancy themselves as a kind of Robin Hoods with dope. They talk about love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the committed; They steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and company are the result of a strange collision of anti-material such as sex and drugs and rock & roll when the lab technicians get bored and continue. <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the fabric fiends in their element. That Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transitional and forgetful era.
