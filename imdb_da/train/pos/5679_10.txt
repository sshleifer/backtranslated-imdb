After the second-rate success, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) lives in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Through this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom, Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries to pick a gentleman for a rat city, trying to sell a book, trying to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, trying to be a highway man and finally posing as the prince. This is a very good submission to the popular comedy. Includes performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won the BAFTA for the Best Comedy Series and it was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 largest British actors, he was number 24 on Comedian's comedian, and number 8 on Britain's favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on the 100 largest television characters, and he was number 3 on the world's largest cartoon characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on Britain's best sitcom. Excellent!
