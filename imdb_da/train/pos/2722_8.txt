This recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in Kansas, based on the Capote book, is heavily absorbed by Brooks and cinematographer Hall in black and white, giving it a documentary feel. There are good performances from Blake and Wilson as the killers and Forsythe as a policeman pursuing them. The scenes leading to the murders recorded at the actual house where the crime arose, with a soundtrack of whistled winds, are quite intense and chilling. Brooks leads with a lot of enlistments and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit lengthy, with denouement pulled out and some preaching.
