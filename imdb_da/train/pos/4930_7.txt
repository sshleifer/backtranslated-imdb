"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little disappointed with it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never explores or develops. It's well made and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The manuscript for this is really weak and brings the whole movie down. None of the key characters are truly convincing or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well crafted to compensate for the weaknesses. Elia Kazan's direction keeps the film exciting and moving at a fast pace. There are some standout sequences, especially the memorable chase climax. When his direction was combined with better screens several years later, the man could not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> The play is also very good. Richard Widmark was always a vacant manager and does what he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas spends his time shouting too much, but also does a decent job. Standouts in the throw are the two bad guys. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of the cinema's ultimate toady characters. Jack Palance is not surprisingly a chilling villain. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing but still worth seeing. (7/10)
