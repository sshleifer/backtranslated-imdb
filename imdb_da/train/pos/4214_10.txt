The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie), Pickup on South Street count as one of the best movies noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when he's out of control, of course, but almost everything in the pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket that steals a microfilm that would go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who bore the film to her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeons played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peter's loyalty (that and the fact that she learns that she works for communists, the cold war thing is really interesting). The love story is made a little quick and not entirely credible, but it is not so bad that it damages the movie (unlike Fuller's previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is amazing. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter offers the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her last scene in this movie is as touching as anything you find in the cinema. I will never forget it. 10/10.
