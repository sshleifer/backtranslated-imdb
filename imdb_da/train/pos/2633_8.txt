I have to be honest, I expected a bug so bad because it really sounds like they were trying to crack the original movie for money. But that was not the case with this rather funny (sometimes odd) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story of Simba, and he had trouble sleeping was fun. The jacuzzi bubble, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it's pretty good for a straight to Video and DVD movie. While the film seems a bit strange and kind of paths towards the end, it works. 8 out of 10
