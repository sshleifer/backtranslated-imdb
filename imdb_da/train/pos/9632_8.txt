The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweep seems surprisingly fun. It guarantees some fun situations and stupid antics, especially from Stan Laurel of course as usual. The film also has a subplot with a nutty professor working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent, but both plot lines fit perfectly with the memorable end. It's still a little strange, but it's fun anyway, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting film is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler, and Lucien Littlefield goes great over-the-top as a nutty professor. The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, all of which are completely predictable, but become hilarious to look anyway thanks to the way they are all executed. It all helps make "Dirty Work" one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
