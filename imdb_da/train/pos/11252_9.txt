This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy. I saw it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still like it. It is natural that it be compared to beeb's other great Le Carre series, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on "games" spies play; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that these movies share with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - creating a multidimensional space of true vs. false, inside and outside, love vs. responsibility. In a way, these characters are happiest when they are treated most shabbily by those they love and respect - "backstabbed" in their different nuances. <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father figures is also important. One of the most exciting characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the protagonist Magnus' maybe ersatz father. Throughout history he betrays and is betrayed. A villain who always climbs up the ladder when he has been overthrown, which seems impenetrable to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you love your old man?" and never, "do you love me?" Maybe this is somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is malignancy. The character of the company is turning others - turning them against their government, against their friends and colleagues, turning them to their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre movies I've seen, the Spy coming in from the cold is looking into the glass war, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People and A Perfect Spy, turning and turning, the foundation of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films, there is usually only one gun shot or maybe two shots that post the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just below the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells, but in the objects that Le Carre's characters adhere to, as they unfortunately sucked into the morass. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movies above and you enjoy a perfect spy, you're in for a treat. I would also recommend The Sandbagger Series (Yorkshire TV), the second and third season begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity. The IPCRESS file and the funeral in Berlin are good but lightweight. For political intrigue, try a very British coup, card room and yes, minister / yes, prime minister. <br /> <br /> If only one British would put their hand to make the three kingdoms - there would be a movie of intrigue and complexity.
