This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and best movie from 1994. David Dhawan does a great job of directing this movie, he makes fun and adds family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives a good performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this movie she is a little less annoying, but still irritates in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a fantastic performance. Aroona Irani is great as a mother and gives an excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu sidekick. This movie features comedy, action, family drama and romance a full on entertainer.
