What I was expecting: A rather paralyzed excessive stereotypical depiction of a sporting guy and a like-minded stereotype of the madman who likes him but suffers while being the second banana to his overly keen demand for his favorite sporting crew. <br /> <br /> What I got: A fair story where both the guy and the gal end up admitting - for themselves and each other - that they each have passions in their lives, but each can forgive the other for save the love they share. <br /> <br /> Sounds sappy, but with that unstoppable humor and amazing performances, this story works! Barrymore is classic Barrymore: the perfect blend of sweet, strong and sweet. We expect it from her and she delivered. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the wonderful surprise in this movie. He brings the role of the perfect blend of sports need combined with the appreciation of the normal things in life, such as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers its subtle perfection lines. He can be caring ("You just ran across the field for me!") And in the same spirit, his love for the red sox is carefully dazzled ("How did the grass? Kinda spongy?") At the same time. Fallon's depiction "made" the movie. Hopefully, this movie marks the start of a better movie career for Fallon, beyond the overall sophomoric humor typical of the SNL alumni (ie, Will Ferrell). In short, a movie that could have been the victim of stereotypical male and female characters rose above this limitation and gave non-stop spot-on humorous lines, mostly supplied with brilliant subtlety of Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hi, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it as much as I did. It is neither a "Guy Flick" or "Chick Flick". It's a wonderful make-you-laugh flick. Go see it!
