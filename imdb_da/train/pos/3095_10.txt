So what's the reason? Is there any kind of vendetta against this AWESOME show or anyone involved in it? Why should the best show I've seen this year be canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this show randomly in the fall and loved it instantly and saw it every week. Then it went away and I tried to tivo it, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot for a while until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the unwanted on television today it was refreshing to see something as rounded and developed as this. I see Boston Legal for my eccentric comedic fix and House for my intellectual mystery jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for her "realism" and I love / hate the show, but it couldn't be any longer from the real to me. Way too much drama. Everything that can go wrong does. But for once there is a drama that is truly genuine. Real people, real problems. Certainly, there are some extremes that a former gangster became good, the girl runs from the mob, etc. But these people (especially in NYC) are really out there and I relate to each one of them. I can't seem to get enough. I just hope ABC will get their heads out of their prayer talker and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the best shows at all times. If anyone just wants to let it go.
