Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only known in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to international audiences: Canadian history and First Nations Culture. "Gray Owl" is an easy study of how a man was to be adopted in Ojibway in Northern Ontario, learning and preaching the environment decades before it became politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured by his past. The torture, however, is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact it may have. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a movie that keeps the audience without violence. It pays great respect for Canada's first nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical way. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I suppose it's just how Lord Attenborough wanted him. <br /> <br /> Thanks from a proud Canadian.
