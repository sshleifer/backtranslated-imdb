I was going to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's passers-by with many unfinished films of his I own on VHS; But in view of my running merry Christmas marathon, I had to deal with just this! As it happens, it has one of its best performances - and he was rightly nominated for it (with the film itself honored). This was also one of 14 partners with the second most recognized star to come from Italy, Sophia Loren; both play against type here - she is a young llamorous housewife and he is gay! <br /> <br /> That way, the title of the movie has a double meaning: the leading characters are gathered on the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in a long archive movie), but it refers more specifically to the "short meeting" of the stars, sharing moments with friendship, revelation, and short passion - but each knowing that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, leading to the movie's sudden bittersweet ending. This is almost a two-handed (with all other signs - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block where the story takes place in its entirety - which includes Loren's gruff and fervent patriotic man, surprisingly played by John Vernon, shown only at the beginning and final sequences); The tight attitude does not deter the Scola instructor (for the record, this is his 7th movie, which I have seen and own 3 more at VHS) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so the result - key - is far from stagy: the camera is allowed to prowl over the different parts of the large building, observing the matter intimately or uncomfortably as the situation requires, but always sharp. <br /> <br /> The story, of course, depends entirely on the two star performances for it to be convincing and they deliver both (their screen chemistry is quite incomparable); Interestingly, while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf, it is Mastroianni's moving, but unimaginative, outsider (the film seems somewhat doubtful to equate his sexual aberration with anti-fascism!), Which generally impressed the international audience!
