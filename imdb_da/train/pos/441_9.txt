This is an exquisite film about the search for any bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera's work, the emotions, the joking musical score and the sheer charm of this image make it a must see. It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunned. The only mistake I can see about this movie is that it was not captured in a more technically perfect movie format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the very best audio format available. (An intimate movie can be made in seventy millimeters.) The effect of the beautiful Italian villa on its inhabitants would have made even more luxuriant and the small delightful moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as a sweet moving little movie. I can't stop myself from seeing it every time it comes on satellite. The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and distrustful are always a joy to look at, and I should really recommend it more often. The molding is perfect, the atmosphere is perfect, the play is over told. It's a film about the Middle Ages and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful without hitting the viewer with a heavy hand. See it in a meeting and let it have an effect on you. If you don't, you may not have lived enough or something else is wrong with you.
