Remember H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man"? Well here is another movie like that, only more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story of invisibility as an optional weapon. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius that goes into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. By first making the serum the easy part, which made the person back, it was not. Most of the first attempts ended unstable. Until one night, he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost dead, so when he got there it was close. So when it did Caine, he decided to use it for fun. So when he got tired of not being seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of meat. But the visibility formula does not seem to work as it should, and Caine would die in madness. So he ends up being a crazy invisible killer. It would be best to just get out of town instead of killing people who are close to you. I would worry less about those who made you wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
