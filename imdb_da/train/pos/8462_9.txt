I just recently bought the collection one of this amazing series, and even after just seeing three episodes, I am still fascinated by the stylish styling of the animation and history's past but meticulous actions. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. Although this episode in the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish satirical way of telling about the accidents of war and not getting rid of the need to have control or power all over (sound known?), I must say this is a bit too mellow-dramatic by continuing to explain the life of the protagonists and their incessant needs for abdominal pain about everything that happens and what to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character is called Wufei ... I think he whines more than an American character on a soap opera advisor, do you want to?) Besides the exaggerated drama (I think most of it comes from the duplication of the English voters), this is series still very exciting and will still impress me again. I think it can always be worse. It could be like the recent rate, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic .... I'll talk about one later.
