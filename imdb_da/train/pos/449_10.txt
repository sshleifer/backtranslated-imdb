For anyone who judges others at the first meeting, here is the perfect guide on in-depth character. The grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The fleeting, insecure, ditsy lady who makes inappropriate, unpleasant comments - looks deep into your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, primary, neglected wife has passion slamming that could boil for a moment - given the right attitude. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by throngs - wants peace, tranquility and love without possession. <br /> <br /> Taking time to look beyond the surface, you'll find everyday life treasures from the least-anticipated sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
