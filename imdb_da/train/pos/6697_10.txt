I remember first seeing Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK at ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am now 24 and now love it as much as I did when I first looked at it. I get a little stick from some of my friends to still see a "kids show" but I don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan became one of my favorite characters as well. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honoring Sabrina at Nickeleoden UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was fantastic in "Clarrissa Explaining All" but so much better in this. I was jaded when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in England - I come first in the queue! lol x
