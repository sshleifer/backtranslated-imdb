How can a movie with Curtis Mayfield song be bad? It can not! Groove Tube is a series of scatological black-out sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The heights (Koko Clown, Easy Lubricating Recipe) exceed low (one too long "The Dealers"), but even the lows are fun. Best of all, Ken Shapiro's manic dance is down a busy Manhattan pavement. (It's Shapiro, not Nat King Cole sings Just You, Just Me). Absolutely dated now, but at that time Groove Tube was irreversible, bold, shameless and hysterical fun. Ken Shapiro made this less cool hit, so 7 years later, Christmas Day's opening bomb, modern problems (although I enjoyed it} and then unfortunately nothing. (He might play drums in a jazz group) Groove Tube remains for me an endless outbreak of positive energy, a movie that 26 years after my first show still gives me real joy!
