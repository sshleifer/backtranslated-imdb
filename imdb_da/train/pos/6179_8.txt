It's good to see that Vintage Film Buff has categorized their excellent DVD release properly as a "musical", because that's what this movie is, clean and simple. As its unofficial recovery, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show featuring Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, who lead a caste of super-decorative girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace , Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also ready to lend his strong voice to "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly, the movie's most popular song does not belong to less than four times. But it is Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with the reproduction of "Sweet Marijauna", but her strong performance as the hero's rejected boyfriend. As for the rest of the casting, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is overloaded and overloaded, superdumb Inspector McLaglen simply can't put his hands on the killer, even if you think, in this case, the person you suspect most . Director Mitch Leisen really goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the stupid member of the cinema audience by giving the involved player a close-up close-up.
