When I first saw this movie on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints a precise picture of South and racist attitudes. Most attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses prisoners for work. Soll is what makes the movement, his fun ramblings give us insight into the way the sewing was then. I suppose if Soll lived today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitudes toward a little boy who is going to work for him and the prisoners are complex. While having racist views, he is the adult to rely on some of the judges who are all black. The two prisoners he trusts the most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversation between Ben and Soll is the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in good performances as well as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should have received more notoriety. But it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
