Cross-eyed is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and restores it well. This movie is smart, concise and consistently entertaining and fun. As a writer / instructor, Jones has complete control over his characters, who are both absurd and lovable. History is certainly something you have not seen before, which is good. It is unique and fun and manages to work in visually stunning elements as well as the long-lost lost slapstick genre together to form a cordial comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first movie.
