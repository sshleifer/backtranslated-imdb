************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason I saw this movie and that was because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer. I don't know much about humor) There was a lot that was fun as Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealers and the President shit. Think that this is sometimes break time (dare I say raw?) It was sometimes fun, but it could have been better. Probably if they spent more time in humor and less time getting women to dress, the movie would have been more fun. Some sketches just make you want to gag and cring, other skits make you laugh and strangely think. Unfortunately, this movie is dated. If you have a mad food at Richard Belzer (so it's worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing Chevy Chase.
