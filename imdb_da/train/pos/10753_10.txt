To those who say this movie deserves something under the unflaunting grace it showed, I disagree. This is a fantastic documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I ask you to consider that the documentary was made. The courage that it took to shoot this movie is most remarkable. We find out that the two brothers are divided when that moment has happened. They continue to document the bravest to the brave without knowing about their own and each other's security. Judging if it is more noble to shoot a video of this tragedy or to save the lives of the amazing, amazing firefighters, is not mine to answer. I just know that for 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I send a wholehearted 10. Therefore, the art of filming is created! To capture the natural feelings that real life offers. You can keep your Kung Fu junk. Romance is sweet. The action will never reach this level. This film, the 9/11, will be timeless because it does not glorify itself. It didn't have a sneak peek. It did not have all the blatant vanities that a leaf portion of the many films on the many screens blur. It had class, tranquility and substance, and it had an overview of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. It spoke of things inevitably for the camera's eye. Please consider this movie as it itself declares, a shelf for all those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America. How can you give something less to a movie that shows, not decorations, the natural courage of real people in unreal times. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is forever another kind of movie, as it is now another kind of world. It is art without questions or questions. <br /> <br />
