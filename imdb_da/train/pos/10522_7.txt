This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. The cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border of gimmickry, but at least it avoids the trap of making this look like a dull TV soap in costumes, as the whole story is dialogue driven. <br /> <br /> The action is competent. Mrs. Paltrow is dismissed as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she doesn't seem to break enough of the results of her match-making efforts. Some of the supporting casts are guilty of overpowering - much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - without his fault, except having left such an impression as a gay dolly in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept that he plays someone serious role. Acceding honors go to Toni Collette, who manages to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northam, who puts his character on the right level.
