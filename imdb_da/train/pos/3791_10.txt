Our song is a wonderful example of passionate, filmmaking at its aesthetic best. It is actually a real wonder of a movie; a pervasive and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner cities (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives, when the confusion of their nearby adulthood will force each of them to change a number of difficult lives choices that are likely to define who each of them is, and how they will continue to relate to each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and precise. There is no juicy, bold sentimentality, nor are there clich√©-red solutions in this movie. What we see here sometimes seems to be heartbreaking. There is a naturalism - a credibility if you like - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its main players. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and of course blatant blunt - to dismiss, as some seem to have, the notion of these three as apathetic or unemotional. In fact, their tranquil charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film are quite rivets. One should be completely "out of touch" with or totally indifferent to the teenagers' behavior to miss the resounding authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Similarly, the support frame, especially Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, complements the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie not to be missed - by anyone of any age.
