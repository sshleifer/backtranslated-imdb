I give it only 9 out of 10 because I have to see it again, in a more current frame of mind to get a new perspective. What I remember is a fantastic psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and eyes when I saw it. I would see it every time it came on HBO back in the day (probably 1990 or so). I might even have recorded it, but the recording is far away, I'm sure. I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title in, they don't currently carry it. I hope I can find it on a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend trying it if you find it somewhere. At least that's interesting. If you've enjoyed movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or some sort of weird and along these lines, try this out.
