Although I didn't start reading the classics in literature before I was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is not a part of the book I liked less, only parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV mini series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was all I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Dalton is' Mr. Rochester 'was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah's' Jane Eyre'. Releasing another 'Classics' movie I saw recently was disappointed with production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to Hollywood's mockery and arrogance. Artistic license for the major works in the literature is nothing short of plagiarism. Using the title after such a license is fraud. Leave it to the British to get this right (among others). You cannot reload the book without reliving the movie with the right context and spirit. Well done BBC.
