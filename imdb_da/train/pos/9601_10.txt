Darius Goes West is a great documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends taking him on a cross-country trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" will pimp out his wheelchair. <br /> I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. It played twice during the festival. This film is a wonderful story of the human spirit and the spirit of Weem's friends. I'm not often talking about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something about the cause. Each festival, this film has participated in, this film has won a prize of some kind. It is at the Tribeca Film Festival and it comes to London and Athens, Greece. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie went all the way to the Academy Awards. It's snowballing out of control. If anyone has a chance to watch this movie wherever it plays, go! Take as many people as possible and go! It's on its way to New Orleans for a movie festival, then on to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect Atlanta tickets to be sold out quickly if they aren't already. Please see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
