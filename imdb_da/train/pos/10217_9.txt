The fluttering wing of the Atlantic Ocean can release a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to Chaos Theory, I'm not sure exactly how) any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to major events. This little jewel of a movie shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each other's lives. (The six-degree separation theory can also be used.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this movie. The action is fine-tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is bright), the stories are plausible, humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theater nodding in agreement.
