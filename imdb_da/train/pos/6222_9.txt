This is really a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics, and the dance of Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically all Fred and Ginger movies are the same. After the song and the dance are over, it is the other characters in the film that make the film. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the subplot of the movie is why I see it again and again. He adds to this movie, it doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a good smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorite list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. Okay, so he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very sympathetic and could on some occasions rise to the top. All Fred and Ginger films had subordinates that were dependent on other actors to fill the space between the music tracks, otherwise the film would have to be shortened by approx. half an hour. I just wanted more people to appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.
