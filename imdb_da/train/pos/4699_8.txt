This made for crime what "Not Another Teen Movie" Did For School. I laughed all the way as 2 invisible gangs were fighting with each other and with each other. An uninhibited comedy using open jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way. I suppose the biggest gag in the whole movie was that time never seemed to go ahead and leave the characters trapped in the 30s.
