Nick and Kelly are getting married, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change Kelly's honeymoon. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick loves to drink, smoke and play pool with the fellows for fun, but Nick suddenly escapes from this type of fun. Gender is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We find out that a foreign race is dying and has to interbreed with Earth women to save their population. It becomes a struggle for survival between humans and foreigners with the dog population also involved. A nice movie.
