This is not a movie for fans of the usual creepy Lynch stuff. Rather, it is for those who either appreciate a good story or have become tired of the giant things of overtly sentimentalism and Oprah-ish. "This is a wonderful movie! You must see it!" - semantics (tho 'she's right, for once!). <br /> <br /> The story unfolds flawlessly, and we follow a journey that I think most of us will recognize at some point. A compassionate, existential journey where we make changes to our past as we approach our inevitable death. <br /> <br /> It is without error, also cinematography (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue just goes to the viewer to understand the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A hot movie. Not excessive sentimental.
