This is movie that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and I'm glad he did! The mixture of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a lost medieval widow trying to maintain his lifestyle was a hoot. Add to the mix the reality of what is required to actually grow the pot (the plants under the bushes would not do so without the TLC they received) and it is a truly hilarious but touching film. I laugh every time I tell the vision of all the bartenders sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses when they count the lights down! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the British have decided this right !! 10.10
