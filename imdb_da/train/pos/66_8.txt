"Home Room" came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid a lot of time because it does not hold any strokes and what we see is how life is changed by an unhappy young man who decided to sacrifice his classmates, who are the innocent victims of his rash acts. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who works and edits his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing actions around his throw. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to attend high school. She has been away for a few years and does not seem to be in the same wavelength of the other students. For one she is a rebellion with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to get close to her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home where nine students died, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we are aware of, is a wounded girl who has undergone a terrible trial in her life, but we have no trace in that regard. <br /> <br /> What follows is the success of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should not have been in school at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. She tries to get over this dark period in her thoughts, but the nightmares don't allow her to forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. When she doesn't cooperate with the police, the school's manager wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state, and perhaps she'll soften and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia doesn't like Deanna, but in a few days both girls will make peace. We do not understand before the last order what really happened to the terrible day in school. Occupied Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen are just as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast as an ensemble. <br /> <br /> The movie has an intensity because it is not explicit to show how the shootings took place, helping the tone that Mr Ryan wanted to give this movie.
