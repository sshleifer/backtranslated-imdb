Plato's race is an entertaining b-movie with Gary Busey. It's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw it on a car start, I thought it was entertaining I was entitled to. Gary Busey plays Platon Smith a fierce mercenary framed by the murder of a strong Cuban crime On the way, Plato will have to survive enough time to prove his innocence with his friends, such as Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert) plays. what I liked about Plato's race was the way the movie never got boring, the plot could have been done before, but it was still good the play was fun to watch, and the action was also fun, and especially the climax Gary Busey does a good think ironic when he usually plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman does a good performance and he can't even act well to finish it off Plato's race is an enjoyable effort from now movie and I give the 7 out of 10
