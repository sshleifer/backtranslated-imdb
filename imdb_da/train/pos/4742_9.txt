This movie features more action before the opening credit than in all Hollywood movies of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many worthy Hong Kong movie productions, including Once Upon A Time in the China Series. The action was quick and furious with great management work. I only saw the wires in two shots. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and not only used as a filler. To find other action movies for rival this, look for a Hong Kong cinema outlet in your area. They are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint.
