This is a great movie that everyone should see. It plays like a Dean Koontz book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was great because it really seems to believe in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I don't know why viewers have to read in some sort of slander for religious murder in the movie. It's fiction. The ending is surprising, but fictitious. So what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILS DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVENT SEE FILMET. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by Paxton's disease, the child's influence and the way the children handle this monstrous behavior. And then at the end it turns out to be true. God has set him on a mission to free the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. Well, he gets information he couldn't have known otherwise, but the film goes on to show how God protects Adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the other FBI agent. The film does not speak for Christian murder, it only takes the viewer on a very unexpected trip.
