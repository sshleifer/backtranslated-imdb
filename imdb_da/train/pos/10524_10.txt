Jane Austen would definitely approve of this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job capturing Emma's attitude. She is fun without being overly stupid but elegant. She puts a very convincing British accent (I'm not British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fools me ... she was also excellent in "sliding doors" ... sometimes I forget she's American ~ !). <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as the Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and Ms Law doesn't even have any lines! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
