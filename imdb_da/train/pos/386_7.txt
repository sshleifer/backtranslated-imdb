Tsui Clark's visual art has been viewed in this film. Unfortunately, it's terrible that Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to choke her while I watched this, it's so bad :) made it hard to see at times. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw it, my jaw fell repeatedly, and I believed in myself that I have never seen anything distant like that, but so it must be done to make full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical king fu novels! Without a doubt, this is one of the most famous Chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather juvenile (his apparent occupation of the evil and too long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either). To make matters worse, this movie is very badly cast. They decided to use the "popular" Hong Kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are unfit for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystery that such characters are supposed to. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> One day, I want Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark to join together to produce a film that has visual art from Tsui, but with Zhang's maturity and storytelling poetry ...
