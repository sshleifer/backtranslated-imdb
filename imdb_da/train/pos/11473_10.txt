Zero Day is a movie that few people have seen and what a shame there is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters descend into space and mercilessly kill people, they commit suicide, and that made me grab my stomach. I shook it so strongly this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's too incredible not to get a perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this movie. It's not a budget that makes a movie good, it's the amount of feeling the decision makers put into it, which does well. <br /> <br /> It gives a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can't get out. It enables you to realize the real horror of shootings - especially if you need to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to see it. I'm fourteen, and I feel this movie is just too great to be put into words. It feels like you are seeing something that has actually happened.
