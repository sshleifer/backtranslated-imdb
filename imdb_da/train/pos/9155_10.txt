Who ever came up with the story is a sick person. I rented it to our sleeping party sleeper sofa and all six of us were freaked out because we were all in a play school together and we know a couple of the actors from the class. Besides everyone screaming all over the freaky night, I had freaky nightmares. I continued to think oh my God, if I come up to go to the toilet to pee, I'll be stabbed in the midst of dry or something. I couldn't even go to the toilet because we saw this horrible horror movie. I also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie, but we don't do any of the boys? You have to make a horror movie where the killer is a girl and chops units. I would see it again and again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I only give this movie a 9 because you FEAR ME FREAKS.
