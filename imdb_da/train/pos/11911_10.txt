The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both great at supporting roles in characters, both of which have more to them than what meets the eye. Jean Simmons is quite good and Trevor Howard makes a fascinating offbeat thrill.
