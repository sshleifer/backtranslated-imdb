I've loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how precisely Kurt Russell portrays Elvis right down to how he moves and expresses on his face. Sometimes it's scary how much he looks, works and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, this is being released on DVD, so everyone we've been waiting for can finally get an excellent quality full-length movie. I've heard the advocates saying that there are some inaccuracies or some things that have been omitted, but I think that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with and that this was shown on TV (only two years after Elvis's death!) that he did a good job on this. In fact, I haven't seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one. Highly recommended.
