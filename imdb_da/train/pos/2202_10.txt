I must only have been 11 when Mr Peepers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe in the sun. nights. Repetitive gags were Rob open his closet (he had to use a scale or point to get the right place on another cabinet and do some other things, and finally kicked the spot where his door would open) and take off a new one shirt at the start of an episode he would open a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show to find a button after the other that he missed when you unpack the clothes, the timing was all and the pins got plenty of laughing.) I remember an aunt who drove a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. He wanted to think and come up with "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis that made her say how brilliant he was. (you should have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why didn't they continue the series from her POV when Wally stopped (he was afraid he was typecast but then it was too late), I never know. I saw somewhere that 1. The TV wedding (big in anyway) was little Tim at the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I ever had hots for her) and I remember making the TV Guide the guide and got the pressure on all the papers and magazines. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC many years ago was disappointing as they had very few episodes so and they could be gone now. I still remember it as wonderful and wish I had been a little older.
