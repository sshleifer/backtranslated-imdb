"Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too quickly in the 1980s. And, unlike the teenage chamber committees that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie keeps going well. <br /> <br /> Its theme for teen anxiety is just as relevant today as 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and Sk8er Boi Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a nice young cast worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The movie follows four Southern California girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and without parents. Teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts or out in the street. Rarely are they at home because immediate gratification is a pill, party or boy away. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the movie is sympathetic to blaming absent-minded adults for forcing teenagers to grow up alone. And the charismatic casting is impossible to dislike. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie ?? a long and loving pot - sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at dawn amidst the objects that define teen girlhood, from Twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" is scored below. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie picks up speed as the girls go to school and to life. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild child living to the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the boy's crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl in her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It is her job to keep this crew together for long enough to finish high school while keeping her sign and desperate man on the hunting mother in line (Sally Kellerman). It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> Despite its age, "Foxes" is still a pleasure to see. Dated hair, clothes and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill has not hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The chemistry is simply amazing, with breathtaking filtered shots of the L.A. basin at dawn, dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80's soundtrack with eg. Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But maybe as Bowling for Soup song "1985", they just hit a wall.
