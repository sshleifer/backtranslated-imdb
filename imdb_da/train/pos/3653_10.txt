Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this regular movie ??? !!! The cast gives some good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin, a guy forever diminished by his disturbance), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT that interesting and original. I can't believe a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): Are you CRAZY ??? !!!
