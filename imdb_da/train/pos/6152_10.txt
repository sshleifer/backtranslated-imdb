Fabulous, amazing, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I have loved this movie for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. Even in spite of the stupid "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialogues are magical and fun. Could they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can't think of anyone more suited to the role. Remaking this classic would be as stupid as restoring Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson shone completely in this adventure, even though he had few quality film roles. He was a comic genius that is often forgotten today. Blocking, prim and proper English - no one could really slapstick and pull it out as gracefully as he does. It would be tragic to re-record this movie because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and no one could get into his shoes and do his character justice. The dancing nightgown and armor have a magical aura about them, which other movies with witches just do not catch. I especially enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house, and she must defend it in every way she can. <br /> <br /> Bobbing along, bobbing along the bottom of the beautiful briny, ocean. Richard and Robert Sherman attacked themselves on the songs. Everyone is amazing and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still stops today !!
