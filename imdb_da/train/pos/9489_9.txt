I'm not tired of saying this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state, but it is of course about the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (= Oswald) and even though all other officials will close the case he is constantly investigating with his team. <br /> <br /> The play is written tight and fast and keeps the excitement to the end. Only the part dealing with the Milgrams authorities experiment is (but not uninteresting) a little out of place. The end sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partially shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
