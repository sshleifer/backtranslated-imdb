I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel for. The young man left from the service still in love with the girl he left. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic leadership as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The appearance he gives her as if he has been starving for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as for her feelings for him was played very well. The rest of the splendid signs in the store were perfect when they tried to bring them together. The most touching scene, however, was the young couple at his grandfather. I laughed at parts, shouted in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I have seen it again about 5 times. One particular must look for totally romanticists.
