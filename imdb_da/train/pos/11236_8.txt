For the plate I am not affiliated with the production in any way. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie with most episodes produced to date. During 7 seasons (this is the last) they have made about 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> This is nothing mediocre on almost no budget and all volunteers time and energy. <br /> <br /> By their own admission, the previous seasons have not as good production competences as they did later, but as they progress, the green screen works and everyone acts. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "dip in" so started from the beginning and looked all the way through. HF enjoys history arches as well as all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely embedded in the Star Trek universe where it is tuned. Characters and "relatives" from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feelings of the stories, sometimes the improvement of the characters over the original. <br /> <br /> The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper wheel, a high membership forum attended by many actors and production staff and a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for high definition, high budget productions, it's probably not for you. <br /> <br /> Looking for continued adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that make Star Trek credit and make you think, it is here.
