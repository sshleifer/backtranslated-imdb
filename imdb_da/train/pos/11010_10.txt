When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and asked for existence and identity, many films were expected to use it as inspiration. It did not happen quite surprisingly, and it took in 2002 to watch a movie with similar theme. But to say that Cypher is a clone, it would be wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is a Morgan Sullivan applying for a job with a high tech techno company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a rival company while under an assumed and false identity. His home life is quite normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he actually does. But things begin to take conspiracy turns, and before he knows what's going on, he begins to question who he actually is. This is not helped by a strange woman who turns out ... Turns in each direction keep you completely fascinated, and at no point does anything ever seem constructed or incredible. <br /> <It is an exciting journey through a not too distant future, and with good acting all the way around you are on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
