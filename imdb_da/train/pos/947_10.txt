and possibly closest to Dickens history line. Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to see (who was the idea that the hair in the hair could have done better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. His delivery of some of the Dickens lines gave me life. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more of the Ghost of Christmas gift. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge much more of a credible miser than the more current version by Patrick Stewart. The scene of Christmas morning when Scrooge realizes that he has not "missed it" is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act with respect to overtime. He's phenomenal here. Almost the whole cast is incredible. The little Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little hard to look at, almost too sweet. Still music and scenery make this a must see every holiday. Enjoy!
