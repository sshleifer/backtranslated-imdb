What can be said, really ... "The tenant" is a first-class thriller made with equal amounts of excitement and full blown paranoia. It's an intricate plot movie - every detail seems to be included for a reason - even though the plot rarely makes sense, and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. Therefore, we are back with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a gentle Polish man who has achieved an opportunity because of the previous tenant's suicide - to lead us through a world of escalating fear and insecurity. After a home-warming party thrown by a group of unpleasant colleagues, Trelkovsky comes under increased apparent inexplicable investigation of the citizens of his building; The rest of the film chronicles his mental degradation and gives us a thorough reminder of David Lynch's later efforts. The "tenant" is, however, more exciting and scary, twisted with unexpected comic relief, fine performances and a really joking score. It's a movie that is better experienced than described, so hop on it.
