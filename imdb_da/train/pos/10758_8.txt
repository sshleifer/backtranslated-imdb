9/11 is a classic example of cinema verite, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case of New York firefighters, fighting against one of the world's most unusual events. It's all small, discreet, handheld camcorders, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the movie (and by the instructor, Naud's hand often releases the screen). <br /> <br /> In this movie Knowledge of most firefighters - Tony Benatatos, rookie (or "probie", in the NY firefighter language), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who thinks he lost his brother later) and a few others . There are study interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal, reflective nature of the events. The structure is quite dramatic and well done, especially the fire brigade delivery ceremony with a few useful swish pans and some kind of dialectical editing of the rather limited film work (like Rob Reiner's A few Good Men). Tony looks proud. The view and the camera angle are usually from the firefighters, which is interesting and there are some good footage from the inside of the WTC1 lobby, while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - this is classic cinema verite. There is also the creepy, scary sound of the occasional human body rushing towards the porch outside. It is then that a more abandoned fire chief Pfeiffer realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and that is before WTC2 collapses. You need to give credit to Naudet to know which faces to be filmed and anywhere. <br /> <br /> The sound of the nearby WTC2 collapse is so sad, exciting and frightening that you realize what an ordeal is for the firefighters. From the lobby it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world, and the poor firefighters look so confused and frightened. You hear a tremendously shaking, trembling meal stream - like a gigantic monolithic animal slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded - the nearby tower coincides, but the fire back in the WTC1 is unaware of this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This movie is captivating, but the story is amateurish and should have been avoided - cues like "this was really a day like no other" or Naud's often banal statements like "you could see fear in everyone's eyes" and 'I knew Tony was freaking out'! The movie is really just a long video diary. There are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firefighters have gone. Imagine this movie mixed with CCTV footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day. The effect would be greater. You can even combine this story with Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who literally had many floors to trade the hero. <br /> <br /> I can't see much of a propaganda element in this movie that some reviewers suggest. This movie is not Will's Triumph, by Riefenstahl. Some time later, the firefighters draw the American flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some moments of questionable camera work; For example, who holds the camera when the two brothers Naudet are reunited back at the fire station? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish, much in the traditon of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, shimmying.
