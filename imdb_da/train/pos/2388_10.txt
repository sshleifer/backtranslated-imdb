I love Doodlebops. My son has seen them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year and a concert yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops does not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? The TV does not assume to teach your children numbers or the alphabet. The parents must. Get over it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have good singing voices and do not load NOT Imagine, they dance, jump around and still sing. they have talent, the kids love them, I enjoy watching the show myself. This show is by far the best show on TV for kids. AND a rock band for kids. How amazing is that? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear it from? Whether he is or not, he is amazing! Let him be. It is not like he or anyone else promotes homosexuality to our children!
