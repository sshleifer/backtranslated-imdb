I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not shown. She was excellent in the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great as well as Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Grampa.I bought season I on DVD and I can't wait to buy seasons 2-6. If only there were more shows on TV like this, everything would be better. This show appeared shortly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all the dismissed members of the cast and thank you, Llydia Reed, again making yourself known to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
