there must be a subgenre in the western called 'Robert Mitchum Western'. Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually underrated western imports his film noir persona to noble some compelling dark character sketches and bring an elegant world crotch more widely known from the Sam Peckinpah films. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it's a sharp, black and white beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and scary outbursts of violent violence, as Mitchum is going to tame a city terrorized by a monopoly with a private army. Mitchum's regression from the soft-ghost alien to the horrified killer, with a wide range of dark emotions between them, is a marvel of expressive physical acting.
