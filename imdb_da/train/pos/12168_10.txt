"A Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it's probably a good, fun comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee) who wakes up in the morning after his bachelor party without memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) is lying in bed. Before he can figure out what happened, he blames Becky for his opportunity because his fiance Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that you can imagine chaos. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" delivers loud grin. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that she is underutilized. Although she turns out to be more fun than Stiles' character, which is actually not that interesting. Of course, not all comedies are perfect. As I said, "A Guy Thing" is no classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
