Shirley MacLaine in another tailor-made role. As an aunt to a single mother in a 1962 working class Chicago neighborhood, the veteran actress gets another workout like a gutsy woman who won't let any setback defeat her success. The children, a pre-teen boy and girl, are drawn to their tense Aunt Zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her, and applied to all the wrong options eventually make them divorced from school. <br /> The plot is wisely encapsulated in the Cuban missile crisis with all the social consequences. Men build bomb booths, people watch news programs about what appeared to be the only television set, dining room, and general fog of turmoil and fear in the air. However, when a "harmless" miracle blows out of proportion, the clear conclusion gets the viewer to feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun is coming up tomorrow! It is clearly a small budget production, it is still a cute little movie, filled with the magic that Sunday matrices were made of. With a few choices "Oldies" thrown into an efficient soundtrack, the whole family is sure to enjoy this. ****
