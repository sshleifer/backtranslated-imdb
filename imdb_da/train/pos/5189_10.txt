Another Woo masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is a best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - larger centuries. <br /> <br /> Maybe hey is no more intellectual than many great directors ... But he is lyrical and spiritual idol for all free minds! <br /> <br /> His movie as the great poetry! Woo is a movie Sheakspeare! Woo is a movie Biron! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! <brHO> <br /> IMHO violent in Woo movies is not a director's bloodlust but an art tool. Themes of Woo movies are more humanistic, so more of the new movies.
