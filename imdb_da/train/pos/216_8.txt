Question: How do you steal a scene from an expert scene expert stealing Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man fashion? answers: quiet, deadpan and with perfect timing like George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I know nothing of Vaudeville, but it's still a favorite movie, the two leaders are fun, the script is fun, the direction and pacing very good. Richard Benjamin is very fun as a straight man - trying to get to Burns through the window etc. Even the small parts are big. There are so many fun scenes that Mathau turns up for commercial, Burns repeats his response as if senile ... <br /> <br /> A joy. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
