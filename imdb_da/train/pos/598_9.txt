Heres a funny fact, I was the child in the movie, one in the crib. :) I am 19 years old now. My parents took me to try the part we lived in Texas at the time. I think I only made 80 bucks for it, but I wasn't in it very long. My parents said I would cry as I was going to be happy and would be happy to cry. I was completely confused. Strange and funny fact, I suppose .. and no I'm not a child actress. I'm in San Antonio, working on a walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This film is a good movie, but good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
