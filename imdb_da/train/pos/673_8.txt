Across the vast sharing we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about what was explained by the early tribal age. In each case there is a lot about the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, those who warn us not to prepare for what they are warning about are the 'end time'. In this movie called "The Last Wave," an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent unless they interfere with the order of the order. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defense lawyer to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by a sympathetic aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend the offense as a tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The film is filled with enigmatic, dark, vain images of apocalyptic world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and judgment. Black drama and deep rituals are what give this movie, it is frightening allure, and therefore it is not for the faint hearted. In fact, the simplest joking discoveries can last for years in the innocent movie's nightmare. Good quiet drama. ****
