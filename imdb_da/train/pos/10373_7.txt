Mat Spirogolous (Toby Malone) family knows that he is a talented football player and is happy to secure an audition to attend a large club. They hope that when he enters the city, his cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: one is a naive farm cushion, the other is a streetwise spending operation that has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters. Food is unlikely to have a quiet night before its big day. <br /> <br /> After missing out on his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat faces further troubles when a young motorcycle walks him in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in the theater, puts a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are countless signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies, there is more fun, apparently more spontaneity and more charm than what is to be seen in the average Hollywood blockbuster.
