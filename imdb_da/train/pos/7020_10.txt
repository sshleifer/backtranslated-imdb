* I mark where there are spoilers! Total Comments: If you can take a serious movie, you should see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you're confused with what's happening! The film fits nicely together in the second half. I take my mom to see it again when the movie is officially opened. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to see this at a screening a few weeks ago when Will was about to promote the movie. He was great - spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the picture Will! About Will's Achievements: Many times when you watch a movie with an actor really famous for another movie / show, you always think of them in their current performance as you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I don't have the picture Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched this movie. He was completely convincing in this very, very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this achievement. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicting and troubled. He's sorry ... guilty ... very particular, but very scared. Very true to itself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow it will succeed in bringing it to life. About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a nice job depicting Emily, a woman very much behind her treasures. Maybe she's not the shining star Will's in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character hasn't had so much to work with as Wills did. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I didn't like the movie for the other half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the film that went into it, and nothing was sensible until the other part of it or so. But when things finally fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really hits you. <br /> <br /> It actually takes a lot of you to see. In the theater I was in, most cried at the end - even adult men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why, it's a very powerful moment ... ******* Less SPOILING ***** That's why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving away big things. I want to know too much about this movie really destroys it. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie I enjoyed, though. I will mention some of this here (without trying to give away much). <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben held in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense at all. There was a lot of talk in the cinema when people realized the reality of the fish. I hated Ben at the start of the movie. At the end of that, I loved him and hated him. How convinced Will was. I thought Ben was a big dunk to Ezra, a blind man who just tried to make his way into the world. Why he treated Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the film. Wait, though. Everything in this movie: wait it out. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a basic good person who made a big mistake that he didn't want to forgive. It is still unclear to me whether he did what he did because he was trying to get rid of his own fault or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he would help people but also get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he does for himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job will.
