This movie is hard to see in our fast-paced 21st century culture, but it's worth the messages it brings, especially the impact and ramifications of technology on society, especially when this technology is used for warfare. /> <br /> This film presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization which is influenced by the emergence of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a warning of abuse of technology, but as the circle completes itself, Themes and emotions reappear to present self-service rather than self-destructive ways that mankind can utilize technology. <br /> <br /> Currently, image and sound quality can pose a challenge to some, but as a landmark in history, the evolution and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. Ultimately, free will and free choice is once again put to humanity as a means of controlling our own destiny rather than having it served us by another or indeed the very state of society as shaped by world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are dimmed by the life throwing their way are often inclined to remain so, but there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains as this film sets. br /> <br /> As far as qualification as sci-fi is concerned, one of the greatest common deminators of the genre is the speculative nature. It asks us the questions, what if these events happened in this way, and what effect would this have on society or the individuals in it? How do we respond? <br /> <br /> In terms of influence, this film projects the speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us pose the important issues.
