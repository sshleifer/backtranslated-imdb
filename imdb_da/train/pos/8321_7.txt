This is a comfortable movie, although the premise is stupid. It was kind of a guilty pleasure to see. Meg Ryan seems to be able to draw roles in this kind of movie (another example is Joe vs Volcano). That's what makes her a star, in part. Of course, Walter Matthau also had that ability, and he really sets himself in the role and makes a fun, kind hearted Einstein. I suppose you can say that they are both good at portraying loving characters, although they are lovable in different ways (lovable young women vs beloved curmudgeon).
