Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the latest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program "Blackbriar" to make supermodels like himself . <br /> <br /> I was so psyched for this, as I looked at the predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I remember, and superiority remains the weak (but still pleasing) link in the weakest plot chain and, apart from a billiard, which this movie's chase easily peaks, a little lacking in action and excitement. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, has Ultimatum excitement! Even when you know, Bourne will escape the authorities (and boy makes these movie spotlight police unlucky), it is still glorious to see him do it. It is fun to think that two guys with small arms and mopeds can create 10x more excitement than what the 150 million giant robots did in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Lime it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of slider stedicam a la documentary, though he records characters that are far from commonplace in places like the CIA headquarters, where no one within 10 miles would be allowed to a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the Ultimatum action is nothing short of awe-inspiring, with various tools used as weapons like a candlestick, a bound book (I will never look at them in the same way again) and one electric fan (do not ask). The music also helped generate great excitement and there was hardly any moment to not nail over. <br /> <br /> The action is good and the development of Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" put his situation in a new strong sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve, but competence (which sounds less, but it really looks like Matt Damon could avoid the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This yearning of his for a real life could be boring and almost done in Supremacy, but only works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I am reminded of a scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond movie) in which Sean Bean's character asks James if the martyrs are sometimes screaming by all the men he's killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least contemplated) the meaning of action without purpose, meaningless life, and how the government has transformed men into resources. However, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of something. Side listing: It is always bothering me that even though it is a super spy and chased by the CIA, Interpol and the police almost anywhere he goes, Bourne never thought to make even the slightest attempt to pamper his moves or create new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and love action movie than the Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, that's probably the best action movie to come out this year. Of course, you would be a fool to see it without seeing the others first. It kind of draws close to the end, but I feel almost tempted to overlook it. This is the first "3" movie this summer to at least match if it does not exceed the original, and it says something. <br /> <br /> A-
