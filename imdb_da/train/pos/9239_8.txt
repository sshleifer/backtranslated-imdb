As I said in my first part comment: These two films are better than most science fiction fans recognize. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the second film is not so moving as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees flee into small space containers, protected by only a powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus pops up, the story ceases to lead the fight back to the Cylon planets. Okay, it has a little Mad Max because all they are struggling for is the fuel for their spacecraft to move on to find the distant land, but it works for me. It's exciting Science Fiction entertainment with fine actors and decent special effects (though they tend to repeat themselves, at least :-)). I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on the board. Instead we got another successor with no name signs that turned out that the story had worked before, especially because the characters were so well-chosen ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down to the production of 1980, but thumbs up up for the two films from 1978.
