Yes, this is an ultra-low budget movie. So the play is not award-winning material, and sometimes the action is slow because filmmakers shoot longer sequences and not a million instants, which are then edited for a movie. This movie features an excellent script that takes vampyrism seriously, explains it, and develops a full plot out of it. Apart from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics info, legal and law enforcement, martial arts actions, philosophical musings and some good metal music. Kudos goes to Dylan O'Leary, the director / author / main actor. It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them as well. I seem to appreciate this movie, you must be well versed in every possible theme to see that the author did a lot of research and knows all of these things. There is also a good camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack - something I haven't seen before, but which gives tribute to the underwater zambia attack in Fulci's Zombi. The molding is good, as far as the sexy woman is sexy actually. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that there should have been more nudity for a low budget horror flick. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. I look forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
