A long-lasting but convincing tale of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men and how they help each other out, but the other half is not as strong because of the elimination of the Biko character. Still, it is a compelling movie with great performances by Kline and Washington in the film that puts the latter on the card. Washington was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress for the first time. All in all, a well-filmed movie that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
