When tradition dictates an artist to pass on his great skills and magic to an heir, the aging and very proud street actor, known to everyone as "The King of Masks", desperately desires a young man's apprentice to adopt and worship. <His warmth and humanity find him pay a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case massive flooding in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new, 7-year-old companion on his strawhouse boat to live with his precious and beautiful monkey, "General," only to discover that his child is a female child. <br /> <br /> His life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl is rooted in the terrible tradition that requires him to pass his art only to a young man. There are many stories inside this ... many people are touched, and the culture of China opens up to our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. The technical transfer is not that great when I found the sound level throughout the meter and could actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
