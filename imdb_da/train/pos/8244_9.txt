Loved it! What you don't like? - you have your suburb, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have your social dilemmas, you got yourself a nice retro-1950's-style meat-eating during class held by the bay of an unpleasantly worried about whether they are the next meal top crust. You couldn't ask for more. <br /> <br /> Cast is amazing. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutant social climbing housewife. She is both malicious and criminally conspiratory. Every man's dream. K'sun is truly amazing, as the son just tries to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence and somehow succeeds. He is a true screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without mentioning them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with upscale instincts and a little squeamishness as if it were his daily persona. Billy Connolly is lovely as Fido. A fine actor: I wish he had played the title role in "Braveheart" with Gibson director. My understanding is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character. His Fido is included, but still available. A nice touch. In short, a great and wonderful satirical poke on morals, values, social pinnings, emotions, growth, clear uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A true reality show.
