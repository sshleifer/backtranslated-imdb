Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily poor Polish Countess in the 20th century Paris, who is persecuted by France's most popular general and a glamorous counter - and it is also engaged with a shoe size. Such is the incomplete premise that causes one of the most frightening plots in film history. There are backroom political machinations of the general's handles, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the shady upstairs / downstairs intrigue with ravenous servants and slightly more detained aristocrats. Yes, there are rules for the game redux. Before it is completely over, Gaston Modot, the jealous wilderness in Rules, shows a look - like a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast towards the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what is bad - Elena and Her Men are another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.
