This is one of the few movies I can see over and over again. If you've never seen it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together, and even though the film praises me a lot, it reminds me of Julia's unnoticed death. It is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us at this time of terror and fear.
