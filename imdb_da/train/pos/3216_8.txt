Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance of the ever-reliable Kurt Russell) gets dumped on a deserted remote planet after being considered obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (delicious game for the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs) who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered campaigners. Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-sufficient outcasts and defends this community when the new soldiers arrive at a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, portrays a chilling outlook on a gloomy, cold and hard-to-reach near future while maintaining a stealthy pace and a hard, greedy tone throughout. In addition, Anderson manages well-moving moments for humanity (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his formerly oppressed emotions is really exciting) and controls the moving action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime depiction of Todd; He conveys many emotions without saying much, and instead the majority of his actions work through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supportive turn of Jason Scott Lee as the brutal rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the friendly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as the stupid little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty spicy veteran Captain Church , Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible mayor Hawkins. Even better, this film sets out a profound and significant account of the spiritual prize of being a merciless soldier and of the importance of intellectual strength over physical power. David Tattersall's polished film, Joel McNeely's revitalizing orchestral score and top-notch special effects further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction / action hybrid outing.
