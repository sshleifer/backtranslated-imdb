And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book, as for all I know she could have done when she spoke Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> All four main characters are excellent, but the movie itself is a series of great images and better scenes held together by nothing. While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this asks too much of the viewer. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot of fun (which it is in parts) or quite scary (which is in a scene), but the director didn't know which way to go.
