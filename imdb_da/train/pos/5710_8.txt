Rene Clair's groundbreaking musical. If you want to see where songs first ran a story this is the place. This is the story of a starving young artist who finds that he has won the lottery, just as his creditors are calling. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and has been given to a captive convict who then ... oh, but it would tell. <br /> <br /> This is a light and scary story where much of the dialogue is sung (most believe this did not happen before Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they don't do anymore and rarely did when they did it. It sounds like a movie from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later. Clair moves his camera around in ways that did not even Busby Berkeley (although honestly comparing the two filmmakers, it is unfair, as Berkeley essentially made podium-bound dance figures, and Clair moved the camera through "the real world") . It's a great little movie. And it's a charming movie that just makes you smile. It's just a fluffy piece of enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't say more. It's just a nice little movie and it's really all you need to know.
