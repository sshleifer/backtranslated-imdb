I suppose this movie will only work on people who were all beaten by the great hype of the Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And then I really love this movie. I especially like all the flawless superheroes from LotR that are so perfect and disrespectful parodyed. Most brilliantly is the counterpart to Gandalf (the brave and clever and utterly humorous, the only-it-all guide): Almghandi, feud and brain death transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) carries a simple shovel with eye-holes as a helmet. The Aragorn's alter ego is yet another accident-limited idiot trying to straighten its broken sword ("Ulrike" legend) with Scotch tape. And "Strunzdumm" (the counterpart of Wormtong) actually has some resemblance to Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
