Of course, the plot, the script and especially the casting are strong in the movie. So many good things to see. One aspect I particularly liked is the antagonist's idea - Luzhini's (Turturro's) - ex-mentor works his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - an Italian dandy in three pieces and sugar cane - turns out to be a real gentleman and a really good chess player. To his credit, the "adversary" goes noble with the plan eventually to finalize the final game for the championship posthumously (Luzhin has taken a flyer out of a window - sad but so releasing to him) using the unstable genius' Widow ( Emily Watson.) In death is allowed to be played when Luzhin's defenses (which he performed in a late time with ease) due to an honorable chessman's gallantry. The Italian gentleman admires the piece and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "playoff"!
