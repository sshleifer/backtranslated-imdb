While this movie has many flaws, it's actually a fun 80's movie. Eddie Murphy peaks during his 80s movie here. While his character cannot be distinguished from previous films, his timing is almost flawless with perfect collaborators and foils. Couple this with the frequent beauty of Charlotte Lewis, making it a fun rainy day action-comedy flick. <br /> <br />
