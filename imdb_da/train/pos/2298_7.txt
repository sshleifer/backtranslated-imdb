I love occult horror, and the great British hammer studies that delivered one of their biggest films "The Devil Rides Out" (1968) have proved to be more than capable in this area of ​​Horror. This occult tenth episode of Hammer's short-running television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guard of the Abyss", is actually an eerie entry to the series. Managing Director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched the Hammer oeuvre with "Vampyrkyset" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two "Fu Machu" films with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the better ones well-known names among the HHH directors, and he also delivers here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old screaming glass. The screw glass is the case for the desire of a devilish worship that will use it for their satanic rites. When he commends a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor) to be sacrificed by the cult, Michael enters deeper problems with the cult and their outrageous leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of my absolute favorites episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best is clearly the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), it is a very creepy and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists and remains exciting and eerie throughout the film. Ray Lonnen makes a good management, young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is really scary as the leader of the satanists. Overall, "Abyssens Guardians" is another interesting and eerie HHH story, and my colleagues Hammer fans must not miss it.
