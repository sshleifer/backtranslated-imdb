I watched the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and is something I believe in the world and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is amazing. It's a very good movie. The characters were well-developed, and the film had a wide range of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titins, paid in full size), Brian J. White (Trois 3, 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Caribbean Pirates) . The film tackles many relevant topics in today's society in a short time, and does so with class and grace. This is not just a story of life in the hospital, but it is a story of people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they should be.
