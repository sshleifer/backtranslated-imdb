Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated movie. The best way I have been able to explain it is that it's pretty sour. Although it is not entirely random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, but Nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and capable of fetching half of it. The story is about their attempt to bring Nyaako back to life. Although much of the content of this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of it is symbolic of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This oddly cute short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the screen surface.
