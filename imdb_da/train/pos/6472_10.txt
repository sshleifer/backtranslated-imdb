One of the finest pieces of television drama in the last decade. Throughout the five hours, the perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is as usual brilliant. By first getting over like a heavily handmade copper in conflict with the hero, but then turns out to be intelligent and caring when working with her to uncover the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones before. I think she's coming from the television world. Her performance was magnificent as she maintained her humor and calm while trying to balance the demands of the case and stressed to look after her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this amazing drama, but their effort would mean little without such an absorbent script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programs like this that restore their belief in television drama, while making it almost impossible to settle for most of the waste, which increasingly fills the air waves.
