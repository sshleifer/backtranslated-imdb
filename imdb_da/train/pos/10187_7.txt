Well, I want to be honest: It's not exactly a Sholay. But you can't get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see different signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. But as most "inspired" movies go, this one was well-inspired, well-handled and well done. Nana Patekar has the usual tendency to exaggerate his hysteria, but everyone else is commendable. Especially at Dipti Naval: Watch her for a long time, but she has not lost any of her grace. In fact, she did much better when I last saw her. Another of the Bollywood stars seems to grow more beautiful as they age. All in all, a good watch.
