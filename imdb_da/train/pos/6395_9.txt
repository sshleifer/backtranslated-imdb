For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Surprisingly, racism that struggles through life and proves that he is not just a common "cookie", Carl Brashear is a great sign to play, who puts Cuba in its best light, the best performance in life. The Niro, who is a living legend, gives something to the movie.Hat his character in movies, but he gives so much good acting to this movie, excellent performance.And the appearance of beautiful Charlize was and as it is always a big plus for every movie. So, if you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend those who love courage, greatness, seeking inspiration. You must see this great drama. My vote 9/10.
