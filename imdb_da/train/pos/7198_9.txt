This is a really good movie and one that I have enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine is amazing as always. Michael Caine has got a good reputation for taking any role in any movie, no matter what quality or lack of the same, but he does a good job of playing Sidney. From the start it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such scary things as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something this witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how do you go wrong with a cast this well directed by Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I'm really reluctant to go because if anyone were to give away something about this movie, it would be a crime. Just see it and adorn it.
