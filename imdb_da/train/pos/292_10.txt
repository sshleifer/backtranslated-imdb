Okay, first of all, I got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was intended to be in stereoscopic 3D. It is mostly, but when the protagonist is in his car, the film falls flat to 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to film in a car !!! OTHER - The story is not very good. There are many things wrong with that. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why do they show all the deaths at the start of the movie! It made the movie suck when some were killed !!! Watch it for a good laugh, but don't waste your time buying it. Just download it or something too cheap.
