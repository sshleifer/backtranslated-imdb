I thought this movie was hysterical. I've seen it many times and highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, was excellent. Cast was amazing .. I don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I loved it .. I've seen other movies of his and they were also fun, but this one really sticks out in my mind because of humor .. His just can't say enough about this movie. I'm looking for it to be on a regular basis, but it's never enough for me. The people who played the homeless, by comparison, were also up to the funniest standards. Please post this movie more often. I can't see it enough..Leslie Ann Warren was also another favorite of mine ever since Cinderella. I always thought she wasn't really fun, but loved her acting. In this movie she was very funny .. and her and Mel did a good job together. They should put more of his films on TV.
