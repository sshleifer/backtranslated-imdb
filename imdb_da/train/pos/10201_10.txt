It's a very good movie not only for fans of Lady Death comics but also for those who like animated movies / series of adventures and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is about to be killed for something she had not done, but for whom she is the daughter of hell's ruler, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then she seeks revenge ... and the rest you see better from the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form Chaos. I have never had the chance to read the first parts of the story in comics, only the last, after the passengers in the movie, so I can't tell you whether the events are like the comics, but ... somehow the other is the story of Lady Death!
