For a movie that is apparently about sex and leather, it is not right to be as strange as it is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the south who is Mom, would not let her die until she married, who moved to New York and ended up being the most successful pin-up of her age, driven by a excellent performance from Gretchen Moll. Her side cannot completely reconcile the pictures she takes (no one is allowed to touch, it's all fun and respectful) with pornographic trials and suspected bad effects that her pictures have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> Since then, it has been an inspiration for every burlesque artist since, not just because she had a figure to die for, but because she invested each image with an innocent fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time . Instead of this movie, in fact. Filmed in both black and white and brilliant technicolor, it's a great way to spend a few hours on.
