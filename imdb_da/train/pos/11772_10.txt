In another of Bugs Bunny's hare-shorts, the famous leporid * works in a department store when the owner Gildersleeve decides to stretch him. This obviously shows almost impossible, as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and when to cross). As always, they keep everything at the highest speed, and then you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have appeared when it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a fine example of how Looney Tunes looked in the '40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But don't confuse me, the drawings were still really good after the refined forms arrived. <br /> <br /> Yet, this is a good thing. <br /> <br /> * Leporides are rabbits and hares.
