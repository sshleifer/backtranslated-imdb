I admit I'm a vampire addict: I've seen so many vampire movies I've lost count, and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with the original John Carpenter's Vampires, and when I uncovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it. This movie doesn't quite follow the same rules as the first one, and it's not quite as dark, but it's close enough, and I felt it built nicely on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was sympathetic and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe he could actually survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorites parts were right after he met Zoey and walks into the bathroom at supper to see if she is more than she thinks. His remarks are beautifully annoying and yet very practical, which contrasts with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were also well-chosen and they knitted well to produce an entertaining and original movie. It's not just a rehash of the first movie and it has grown the same way Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I'd recommend this one. If you prefer your movies less bloody, then choose something else.
