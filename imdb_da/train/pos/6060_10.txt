This is a great documentary. Any fan of car driving must own a copy of this excellent movie. Director "Stephen Low" did a great job as well as the film's most important stars, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds great. And best of all, it's IMAX! Large home theater test disc.
