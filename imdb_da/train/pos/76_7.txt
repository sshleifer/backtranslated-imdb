Vincent Price's follow-up to the HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that cemented its reputation as a horror icon, is also about a bitter? carefully? showman. Although a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the overall effort; who said, apart from some resilient comic relief, the mandatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative gossip (what happened to the missing bag that apparently came up at a police station with a cut off head? ), this gives more than enough Guignol-type excitement and total camp value (price hamming it up in a number of disguise as inventor of illusions that translate 'missing' star comrades who had exploited his genius) to stand on their own feet. Incidentally, Director Brahm's involvement does not prove to be a coincidence here? When the story incorporates elements from two horror titles (both with the lead role Laird Cregar), he previously had hell, ie. LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young leaders are played by Mary Murphy (as Price's Genuine Assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (as his police detective lover 拷 斤 拷 probably curiously, he would himself lead the way in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this). An interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a new detection technique, fingerprints, which is essential to achieve Price's downfall (in a predictable but rather unpleasant burning climax)? Although the persistent snooping of his amateur crime writer is at least much to do with it in the long run! Looking at the star in a purposeful role, does the film come out a lot of fun? especially in a compact 73 minutes.
