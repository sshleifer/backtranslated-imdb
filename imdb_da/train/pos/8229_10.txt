This is a rather slow paced movie that slowly builds the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, even though it leaves a little bitter taste in the end. It is wise, well paced and very well acted. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that doesn't look like one. A very unconventional movie, very special atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel awkward a few times with a few scenes. I give it a 8/10 !!
