24 have to be the best spy / adventure series TV had ever aired. The whole idea of ​​telling a story in a 24-hour real-time is dazzling. The movie and pacing style is what hooks us to see it. And Jack Bauer has long been one of the biggest protagonists in a television series. I rate this along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three most preferred TV shows. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to murder US Senator David Palmer, who is also president. Bauer is called to her office to discover who is behind all this, and at the same time draw her daughter's way to the undamaged when she flies from her bedroom. Thus, an adventure in the best political style begins, and best of all, it always happens in real time, making this TV series a true original work at a time when almost all programs on TV appear to show them same thing over and over and over again.
