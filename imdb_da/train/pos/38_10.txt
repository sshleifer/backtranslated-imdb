One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. An eerie house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenges Alert Detective Agency's best men. Shemp is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his Mr. Goodrich's role as a target for a murder plot. Before it is over, Shemp's "credible little shovel" is highly valued. This 16 minute gem moves as fast as any Stooge card and packs twice wallop. Highly recommended.
