Okay, then the plot is on shaken soil. Yes okay, then there are some randomly inserted songs and / or dancing sequences (for example: Adams concert and Henri's scene act). And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow, an American in Paris manages to get through it all as a polished, first-class musical-- mainly based on Gene Kelly's incredible dance dialogue and choreography, and the truck's charm seems to be importing into each scene with Caron. (He needs because she seems to have a ... problem with emotions.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the most successful and technically awe-inspiring song in this musical is the 16-minute ball towards the end of the movie. . It is amazingly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite song should be Kelly's character, who sings 'In Got Rhythm' with a bunch of French schoolchildren, and then breaks into a number of American dances. It just goes to prove how you do not need special effects when you have some real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the classic level with 'Singin' In The Rain 'but pretty high anyway. Worth to see!
