I am from Romania, I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. Seen it over 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things I like in a movie, it is very touching, makes me cry. Shows a lot of twisted love tendencies and questions of love and reality and the true things that matter to different people. It so happens that for me it means most, love, the soul of man, he is inner being, and what I see in this movie. Perhaps for me it is much more than a movie, it is a proof in my heart that it can really exist and that you make the most of every moment you live with your soul collector. It's far from the reality of sci-fi, but .. what if. What if all capitalism disappeared and the economy would go down would fall? We all wanted to worry about other issues, and my thinking is that the bigger thing you remember about your death bed is not wealth, not the adventure, not the countries you visited, and the people who remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that when you die, everyone will be goddess perfect, and people would be good and care more. Watch this movie and it will probably lead you through your life as it did for me :) Hail from Romania
