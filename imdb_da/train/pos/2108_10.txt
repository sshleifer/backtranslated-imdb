A warm, sweet and remarkably charming movie about two antagonistic workers in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) carrying a romance via mailbox, without any of them knowing. The key to the film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and encourages his actors to give key, incomplete notions. As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this movie, which I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, most clearly represented in the character of the store's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is thrown by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the quirky romance between Stewart and Sullavan the more poignant because they both reach out to this unseen person, who each thinks of as a soul mate before they have met. Of course, we know that everything will turn out in the end, but in the movie you don't forget the gloomy feeling that one of them would feel if they found out that reality didn't live up to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his movie with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. The small group of business associates refers to themselves throughout the film as a small family, and that's exactly what it also works for us. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, unsung romance. <br /> <br /> Degree: A +
