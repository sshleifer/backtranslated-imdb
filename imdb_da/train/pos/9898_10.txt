My 10/10 rating is only for the fun factor and assumes that you have decided you liked "Slaughter High" even before you see it. Yes, this is the typical revenge-several years after a dirty prank story, but how do you not like some of the things they are pulling here? I couldn't have predicted the bathtub scene for a million years. OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie doesn't contain anything new. Well, it doesn't pretend. It's the kind of flick that the characters in "Scream" probably saw, and it contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to see people like to do these things? It is clear that it is in the form of a reactionary undertone when people are punished for doing what the 60s met. But still you must love these things! So, with excuses to Don McLean, this jester did not sing to the King and Queen!
