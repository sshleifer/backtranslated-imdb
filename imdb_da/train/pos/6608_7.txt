There is about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. Beginning with existential themes from Blade Runner and future vision - with the company's billboards advertising their products, the technology of later matrix films and Spielberg's AI, and finally, black and white graphic novel looks like in Sin City. The creators have put a lot of effort into the visual department, and the result is a well-designed future neo-noir. Add a detective story and you have an interesting movie. I know what it would be, but whatever the amazing visuals it was not enough to get it to the final destination.
