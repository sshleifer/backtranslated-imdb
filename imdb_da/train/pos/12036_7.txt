Why am I so convinced that there is actually another movie version of this novel out there somewhere? I watched the film again this year as I teach the novel and find the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the end has changed. They kill him in the movie, but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but reuses and eventually puts the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene of the movie, where Kipps set fire to the office, is plain daft, and the toy soldier's constant appearance to denote the child's presence is truly scary but meaningless - Kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and actually scary. Have I just imagined this?
