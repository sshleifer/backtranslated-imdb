Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered most today as one of the finest instructors in Hollywood history, but this film shows that he is. Already a success by making sophisticated American dramas as a letter to three wives and everything about Eva and successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a wonderful job of bringing this hit Broadway to movies and doing it in style . Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, though he can't sing too well. He is the only actor who could pull it out of his pure coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a great job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with good chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very fun bit. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz should get the most credit for bringing a fine musical own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes, but is still a story in its own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels, which normally should not.
