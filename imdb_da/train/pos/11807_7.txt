Having seen Dick Tracy in $ 6.99 bin at Future Shop, I decided to give it a trip without prior knowledge and be a big fan of Mafia and Crime. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves well together, of course, it has another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the movie are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as one of the top gangsters trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as a girl in need, she really impressed me and added the depth to her performance. If you go in with the attitude that wants to see a fun, smart movie with great plays and a solid script, then give Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. And look for the comers from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
