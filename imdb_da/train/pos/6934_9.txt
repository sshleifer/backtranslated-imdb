Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like about it. It's not your everyday Western - it uses a rifle that passes hands from various characters - as a mechanism to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian boss, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gal who has to cope with her husband and the wild west's reality. It is important to note the politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this film without remorse. With today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and worth seeing. Enjoy!
