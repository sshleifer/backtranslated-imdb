I'm not a Steve Carell fan, but I like this movie about Dan, a counselor who goes to his parents' house for a stay with his children and ends up falling in love with his brother's boyfriend. It is a story that has been told before, but not so. There are simply too many small bits that make the movie better than it should be. The throw is wonderful, and although Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as a widower who assumes to know everything but finds that knowing is different from feeling, and sometimes life surprises you. Sometimes witty and wise in the way an annoying Hallmark card can be, the movie is still some that can grow on you and be more than a run of the mill movie. Worth to see
