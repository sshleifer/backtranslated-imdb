Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French film center enters office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends her days doing other men's jobs, unredited and the source of their wonderful and lunchtime conversation, which is too clear to her to be partially deaf, she reads lips. A change has begun when she hires newly-paroleed con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, binds them. Carla is attracted to Paul and that he makes her feel attractive to what seems like the first time. Paul does nothing to remove his feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him who will involve Carlas's ability to read lips. I think the most important thing that pushes the film path over an average tension / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the film, no matter what other characters are on the screen, you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I can't remember when I have experienced such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French emperor for best actress). You never want to see a play, this is really Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and both times when I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the cinema and get involved in them again.
