I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Currently, all episodes are fun, personally I really like the episode of the French invasion, but one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also really fun, the way Rowan continues Playing with them is really (English) humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: "Never say it again, always call it Scottish Games; Blackadder: Oh, then you want me to say Scottish games? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ... ! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan, and I have the bulk of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series really good, and I hope Rowan will continue style, but I think we can count on him because he is already working on a Bean 2 Movie that will be out this year, I can't wait ... <br /> <br /> I give this 3. Blackadder a 9 out of 10 character.
