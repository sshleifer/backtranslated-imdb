Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during World War II. Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly like the great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in that era and of course the great movies of that late, great, Ms Bette Davis.
