With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor advises Finlayson peace and quiet and a diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes with a fantastic solution that lives on a docked boat, so the salt water can help Ollie with everything he needs. It is a good prerequisite for all the crazy heads to behave when the boat is set up by the hungry goat, and a escaped prisoner (Richard Cramer) collapses for the ride. <br /> <br /> I got a kick out of all the gags in the movie, starting with the sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Working'. The early history of the boys' apartment has a number of mixed heating of plumbing and appliances, where Stan makes a banana within a banana piece. Laurel has a few nice lines on the picture, like "We must be decoupled", but the one who made me roll was his answer to the criminal on board the ship - "Self-preservation is the last law on average" just as well! <br /> <br /> I'm not as much a student of Laurel and Hardy's movie as many on this forum, all I know, I enjoyed them as a kid and found them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that counter, "Saps At Sea" gives a decent hour's hornophobic fun, well on the way to hornomani.
