The movie Freddy is dead, the final nightmare is as horrific and disturbing as any other nightmare on Elm Street, yes it has Comedy essence about it, so has all the other movies, but how can anyone possibly say you wouldn't find Freddy Krueger scary, if you were to come across this man in your dreams, you would not find him even more frightening with a comical essence about him because his comedy shows he does not care at all to kill you that he finds it extreme fun, and Freddy also plays comic mind games with those who, in their own way, are very disturbing by using his comics, I think making horror movies Nightmare on Elm Street what they are today. The authors are extremely clever and make the Krueger cartoon and scary As an opponent of Jason Vorhees, who doesn't say anything and doesn't have to scare his victims really, this movie is just as good as Freddy's humor gets and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and by the way "does not fall asleep!"
