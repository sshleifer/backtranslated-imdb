I just got an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine abuser who turned to a drug-abused life on the streets after his bike trainer went to shambles as soon as it started. I must say that the story of his bike career was more heart-breaking than his drug abuse. Here is this young guy who wins left and right bike rides and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arrival, he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes ever to live, and are generally poor and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to do his act as such an ass? <br /> <br /> At least I was confused about how the show was put together as it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see pictures of him pan-action and sleep in gutters and ditches and even smoke crack cocaine. I didn't even know it was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film it? Do they do so in the hope that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> At least it's an enlightening show because it shows the effects of different addictions and overall control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to see because you really see how seriously the families and friends suffer from the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that it eventually seems a little too clean cut. There are times during the episodes when horrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a bit too much of a happy ever feeling in the end and I have a feeling that it is a very unusual event in real life. But is it still a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like that?
