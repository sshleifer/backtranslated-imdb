This movie is up there with full-time classics. The music, camera shots and plays are excellent. Showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better look and complemented the music perfectly, like Psycho. It is surprising how few people have commented on this movie. My guess is that it's a hard movie to find. I gave the movie a 9. Watch the movie and you know what I'm talking about.
