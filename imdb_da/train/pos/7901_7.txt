Worst movie all the time? Wow, who now? You can't be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about what you expect a movie to do for you. I live in Oregon, so I had to enjoy the beautifully shot of well-known but still stunningly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas of central Oregon (as well as the sweet como of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on baby Sissy's cradle at the start of the movie). They alone were enough to encourage me to give the film a better than "average" score. <br /> <br /> Or .... Maybe it's about what expectations you have. After reading the book AGES ago and thinking of myself "goodness, no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, nice book ... especially 20 years later when mores (MORAYS - can't put accent mark online ) has changed "- I was actually pleasantly surprised when I first saw the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today to see it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was exquisitely molded and I don't care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by Rain Phoenix and John Hurt's performances. I am not a lesbian or bi or trans but have met many people who are similar to the people they were supposed to imagine - and the "real" people used to act the same way these actors acted. Asked a bit, stage-ey - always a little "on." Gus Van Sant is a strange native oregonian, but by garsh he has done a good job of adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
