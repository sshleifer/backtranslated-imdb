All I can say is if you don't fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie then you're not human! Even after I first saw it, I was hooked. It's a fascinating experience that's hard to describe as I'm sure other fans will attest. After seeing it, you will cry to believe that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think we all yearn to have the violent independence with which these two ladies were pampered. Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she doesn't stay in your heart as Big and Little Edie do. What a rare treat to know about such people; I only wish I had!
