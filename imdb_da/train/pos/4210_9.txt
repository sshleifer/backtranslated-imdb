I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the movie were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the manuscript and the actor. This is certainly one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is absolutely convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely be looking for her second job. Thelma Ritter, in an honorable role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received to play the informant. This movie works at all levels. The black-and-white photography is quite appropriate, and the story hangs on the viewer right from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Highly recommended, 9/10.
