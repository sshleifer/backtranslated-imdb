I saw this on the plane for NZ last week and wondered how it would measure up to both the British film and the book. I must say I was positively impressed. About anything, the fanatical affiliation to the Red Sox over the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Brit, I was also interested in seeing that you do not need to understand baseball to get what is going on. One question jumps in mind - Was the manuscript written with Sox as the team, even before they finally broke Bambino's curse? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan himself (strange I know, a Brit who understands baseball), I have to say that it is added to the pleasure.
