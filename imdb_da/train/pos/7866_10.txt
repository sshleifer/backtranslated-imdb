PAGE 3 **** out of 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konona Sen) enters her boyfriend and is empty. She looks here and there and then goes into her bedroom, and you get the picture - 'Ah! another girl ?? the two-timing baddie and yes actually he his two timing her, but it's a GUY this time around. And I say 'Brilliant!' END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not a spoiler really ... but for me it was so I wouldn't take a chance) <br /> <br /> When asked how was this movie, my friend replied, " Oh, it's just an exhibition of the P3 people that made me think it was fun to see a silly movie, if not more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself: "I better get a pen and a paper to write down the bad things about this movie," but I was proven completely wrong? and saw some because I could only design the goods. This movie was great. Well, not because it is unwanted and non-commercial cinema like history, but because of the wisdom of the manuscript and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliant, which could have been a silly and meaningless movie if it became given in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Concern Sen Sharma is grace. She is so nicely beautiful that has enjoyed her role perfectly, as if she were born to play this part. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen. But this is not the only performance that is good in the movie, which is Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul who just fires up the screen. (And guess what even the exceptionally highlighted Tara Sharma speaks normally) <br /> <br /> The movie stems from some stupid old parties in the film industry's hush-hush celebrities and you get the idea of ​​what this movie will be about. And for about half an hour through the film, you almost feel the same. But then the movie picks up the pace of a good story and never lets it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement ?? 'It was a good story, Madhvi'. (Thank you). The great thing is that it tackles the question of how stupid these people are in style and does not overdo it and also tackles the social problems and does not make them boring. In the end, it's all a roller coaster and Madhvi tells us we're just smiling at all these people. Just the reason I love watching movies. Ecstatic film making. The play is beautiful, wise and witty.
