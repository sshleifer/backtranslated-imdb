This final Voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. Voyager made it home. In the many years it took to return, Vulcan Tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. He had a disease they were late home to heal. Captain Janeway comes across foreigners who have time travel technology. She realizes that there is a Warp Conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could bring Voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify Voyager. There is a problem. The tube is deep inside Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. He is like a child. He scribbles tho, obsessed, working on mathematical problems or movie reviews or something he is convinced of is important in some way. In the institution Tuvok shouts and asks for 'Janeway' to please, then come back to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to command a federation bus and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of Borg, hoping to get back in time and use this new technology to guide Voyager to Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and connects Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree and argue for the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok and asks him if it is true that he has a brain disease. Tuvok admits it is true, but it cannot be cured by the facilities on the ship, so he has kept it himself. <br /> <br /> The young captain agrees with the older captains' plan. In order to increase their chances of success, the older Janeway plans to distract Borg with its vessels. The Borg actually catch Janeway and her shuttle. The Borg Queen personally includes Captain Janeway. But Janeway has expected this! The Borg Queen has assimilated a virus to herself that kills her. With Borg Queen dead, Voyager passed it back through the Warp Conduit to the federation room.
