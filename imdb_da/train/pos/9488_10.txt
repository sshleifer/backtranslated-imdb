Very memorable, intelligent and exciting film from the true geniuses of one of the French films, the one that Henri Verneuil was able to formally. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK murder and takes place in a non-descriptive, fictitious country. The film, both visually and graphically, is razor sharp. The shot with exact precision follows it after Henry Volnay, the Procuror, who takes himself to dig the coup. In many ways it is a very disturbing movie, not least for the cold and analytical precision of its commentary on the so-called modern state's internal work. The atmosphere and characters are all credible, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his tight planning. On another level, this relatively little-known movie had just a 15-year main start on Oliver Stone, who was praised for the "JFK" movie, a poorer movie in many areas, the smallest of which is not credible ... <br /> < br /> It is a masterpiece, any cinema lover should see it, preferably in its original French version with subs.
