It is so gratifying to see a large piece of art transformed into another without distortion or contrivance. I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book, you would be understandably scared to see some misunderstood interpretation done more for an art film project than actually bringing the deeper meaning of history to the screen. There are a few examples of this with Master and Margarita. As complicated and removed as the story is, the film leaves nothing. It is as if the filmmaker reads Bulgakov's work in the same way as an orchestra leader reads a score - with no note missing. Why can't we find such a talent here in the US? So now my favorite book and movies have the same title.
