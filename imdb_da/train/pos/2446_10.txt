From the start of the show, Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her? The view is not the same as before. Its way worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can't replace anyone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! That is not correct! The niece who replaced her is just, uh! Terrible. She doesn't fit into the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece cannot replace her. She was a great actress. The road better than nieces. Get her back or you will lose a TON of viewers.
