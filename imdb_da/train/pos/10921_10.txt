After reading many good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD, therefore the "spin" money ... I'm a dork). The beginning was all I hoped for, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes I've heard of various Wu-Tang albums) for what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so big, was so predictable. Every time I saw a sign (except the four-legged one) I guessed what the poison he was. Plus, the only cool character is turned off in the middle of the movie. Okay, so the plot wasn't that good, but at least there was some good kung fu right? Wrong. The battles were very short and few and far between. Granted the different styles were all pretty cool, but I wish the fighting was longer. I was hoping to see the Lizard running and doing some crazy ish on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see Centipede do some tight fast ish, but it never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. The battles are all right routines. Don't be fooled just because this movie has a plot, it doesn't mean it's a good one.
