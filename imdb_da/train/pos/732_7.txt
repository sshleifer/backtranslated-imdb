Now I finally got started with Rock 'N' Roll High School ", almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie experience in 1979. (Latecomer, as I am, I will probably see first in the summer's new documentary film" Patti Smith: Dream of Life "sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie doesn't feel dated a bit and yes it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that contains lots of good music and some surprising moments. Riff Randell, adorably played by PJ Soles, and the fight she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High pay for their new repressive principal, Miss Togar, (Danny Peary describes in his book "Cult Movies" precisely Mary Woronov's achievements as a "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teenage anti-establishment teenager is bent here with some absurd humor (the exploding mice, the giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall screens) and some really exciting melodies. d An original punk band The Ramones, and that band separates a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the movie, including five at a concert that is a total blast. In fact, the sight of Riff, who furiously dance to "Teenage Lobotomy" on this blowout may be the funniest moment of the picture. And the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street song "I just want something to do", is quite encouraging. The movie ends with an explosive confrontation that I can imagine every high school kid's wet dream. Fun stuff actually. On a side note, The Ramones was one of the highest bands I have ever seen in concert, so I was very pleased to note that the DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging dots out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder.
