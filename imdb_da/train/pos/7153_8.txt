My wife is a teacher, and she is very familiar with history as he has read it to several of her classes. It never sounded all that interesting to me, and I bought the DVD that could count on it being a movie that wouldn't really be in my alley. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of setup and I thought I was right. It starts a little slow and I have to admit that I was a little sorry - but curious enough to stay with it. Boy, I'm glad I did, because it ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would definitely see it again! <br /> <br /> Casting was very good. Since I haven't read the book, I can't guarantee accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really nice. You liked the characters you should suffer, hated those you were hating, and laughed at those who were having fun. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people might not like this movie. It is sometimes boring, especially at the beginning. All flashbacks can be distracting (even if they are crucial to the story). When the story begins to come together at the end, I think you are repaid in spades for your patience. When all is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
