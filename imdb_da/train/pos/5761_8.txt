I swear, the zombie was killed as twice and held back. I gave this movie a 8. Let's see the people, that's exactly what the other reviewers say, that is, a "handy-cam", shooting movie. Hello, hi, welcome to total indy filmmaking. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to perform in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has holes, yes we see the same zombies over and over, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and shudder scary movie, one to share with your buds or that brutal out the people you really care about LOL. Mellow out people I suppose you all liked tax on waste like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace, and support independent film making !!!
