Can you imagine such a proliferation of talent in a movie without a big budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their prizes: But it would have been perfectly prudent to have seen O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: The clich√© is true here: they do not perform the roles inhabit them. Day-Lewis's performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe-inspiring, but it was truly a sign of the Academy's intelligence that, besides this achievement, they also honored Brenda Fricker's beautifully held, still and heartbreaking work as Christie's mother. By the way, if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in "Swann", it's another movie worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
