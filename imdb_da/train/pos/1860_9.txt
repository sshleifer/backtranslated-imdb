I went to see Antone Fisher without knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's plays were excellent and the story was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual good job of acting as well as leading. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can be helped, and this movie is a perfect example of this. Don't miss this one.
