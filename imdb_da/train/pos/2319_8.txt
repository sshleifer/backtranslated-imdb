<br /> <br /> It's a generic com-of-the-year story - think "The Wedding Member", "Summer of42", "Summer Place", even "Little Women" - and there are moments when Mulligan might has omitted soup music, not used slow motion or played down the golden illuminated prettiness of the setting. Otherwise, it is done with the rare emotional perfect pitch. Nothing is forced, every line has feeling, and pacing is just right. Even the under-A list casting helps: Larger movie stars with more recognizable personalities could have overwhelmed the material. In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14-year-old on the threshold of the woman. Waterston is also very fine, though he needs a lot of movie climbing in and out of the family truck. <br /> <br /> It is noticeable that film makers were aware of their unpromising commercial prospects - not big stars, no big car accidents, no special effects - and deliberately decided to make the best movie, the cashier's office is damned. It is intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs. If you discover yourself at the end, you don't have to feel that you've been pushed.
