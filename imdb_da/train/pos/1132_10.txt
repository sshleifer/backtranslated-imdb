Its Hollywood mimics Daytiem Soap Operas at its best! It's the fun we never see. Big figures and great lines. Whoopi is fun ..... Sally Field is so over the top .... Gary Marshall's lines are a rebellion .... that's what I love about good comedies. Never afraid to poke fun on him !!!!!! The sets were great .... wardrobe was on point and backstabbing "Montana Morehead" was a devilish delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but still beautiful and fun when on the screen. I would love to know how the idea for this movie came up. Never have I seen a cast of people having fun doing comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for DVD !!!
