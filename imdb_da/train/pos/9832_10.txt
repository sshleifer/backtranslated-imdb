Wow this was a great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie by two great instructors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD") Lucio started this movie and was sick so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected to show up, so if you have seen "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie, and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and liked boats or a theme, then it is a movie , you have to see it has a great "ZOMBIE" make-up witch that looks great "ZOMBIES" has a fun "ZOMBIE" flying head! And "ZOMBIE" birds spitting on you and making you a "ZOMBIE" people, but they are primarily just the big poisonous "ZOMBIES" as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian "ZOMBIE" movies or just "ZOMBIE" movies in general, check out this Italian "ZOMBIE" movie!
