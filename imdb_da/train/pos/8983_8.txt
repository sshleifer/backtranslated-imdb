The shot in the car from the windscreen, someone plays another their latest song, another did not respond, according to voice-over. I just wonder how that was going to happen. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered how came a camera was there. If the scenes shot where Warhols fell on a BJM post-party are true, then it was untapped to the maximum, if not, then it was a total fabrication, neither did it make me uncomfortable if that were the purpose? Throughout this movie I kept wondering how the footage came. Taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all think we are.
