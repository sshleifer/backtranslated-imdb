I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It's hard to believe this, Mrs Bloom's direct debut, it's beautifully paced and done. Large cast characters could be out of an Anne Tyler novel, ie. They are tiered with back story and potential futures, there are no fake notes, surprisingly humorous shadows among self-contained anxiety and very real, if not earthquake, dilemmas. If you saw "The Best of Youth", you will recognize how well drawn the figure is through small moments, even though history is moving fast. I really hope it will be distributed in the United States. I live in a rather sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
