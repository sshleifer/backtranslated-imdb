"The Mother" is the extraordinary piece of film making - it makes you think, it does not pull - and ultimately it gives you thoughts. Very open with respect to the fate of the protagonist. Anne Reid (who I only knew cards from her appearance in some Victoria Wood-led projects and thought a fine comedienne) is truly amazing here. Not the stereotypical widow who was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that outdoor and adventurous at first. She plays her character just with the right note that rings true (it did it for me). Heavy cast. Great script. Renaissance of European cinema actually;)
