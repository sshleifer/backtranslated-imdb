This is one of the more adorable episodes in the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogues and fun characters to break the thrill of some creepy moments. There is the usual blonde vamp "dancer" (what's with Serling's love for that kind of character, so she stops showing up in various episodes?) And other different characters, but it's Jack Elam's "old man" who steals the show completely. I consider this the fun, light-hearted version of "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" - or perhaps a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of "The Thing". On another note: I thought that the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went to other things - he then knew - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two TV credits to his name.
