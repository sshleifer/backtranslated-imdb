These days, Spielberg's "The Purple Purple" is mostly remembered to be nominated for eleven Oscars and win zilch. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for best director. Possibly the filmmakers tell more recognition than they were given. The story relates to Celie Johnson's (Whoopi Goldberg) trials and tribulations, an African American woman who first dominated by her incestuous father and then by her fierce husband. The film spans several years and focuses primarily on Celie's relationship with the women around her. It is told by a certain female perspective, but you do not fear that it is a saccharin 'chick flick'. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting one that lived with humor at times, even though the central character is martial arts. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the end of the movie, but I didn't mind, although similar content in a smaller movie would probably make me roll my eyes. The film received three Oscar nominations to perform: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey probably deserved, and Danny Glover was incredibly stiff. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission speaks belief as Spielberg's direction here is first-class. I'm not very fond of Quincy Jones score, but it's not below average in any way. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, history is a satisfying, well-informed masterpiece maker from Pulitzer Award winning material. Try it and you will be as confused as I am about how it could be so poorly treated at Oscar Night.
