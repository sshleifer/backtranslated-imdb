Watched this night and was overwhelmed by the in-depth story line, the outstanding character development and the good karmic vibe derived from plays and movies as a whole. Without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with a regular Joe commuting to her office job every day, inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the main character and the different characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor, learn about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> History has a prologue about what dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so learning to dance in Japan is not as easy as it is here in the United States <br /> <br /> The movie is lystl√∏s; You will laugh aloud on some of the sight gags. But it is also worthy in a way that is difficult to describe. All the characters of the movie are taken seriously as they are, and no one is diminished because of their "imperfections". I've been thinking of taking social dance courses with some friends. It just happened, a friend lent me the video about learning to dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so, because now I'm really nerdy to try. <br /> <br /> See this wonderful family movie (small children may not get it, but teens would definitely) and smile at the true care you see in it again and again. <br /> <br /> Why they would remake that we dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as it is.
