Edmund Burke said "all evil needs are too good that I do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage because not enough families go to watch quality movies. This film was uplifting the story of the loss and restoration of faith. It had no violence, no evil, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western landscape was filmed well, and some of the prospects were simply breathtaking. Actors were a little young for their parts, but otherwise credible and talented. Music scores were too high and in some places the dialog drowned completely. I'm rarely surprised by movie endings more, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Sometimes the good men win and they win with honest effort. We liked the movie and the message and would recommend it to the whole family.
