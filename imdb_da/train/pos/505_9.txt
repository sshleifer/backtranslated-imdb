A very good start. I was a little surprised to find the machines not quite as advanced: It should have been cruder as we saw in the original series. Cast is interesting, although the Volcano lady comes across as a little too human. She needs schooling at Spock, which is the model for this race. Too bad they could not have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Ms Park, the Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has options. Didn't sort the other men except the black guy. He is a really sympathetic one. Bakula must find his niche - In QL, his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try something. He is of course great and strong enough for the heroines. The tongues were ok, though I didn't like their make-up.
