"Der Todesking" -Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film (the first was infamous "Nekromantik") has no central character or characters, but instead thematic continuity in the suicide act. Divided into weekdays, it consists of a series of set pieces, each containing self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, the production values ​​are low, and it is disturbing, but in many ways "There Todsking" is extremely effective. It makes you think, which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike the other Buttgereits works, it is not that fun, but there are some unpleasant images like the castration scene in the Tuesday episode, a devastating corpse and various acts of suicide. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressing and full of pain! - Just great if you want my opinion.10 out of 10 - Check out this postmodern shock! Disturbing art in the purest form!
