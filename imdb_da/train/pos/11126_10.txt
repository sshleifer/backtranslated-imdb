The soprano is undoubtedly the biggest show in dramatic television history. It's hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first class performances. <br /> <br /> Across its epic scale it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant high quality level. Centering around the life of a Tony Sopran, a man living in two families. One is the conventional wife and two children, nuclear family, the other is a large New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the head of both. The game of James Gandolfini, True Romance and The Mexican Fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also sympathetic guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini to make a female and horrible aggressive brute a truly identifiable and perfectly leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony. <br/> <br /> The cast of hundreds never has a flat performance, and like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto stand out, your memory will last forever. <br /> <br /> However, the true genius of this story is the creator and author's courage and revolutionary in a conventional drama series. Twenty-minute dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Nevertheless, this style is fulfilled by really touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series is never cold-hearted or free. <br /> <br /> With TV now competitive and often poor. The soprano stands high above the rest as America's most original and convincing drama. Forget family edited. This is TV edited.
