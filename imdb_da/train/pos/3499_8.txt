Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you should definitely watch. It was very heart-felt and had a lot of humor that made you suck straight in. It's as much as real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, a nice teenager, but with a good heart at the end, loves love at all the right places that deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after handling an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use actually actually uses him. I recommend people to watch this movie because it looks like you are seeing a real family. That's how much the feeling of this movie has. A heart-filled moment was when Victor's grandmother throws victory over something simple. Victor was really heart and couldn't believe she would do something like that. It made me feel really sorry for him as if it were right. Overall I give this movie a B +
