Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the movie. The movie's cast all really well. Robert Wagner played his role well. Relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was a lovely. There may be a big age difference there, but they are a unique couple. The two actors worked really well together. The music in the movie is really good by Ron Ramin and fits well with the girl. There are a lot of things happening in the movie that you don't know what's going on and what will happen next, and this movie keeps you going from the beginning to the end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner then watch this great movie!
