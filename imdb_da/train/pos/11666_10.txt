THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite movie I've seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although it is stylish very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (Kawaslep opening 2D sequence of) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a color color that is a feast for the senses. KELLS is so sumptuous - almost gothic in its layout (reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat overall perspective, ornate in its Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simplistic and appealing - and it all works together beautifully. You will fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are then drawn to every detail of the story and to every kind of pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget / very small crew film, is amazing. The reason for support among our animation communities is phenomenal. This movie is breathtaking and buzz among our colleagues in recommending this movie spread like a fire. Congratulations to KELLS on its many awards, its Annie nomination as well as its current Oscar-qualified races. They are all very well-deserved nods, actually ...
