Modern viewers know this little movie primarily as a model for remake, "The Money Pit". Older viewers see it today with the wisps of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a lighter, less complicated era. Or was it? Of course, time has a way of changing prospects, and with so many movies today truly ulcerating with social and political comments, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings builds his dream home", there can therefore be more than the audience looking for in 1948. There are political comments, though subtle. Finding a house in the late 40's was a really disturbing experience, only slightly softened by the upcoming Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The adolescents always seem to talk about progressive ideas being taught in school (which would actually get teachers accused of communism). In fact, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a democratic fire: he was married to Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of softening Communism (and who destroyed her). Jason Robards, Sr., has a small role in the movie, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr., would for many years be a very active liberal democrat. Almost the odd colleague was Cary Grant, whose strong conservatism reflected numerous political sentiments in Hollywood already slipping. But it was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat, and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be a decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream movies, and then not so subtly.
