Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I saw together "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we liked it, but we did not love it as we loved "A special day". I think Ettore Scola is pretty undervalued: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest movie was disappointing. And then, last night my mother and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, filmography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but what I liked most was chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and play the leading role of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatic fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants another child to get a prize for the big families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend a special day together, the special day of 1938, when Hitler came to Rome, where he visited Mussolini. I don't want to spoil the plot: look for this movie!
