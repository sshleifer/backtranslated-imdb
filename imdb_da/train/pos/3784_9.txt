Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the most underrated movies I've seen for a long time and is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, also Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this movie: First, you see stupid dialogue, far-fetched plot, young idea. OR .. You see excellently dimmed idiots who once again find themselves in a situation that is too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it will be a great movie. Bill and Ted go into the story with the same sincerity, only Bill and Ted. This is a difficult fence to balance on, but when you see the movie not as a throwaway scrub comedy, but as a two-guy adventure that has nothing to be in an adventure, it gets so much more.
