This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50s, when the Communists are trying to steal crimes of arms from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. He gives a pretty decent performance, but there is no A-list about him. Interestingly, he was not only an anti-hero, but through most of the film, an unbelievable anti-hero. It's not very normal. Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. The great character actress Thelma Ritter shines like the stool pigeon. The plot had its fair share of twists, wisecracks and hard talk. There is a battle scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) which was pretty gritty and exciting. I think no fans (like myself) will enjoy this movie. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit dated, and the entire Commie case is a bit exaggerated.
