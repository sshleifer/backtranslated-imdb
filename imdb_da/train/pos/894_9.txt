This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "Condors", but he's no less sure of being an instructor or actor. In fact, he is at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal action that boasts half a dozen fantastic sequences and also manages to share a compassionate, loving love story as well. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious additions to the action and ensure that viewers do not hit the forward button between the physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a fun light saber duel, puts a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence where Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comical tone. The fast and furious rod fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, excellent direction and is easily one of the best ever. The violence of the film slowly escalates, until finally when the climatic rally comes, we are exposed to some of the most brutal changes ever seen in a sammo production. The director / actor's attack on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, threatening opponents is a knee-jerk, physical punishment. <br /> <br /> Fantastic at all levels and one of the best martial arts films ever made. <br /> <br /> Great score too.
