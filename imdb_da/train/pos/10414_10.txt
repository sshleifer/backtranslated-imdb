I first discovered Alexander Kordas (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s about a reissue billed as "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown to never be forgotten programs. The music at Miklos Rozsa improved both films. The technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has been on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years went by, it became more difficult to enjoy the color of the film as it had originally been presented. True Technicolor provided room for an Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and dampened the original Technicolor's vibration. The laser disc release of this title also has the pastel looked at it - well, but not as it should be. NOW comes the problem M-G-M DVD (Dec 3, 2002). THE THIEF OF BODDAD has again the wonderful Technicolor look at it on a DVD that is NOT STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see it again, that after watching the DVD once I saw it again. The only "Extras" is a Spanish dubbed version, subtitles in both English and Spanish, and a beautifully finished original theater trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (as a substitute for bad public domain prints in circulation) soon follow DVD.
