Kay Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a really good man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He has written a bunch of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and this film is that your thoughts are actually what causes your problems and that the cause of your anger is almost never due to what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy but almost never do it. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, remember very openly and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to get through life), like most of the parts in this movie, if you listen and watch. See it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you learn to live and make the most of it ... <br /> <br /> So while you look, remember: <br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work unless it's open!"
