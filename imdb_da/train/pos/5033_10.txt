This is one of the movies that after watching it, you will continue to think and come back even months after viewing. The action is spectacular for starring two kids (I usually hate movies with whiny kid acting). Bill Paxton is amazing, his direct debut is even better than what I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Play over, man! Play over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part about the movie is dichotomy between the scenes where the actors play a family and when they do their "work". It really makes the movie credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'm waiting for more movies, I'm sure to love!
