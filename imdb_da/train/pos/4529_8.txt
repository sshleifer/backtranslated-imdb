As is well known by long-haired young people who are incredibly interested in the silent rant of this Herr Graf, aristocrats would like to travel to exclusive and prominent places to avoid the heat, as hordes of coarse people take their ease. Such bizarre travels around the world also occur in "Three Ages", a charming and elegant piece of silence directed by ancient hands, namely Mr Buster Keaton and Mr. Eddie Cline. Of course, this German counter seemed the most The first segment focused on the Stone Age because of the affinity that this aristocrat feels about the ancient times. prefer it to the second segment that takes place during Rome's glory (it should have included the cause of the Roman Empire's decline, that is, barbarians or the same Germans). Of course, the third segment finds itself in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern. The quest motif that moves Mr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure the weird and hilarious happenings of three different ages is the search for love, a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self-interest. Every time "Three Years" appears in the Schloss theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty quiet movie (even for a serious German counter), an oeuvre filled with gags and gadgets, puns, chat and acrobatics, visuals and amazing technical tricks, an absolutely silent delicacy that is perfect for allowing one to endure the various and rough summer times. <br /> <br /> Now, if you allow me, I must temporarily take my vacation because this German Count must flirt with an old teutonic heir who doesn't see her age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
