Not a bad martial arts movie. Fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job with his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to the story that works. It would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and has strong female walks. It was definitely worth seeing. I recommend the movie to all drama and martial arts lovers.
