I watched this movie in the avant premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from that moment on I was expecting to see the final result. I have not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3d movie with a high contrast black and white render. Clearly inspired by some comics, such as those from F. Miller. In this optics, it goes a step further than the excellent "Sin City" adaptation by R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) no gray or an intermediate color, but a graphic style that you have never seen before in a realistic animated movie. (Can't wait for the scanner to dark) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters, and we soon forget the technical aspect of concentrating on more classic elements such as direction or plot. The direction remains sober and controlled, despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and this is a great surprise. The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintains the viewer interested until the end. Despite a classic bass plot (a survey that goes far beyond the original expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of some companies ...) give this film a great interest. <br /> <br /> Despite it being an animated movie, this is obviously not made for children. You find here no funny animal or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. It is far closer to a good movie noir. I found out that the setting is one of the best aspects of the movie: we still feel the familiar Paris, but it's morphed with a good touch of futurism. Nevertheless, I regret some errors. The assembly is sometimes a little flat, one or two very clich√© slow motion effects and some bad dialogues. Although the technical is excellent, it shows its boundaries in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy" did). These little things make it a 7/10. It is a successful artistic challenge that you should see if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckily they didn't ask John Woo to do the job!). In conclusion, it is a film with blasting images, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. See it if you can! <br /> <br /> Excuse me for spelling mistakes.
