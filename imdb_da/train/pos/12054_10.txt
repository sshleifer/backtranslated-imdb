I first saw this movie here in the United States in December 1989, when Central TV broadcast it. I still have the video tape, though it is worn out (over the years, many friends and family members have borrowed it and also been chilled!). <br /> <br /> Still, I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas shopping, changing the lights and watching what was announced as a 'Christmas Ghost Story'. Even now I remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on the neck that are at the end ... I have seen some comments on the film that say it is not this and not ... I think these people are scared Friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rattles, which are ridiculous. This is a "traditional" ghost story; There are no big budget acts or special effects ... no gang, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chainsaws or weapons etc. So so refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like chilling horror, well-written, well-acted and with a really scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; Only last night I saw the original Haunting, and it's a great movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the film is different from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you * will * like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, lock the doors, grab a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
