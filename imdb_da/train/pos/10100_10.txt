I stumbled upon this (Act-I) with pure silly luck and it was more than a decade ago. This was not even what the cover of the tape mentioned. That surprised me. It scared me. It shocked me. I eventually forgot, and almost a decade later I was thinking about it again. Then both actions went and bought. They were even better than I had experienced in the first place. My only complaint is that while the thought police are continuing and continuing to be at war with crime, guaranteeing thought and heavy artillery, they seem to be really having trouble with criminals. It is either never shown or is simply a lie, as they seem to take it easy of most of the time. If it was a little about being in a state of war, was really propaganda, it certainly hasn't been shown as such. <br /> <br /> I don't think the original Japanese version could have been as good as the American version of this. But as far as history is concerned, there have certainly been some suitable explanations lost in translation, but it can be excused.
