*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems very exaggerated until I remember that my college campus had a former student-turned Nazi racist-killer-as-then-committed suicide too : His name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> see him on wikipedia- I added a few pictures to their article about him. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
