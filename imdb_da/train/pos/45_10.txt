Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wonder what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched that movie six times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I don't usually cry over movies, but one one made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like the one. All in all, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you become part of it. The final end is the part that really got me when she cried when she got her diploma because it had the daughter's name on it. My heart felt like it was shattered then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't got her yet. I loved it so much.
