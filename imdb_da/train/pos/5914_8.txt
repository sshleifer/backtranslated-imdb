MPAA: Rated R for violence, language, nudity and short drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more of Bashki's movies. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. It was considered racist, and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, he even led protests outside the theater, where the film was the feature film. The film was only released on VHS under the title "Street Fight". It is now considered a cult-classical movie and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group Wu-Tang Clan are said to have enjoyed this movie. I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but it is also very fun. Totally aware of Bashki or Blaxploitation movie fans. The film mixes live action and animation kind of like the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would have preferred it in full animation, but wh in any case. The movie starts with a ruler and another man runs to save two of their friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the elder tells a story of three men he kneels. The film then changes to animation format, we see three black men selling their house to this man. They decide to name themselves in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem, and he's pretty much a big shot. The film goes on as the Italian mafia wants him out. The Mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are gay and an Italian clown. Coonskin is an entertaining animated movie worth checking out if you can find it.
