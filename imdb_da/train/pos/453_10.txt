I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie without cussing, no sex and no violence. You can think of it as "the ultimate chick flick", but I bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who also love it. Do not, however, invite the children. This movie is very low-key. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and the beautiful landscape, along with the gentle manners of the ladies, recall the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelit painting. <br /> <br /> Let someone think that your really only sees a kind of movie, I want to rewrite a line I once heard about "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
