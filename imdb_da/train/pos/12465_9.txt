I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very poignant reading (saying not calculated). It is not too difficult to read for those out there who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture the passions in relationships more than the film, and the film becomes more sensible after reading the book. After growing up in Melbourne, I could really relate to this book and film. Very few Australian female writers were around the 70s, and therefore very little is documented about the lifestyle of a woman in a city in Australia in this era or class. It is a valuable piece of Melbourne history. It's a shame that it's documented as a kind of 80-soft porn movie. It is far from it, and as the other reviewer has mentioned, please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what the movie is about. Those who rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was made in 1982, so don't expect Hollywood over dramatization as they seem to incorporate these days. This is what I like about it. It's also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just great as Nora, and it's great to see her right, because if you're close to my age, you'll best remember her for her stints at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
