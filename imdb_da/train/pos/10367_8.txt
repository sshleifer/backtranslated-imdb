When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. When I saw it another time in an Australian cinema class, I realized another point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo spoke Lindy Chamberlin's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were carefree, but didn't show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and therefore they could not provide it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of grief, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it herself. The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and it became people against Lindy. Although it was a pure accident, it still happened. It can be one of the biggest disasters due to the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlook political views. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there) and Sam Neill is just as great. You will probably be blown away just by what you see here. Absolutely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever.
