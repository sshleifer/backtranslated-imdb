This series premieres on the cable TV station "Comedy Central" in the United States. It was cut to death and shown out of order. This was sad for the audience it should have attracted, it didn't and fell off the road. Fortunately, my cable company went digital at the same time and I got the BBC. Thank goodness because I got to see "The Gentleman League" in order, complete and incomplete. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" troupe is right up there with England's "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "The Kids in the Hall". But .. a warning. <br /> <br /> "The Gentleman League" is a step further. It is not just about dressing in succession and lighting the cultural diseases, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. I can tell many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people, it will fear others. But remember, the only comedy .. dark comedy. If it's not your thing, don't look. If you think you know dark comedy, see it here - if you get angry and sad, you don't quite know DARK KOMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys got it right and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every single character creation. There is a complete story told here from episode 1 to the end. You can't see one episode at a time, willingly nilly, it's one of the charms of this series. Look it all right. See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. No one and nothing is out of bounds. That, ladies, is "dark humor". Bravo!
