When I was born, this TV series was the number one show on T.V. !! America designated the ultimate fat country with great ambitions, unlimited potential and a very comfortable economy !! After a great Sunday dinner, why not sit back and watch "Bonanza", IN COLOR !!! This domestic western evokes an American tradition that accompanies the typical American household's complacency in the era it was seen. The breathtaking Lake Tahoe movie symbolized an infinite prosperity in the growing American culture !! Western Movies were so popular that Western TV shows came along! This was a period of time in our country that longed for a brief reflection on our own country's struggle for survival !! The end result of the trials and tribulations of the Ponderosa Ranch, as evidenced by this series, was a realization that Americans are now pleasingly enjoying the fruits of Cartwright's meticulous work !! <br /> <br /> The TV show "Bonanza" was popular for so many different reasons, mostly due to the fact that late fifties and early sixties had not yet built the split of two different cultural thinking who was ready to surface with our nation! The union of ideologies in the United States, which ruled in the debut of "Bonanza", was a great reason for the success of the show !! In the show's later years, "Bonanza" had established a strongly rooted core TV audience! The cast of "Bonanza" became famous, and the healthy entertainment of "Bonanza" included a companionship for the American idealist !! Everyone liked "Bonanza" and many Americans loved it completely !! Reflecting on rough and tumble family values ​​is a favorite time for many Americans, and the TV show "Bonanza" was perfect for this thinking !! I liked the show a lot and most people I know too! Definitely loved my whole family "Bonanza" !! This show was one of the early American classics in television history !!
