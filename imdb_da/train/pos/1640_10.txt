"Heartland" is a wonderful portrayal of what it really was to live on the border. The hard work and the individual strength needed to survive the difficulties of the climate and the lack of medical care are mixed with the comradeship and interdependence of the settlers. The drama was particularly meaningful because history is based on real-time diaries whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or looked like they had just used a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just amazing. She is an example of the strong, persistent people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and do not make any hardship in the way of a new life in a new country.
