UC 0079 is the one-year war almost to the end. A neutral colony of Page 6 has been targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. Their goal is that a new Gundam is built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, meets a Zaku after a fight in the colony, he is friendly with beginner MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a grandfather to Al (whose true father always works) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they must meet .... in battle. Always learn that war is not children's play, and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well done show. The mobile carriers are extremely well designed, and the animation can look dated, but really shows emotions in the characters. If you liked 0083, check this out or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look at a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on the then mobile suit battle. I would rate it more of a drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
