Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good play. Good management. Good art direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. Well everything. Put it all together and you end up with great entertainment. Shame is that there are hardly enough films of this caliber that are being made these days. We can count ourselves lucky that writers / instructors like John Hughes can sometimes get their creative voices heard. <br /> <br /> When I notice that I see a movie for the third or fourth time and still find it satisfactorily, I have to conclude that something about that movie is right.
