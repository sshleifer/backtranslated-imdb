The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnite mystery. There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick: great choreography, horrible dubbing, various "styles" of fighting and a wide variety of highly exaggerated, often cheesey human feelings. But the plot is definitely better than average. It's interesting and keeps you aware of all the battles without a fight. Occasionally, it is even capable of shooting up to the audience, which when X-character receives terrible injustice. Another thing I love about the five deadly venom is the beautiful simplicity of the film's morals and themes. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. The cowardly, greedy and corrupt loses. The bad boys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own betrayal and restraint. The good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome the odds and get out on top. <br /> <br /> Poison Clan Rocks!
