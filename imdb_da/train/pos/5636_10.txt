In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small Texas town, sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local competition and joins a prestigious Philadelphia High School. Then the film grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was filled with great songs and plays and characters that kept it moving at a very good pace. The action was of course wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were excellent as well as Nick Roth. The camera work was really good and I was very pleased with the end (it seems that a sequel may be up and running). Kudos to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. Quite a gem in the file archives.
