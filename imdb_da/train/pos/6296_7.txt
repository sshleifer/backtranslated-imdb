Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is a hopeful writer who is still seeking his great break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone advisor for a mental hotline in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his residential building is burning down. Parker and his cat make it alive, but are now stuck with the hard task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. Words come to Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay man. When Parker is straight, but the price is right, he decides to pretend he's gay. Samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as his new partner. But poor parks. Sam is lovely, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Besides, Sam doesn't have a successful businessman's boyfriend anyway? This is a cute, sweet and humorous movie featuring two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a string of "how can I stop these ruse" scenes, with Sam asking Parker for shampoo while she shower or wont with him to keep her in bed when she receives bad news. It is also necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" gay friend, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing him with a man she knows. Hopefully, homosexuals will not find this for offensive as this viewer believed that most problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small movie, costumes, sets and camera work were also pretty good. Therefore, if you love these fun stories of love, get it here soon. You like what you see, I know.
