We saw this in my Women's Health Issues class to point out how women are treated subordinate to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to see. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a fan of different cultures, and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its assessment. This is a movie I want to show to my kids. The professor in our class meant that the film was primarily one to educate on women, but this film was more than that. It is one of those films that will forever be in my mind and will be a favorite.
