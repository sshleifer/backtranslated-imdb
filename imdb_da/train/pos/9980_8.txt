Any movie showing federal pigs (people in the government) to be the powerful threats they are in reality has much to recommend it to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, script monitoring and editing and even, sometimes, the management is lacking, so there will be people who want to break down the whole movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, detest it. Thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk. <br /> <br /> Now I can't remember why. <br /> <br /> I think the two should not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different films. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different films. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" provides a gathering place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism that believes in human rights that recognize the threat to freedom, the government can and is, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The voice" carries a cloak that bears the state's motto in New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." At one point it would have been the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie to cheer.
