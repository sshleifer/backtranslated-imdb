I would not go as far as not recommending this movie, as the only issues I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the kind of things common to any children's movie that has ever done the. It doesn't make it bad, just not something I would go a long way. It's a little saccharin, so I can say that for the most part someone looking for something with a little more white could be disappointed in a course for-kids movie like this one. <br /> <br /> But all this goes out of the window when the squirrel (one in all trailers) comes on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys, hello, can you hold on to some more squirrels? Every time it becomes unbearably boring. It doesn't save the movie, but you can leave to say 'at least there was one aspect where I couldn't stop laughing.' <br /> <br /> And of course it won't visually disappoint, but it's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all their things I will put this at the bottom ... but it is not in itself bad.
