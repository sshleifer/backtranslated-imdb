My father was the prison administrator (he is retired now) shown in this documentary, and I grew up around prison life, so maybe my views will be quite different from everyone else who sees this movie. I would say that the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are great artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) show and tell this story, B) get into these inmates and hearts, and C) make all this responsible. Responsible for their art and, more importantly, responsible to the prisons and staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be praised without end for this work. Taking 170 hours, yes hours, with recordings and being able to cut and lubricate it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my greatest respect. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in circumstances that only a very, very few, were able to see. I was at the insertion screening. I was in the same room with these men as they saw their hearts on the screen. I saw men crying on TV and crying in the chair in front of me, and let me tell you it was a very deep experience. These men have committed terrible crimes in some cases, but have found ways to try to redeem themselves, even though they see themselves as infinite. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could do what they did in such a harsh environment? Watching them react to the movie was an experience I am forever grateful for, and I will never forget that. I thank the men who allowed me this glimpse of their lives, I thank my father for making all this possible and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour their blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the prisoners contained in it. 'Oz' is not true, TV is not right. 'Shakespeare behind bars' are.
