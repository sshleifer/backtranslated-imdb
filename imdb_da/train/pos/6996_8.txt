This movie was a really good flip over something that affects us all. I know I have personally entered this many times. Kindness Will Smith has sprung on the societal question of texting while driving. People don't. An hour and forty and five minutes is not enough time for this reason. Personally, I wanted to throw my cellphone after the movie. I was happy to see other people in the theater watching the message and dumping their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you worry about your family, get them to see this important public message about text messages while driving, or they could kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
