This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month, they showed a Yugoslav movie every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name I can't remember. If you know, let me know! Anyway, how can I watch this movie again ???? A DVD of this movie where ?? Tell me at vandoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (involving a train, rather than a bus), the name I can't remember. If you know, let me know!
