Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors the country has ever had, showed that he was at home with movies. With "Panic in the Streets", Mr Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his masterpiece "On the Waterfront", although both films only share the water setting, because they are different visions of different subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot on the spot in New Orleans. The adaptation of Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories, which is the basis of the film, is remarkable because it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when they visited "The Big Easy". One of the great assets of this movie is the magnificent black and white filmography of Joseph MacDonald, showing New Orleans at best. Also the music, Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the case a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been shot in New York or another northern city because it presents us with characters that speak more like "broklynse" than maybe a southern accent that one might hear in that part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the movie Jack Palance, making his screen debut, crumbling the screen every time you see him. He was so intense! At the same time, this hard guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his ill partner, who is unknown to him, suffering a fatal disease. Blackie, comforts this man, caresses his sweaty face and runs his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with forgiveness. It was also noteworthy that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seems to have made their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it real. <br /> <br /> The film also presents a normal page with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the movie. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife discuss how they seem to be unable to make ends meet with their pay, something that many families have to deal with every day. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more listed and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds like she is a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie.
