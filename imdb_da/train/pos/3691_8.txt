The whole doesn't even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This movie features a number of some of the most diversified creative instructors of our time and some well-known names in the cast. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity resembles that. In fact, given that the approach to the theme of all these different directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can feel that we are still watching the same movie. There has not been much effort to make it a whole. This buffet has so many good ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in a single bowl.
