An exciting adventure chairman, George Stevens (before turning to more serious fare like 1948, I remember MAMA and 1956's GIANT), set the standard for all future action yarns to follow. Loosely based on the Rudyard Kipling poem by the same, GUNGA DIN follows the journey from three military officers in 19th century India. The noble trio must brave a series of battles and other dangers, including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. Their screen experiences remain exciting even after more than six decades and have inspired almost everything from Cliffhanger-inspired space opera STAR WARS (1977) to the corresponding plotted RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <br /> The biggest cause of the image's success, however, is the pitch performance of the movie's trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen has rarely been better than the straining hard guy, Cary Grant is the ultimate comic book, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is just as great as a possible hero - maybe even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and such warm and credible comrades are exactly what is lacking in most modern action images - and they receive tremendous support from the amazing Sam Jaffe who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title a character lighthouse of human sweetness and quiet strength. A big hit in its time (the film was supposedly the second largest money maker from 1939 behind the eerily successful GONE WITH THE WIND), and that's probably the best movie of its kind.
