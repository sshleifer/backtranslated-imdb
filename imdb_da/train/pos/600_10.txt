Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who runs a thousand miles to visit his absent millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) on a sparkling windmill-driven ranch and end up in the dangerous path of his young, twilight and seductive founder from hell (the yummy Clare Wren), causing problems for the already dysfunctional family. An exciting, stylish and exciting drama that didn't receive any advertising and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted and tightly aimed at a script that keeps you biting your nails. I can't believe the reviewers who didn't like it ever saw it. It's an undiscovered classic.
