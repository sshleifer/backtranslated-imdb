Have not seen any of the Japanese Grudge movies, but I really enjoy this. I rarely get SCARED when watching movies. I can jump if the effect and sound are spectacular enough, but being afraid of a movie is a rare thing for me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything when I saw it. I didn't expect to be scared. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you seem to love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge movies, but even though I haven't seen them, I don't really think comparing a movie. This film is on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist and made so targeted. The storytelling techniques used - the broken time frame for example - are perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he is doing and I think he got his vision through as he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. It's a movie you want to enjoy watching or hating. It's as simple as that.
