My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school, which is also engaged in other disabled children. I have been rubbish of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled and I still believe in this day that no one is or will ever confuse her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could speak, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. My sister can go, but she can't pronounce a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but address things. but this movie made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I have SEA SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underestimated, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you are not attractive? This guy was knocked down by many girls because of his condition. Not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even get up. <br /> <br /> My point: Parents of toddlers, I suggest your children see this movie with you, so next time they see someone in the street in a wheelchair, they do not stare at them as if they are foreigners. My sister got millions of gazes, and it breaks my heart to believe it still happens to many people. This movie will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also humans. 10.10
