I saw "Ice Age" in the cinema and I liked the movie. Despite the fact that the Ice Age has many flaws and scientific flaws such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the location of where the story passes (seeing North America but has some features from Iceland for example) We have fun ourselves. (unless you are very serious!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters an ICE AGE, and many animals are migrants to the south, where are warmer. Sid is a stupid sloth left by his own family who can no longer stand him. He meets Manfred, or he calls '' Manny '' a moody mammoth who doesn't care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Concerned that he could easily be caught, Sid decided to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey they found a human mother with his baby. The mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and return the child to humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them go to a shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego is from a saber clan who hates people and wants to kill the child, and also pretend to betray both of them to make them become the saber's food. What will happen will depend on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
