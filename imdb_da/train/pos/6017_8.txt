There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational point of view or try to describe it using words and conventions you want to use for other movies. This is because it is not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have somehow been transformed into an object as usual as a movie. What we see is not the unfolding of a plot, but rather a series of events that we do not see in movies every day, but only imagine ourselves as the background that we ourselves will deliver when we hear about some tragic news in the news about or from friends. We we see is our imagination of people who are abstracts for us - no one we know, but we have undoubtedly heard of them in a book or on television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, running and inevitably escaping. Only the escape is from something immaterial - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of civilization is allowed to exist, even though laziness or ... human nature. Seen in the late 1960s Los Angeles, our players act against and respond to the self-inflicted misery of modern life. These creatures are effectively empty slates that can show every move we can imagine if we want it. Although the actions taken can be seen as criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not even criminals. They are people who seek to return to a well-known, non-produced existence beyond the normal they experience every day. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they achieve some form of self-realization as they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern life. They only achieve true life in the natural world, even though it is the next victim of modern existence. At the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a fame of humanitarian affiliation with the natural world. As even the most broken pieces of the earth leave our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the way to the death of the human spirit.
