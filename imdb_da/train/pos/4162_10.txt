Yes it is. In fact, it's a place in my top 20 all-time favorite movies. Number 15, I think. Anyways, I'm usually not one for plots, but I think plots work better in anime and RPG video games, (Final Fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. But this one has it all. Live drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well-written manuscript. While this is not right for children, they can still see it contains no graphic blood, gut and silicone. But I don't think they will understand it.
