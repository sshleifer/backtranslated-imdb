I saw this picture in 1940 for $ .11, and I would like to secure a DVD in 2006 The movie was the greatest adventure of the time and, like all epics, it is still an entertainment wonder (B&W and all) You get a feeling of true tied friendship in chemistry between the actors and the performance of Sam Jaffe & Eduardo Cianelli is excellent. (It couldn't be done today I especially liked the end, when the Colonel recites the end of Kipling's poem about Swing Your Play and tells "Untouchable" "You are a better man than I am Swing Your" They don't make movies of this character Today, the only cast member still living today is Joan Fontaine
