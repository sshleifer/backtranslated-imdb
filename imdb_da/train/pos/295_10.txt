Bogdonovich's (mostly) unheralded classic is a movie unlike almost any other. A movie that has the feeling of an adventure but has a solid grounding in fact because of its use of authentic Manhattan places and "true" geography, perhaps the best location movie in NYC I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant and the whole ensemble is a group you want to really exist so you could spend time with them. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that does not appear to be a ripening of anything else is this highlight of Bogdanovich's fertile after-success career when his best work really was done ("saint jack" "Ultimately ...", "sounds off".
