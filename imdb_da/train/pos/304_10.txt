I saw it a few years ago. I remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mix of melancholy things, like Dorothy's fate and Bogdanovit's personal future. <br /> <br /> I turn to look at my VHS copy and then I went through it more and more. Today, I'm waiting for the DVD version, at all costs, thank you! <br /> <br /> The country and the easy listening music are very well chosen from the very first second, a little bluish but also happy. /> <br /> All the characters are good for me, with fun situations, great plays and many dialogues that have made this a cult movie for me and many people I met on the internet or in movie clubs. This may not be a case. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope of life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this may be a special comment on the movie, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think the movie marked me and I will never forget it.
