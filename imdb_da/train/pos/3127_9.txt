I loved this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness as the original series. I found it very warm to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar all together. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have returned to Batcave. You could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, especially Adam West. And I bet he would have jumped back in his Batman costume if the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie, who chose not to see it ... now they wanted them to. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will be included in my collection. Thanks for the reunion Adam and Burt.
