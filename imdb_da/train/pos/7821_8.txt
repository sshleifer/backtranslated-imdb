Very rarely, Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and comes to think of what is happening to Kevin Kline, and in this case, it must count as one of their best movies. It's more about movies about how strong friendship can be more than the story of Steve Biko, although we get a glimpse of how the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the man's name and let the world know what a corrupt , rugged society South Africa was. The direction is excellent from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi, although there are some criticisms to be addressed, it could be in the length of the movie. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historical film. What is great is how he manages all extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the Breakhiet breakup, and you can't fail to move. 8 out of 10
