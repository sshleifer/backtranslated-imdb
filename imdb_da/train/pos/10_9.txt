I am a man, not given to women's movies, but it really is a well done special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a hell of a fine job, while DeNiro is his usual amazing self. Everything is so well done: recording, control, visual images, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story about real people and true love - it's a winner.
