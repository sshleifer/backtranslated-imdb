If you need an escape that will keep you alert for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. This is entertainment, after all! The reason is keeping your brain going - one of those movies (as usual suspects) where you will see it another time to find out everything. I wondered at Domino Harvey herself how her life became of interest to Hollywood. As for the play, many known looks are not shown in trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who they are has done their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a football uniform or pirate suit. And given Mickey Rourke plays well and often Mickey Rourke, but here he shows signs of being able to care for other people despite the violence.
