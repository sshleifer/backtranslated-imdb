This is a masterpiece footage in B / W 35mm film. The movie makes you see a strange way to start the day at. 7:35 in a bar and how much can be done in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The card amazingly gets you into a complex story using very small elements, and step by step makes you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses much, makes your adrenaline high with subtle details, and it is incredibly understandable to everyone, not just cinema critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European card, black and white and low budgeted. Don't let that scare you. Really worth seeing by anyone, not just experts in the genre. Isn't it much more to tell, as the movie lasts only 8 minutes (exactly) and I don't want to ruin it. But I just looked online and I couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes writing a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Really worth seeing. 10/10.
