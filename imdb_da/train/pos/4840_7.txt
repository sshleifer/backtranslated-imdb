I have seen the latest region 2 DVD of this movie shown in the "horror" section of an Oxford Street store and also announced as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. Perhaps his sinister cheerful, bubbly and essentially good-natured humor comes as part of a culture shock to many accustomed to the acidic and cynical taste of much British comedy from the past 25 years. But there are still those who appreciate his lively and fun persona and total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed the "self-strangulation" gag that Arthur is trying to entertain the stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a striking, rare appearance of the under-qualified Linden Travers who has the influence of the mysterious Julie.
