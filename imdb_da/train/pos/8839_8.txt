Thank goodness, this was not based on a true story, for what a story is. Armed with despicable figures whose dismay does not know any boundaries. Before the devil is a fascinating, compulsive excursion in perversion, which would be ridiculous (and sometimes even involving - or perhaps because of - the disease tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) It was not done with such a magnificent overwhelming conviction of its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and the excellent direction of none other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The biggest dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two big screwed brothers (brilliant portraits of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parent's jewelry store, a patetically wrong attempt. The story is told with a time shift (as noted on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused); some people have said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly and added the whole affair's skeweredness, as the two brothers at least hardly play with full tires - between them you could not make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), having an affair with the other brother, throwing in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a frightening performance from Albert Finney) who apparently caused serious past pain and you have a shakespeare / greek tragedy on your hands. Continue with caution.
