This film is so complex that it can be given any description and still scroll with it. You have an uncertain, troubled and fascinating protagonist (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) caught between two (no, three) women. We listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him work his magic around the three women he loves. This could be the prerequisite for a bird movie, full of stiff, cold, uninteresting comments. But director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. Being such a long movie, one can only laugh, when, after 2 hours of talking politely, Jean-Pierre Léaud screamed on the phone, remembering a cheesy line from a movie. These kinds of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a comment. nor anyone can restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue from Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute.
