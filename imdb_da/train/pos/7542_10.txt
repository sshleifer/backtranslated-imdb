This movie will not sit well with some, but it is a must see. I am glad that someone has finally discussed the reality of how African-American couples worked to make a name in society and how many of them felt they would stay there as "other" African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African American man (Danny Glover) who worked hard through the traditionally white law positions of the 1970s. Like any American, he moved his family to be compatible with his upward mobile status, but forgot that there were still many problems on the way. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at that time were girls. An owner a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mix began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to "get involved" so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do. And just as the man thinks he and his family are "in," right next to another African American who came in because they won "lotto" (Mo'nique) and in his eyes and he don't want anything to do with them because he doesn't want the neighborhood to believe they are alike. He is of course a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto", not one should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows you is the great pain it takes for this family to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you question where to start and end racism ... and with whom. It shows, no matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still get away from the real world and help them around you. It also shows how these African-American children, when "blending in" neighborhoods like these, fall into the trap of changing to fit the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, mind you!) Around them. They laugh with the jokes, not knowing they are joke and don't know why. <br /> <br /> But in general, this movie is about 'people'. No matter which race you are, this movie comes into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and against each other ... all to fit in. All to make you feel that you have more money than others, so it automatically makes you better - and you forget about the battles you had and those who come up behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But take a look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
