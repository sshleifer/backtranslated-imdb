A movie I had expected very little from and only seen passing a quiet hour - but which hour it turned out to be. The role is an excellent if not too serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-make-good', it's fun all over, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right. br /> Toby Malone is the true star of the movie with his welcoming depiction of Matt, said the country's boy and the local Aussie Rules football hero coming to the big city to try one of the big teams. He is excellently supported by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny. Take care of these two. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
