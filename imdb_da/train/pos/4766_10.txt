It is unusual to see a movie where a single actor's performance is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if someone without his presence. <br /> <br /> Despite a non-unique direction - In fact, there are many scenes that have apparently been shot too quickly and carelessly - an apparently low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to take his place An uncovered priest and another week's point, Pierre's presence Fresnay is so impressive that one is shocked from the very first to the terrible end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen or can iomagine in the future have a better performance, even Paul Scofield, appearing in "A Man for All Seasons". Finally, the end could be considered self-ridiculous if Fresnay did not play the tran-towered priest returning to the Church by performing a crime. "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said with such a brilliancy that one can forget the evil The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in which Morand - Which, despite being a stripped one, style a priest - consoles in a cabaret a large amount of wine makes it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gérard - the man who wants to return Morand to the Church or replace himself - must drink it if he doesn't want to leave it in the cabaret. He does it between bowl and congratulations from people who think he simply drinks three out of four haddock wines. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialogue between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you also carry men away?" asks Morand, who hates what he has just done. "It would be too much work" is the wise answer. The rest of the movie is not worth commenting on, but it is certainly worth seeing because of the very strong and weird emotional atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange movie, but must be seen by all viewers - if they are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history. <br /> <br />
