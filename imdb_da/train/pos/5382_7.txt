After watching the TV series Next Action Star reality, I was happy to see the winner's movie immediately. I was delighted by such a show of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane was, of course, his usual big self, but Corinne and Sean kept their own next to him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles. Sean's character, not Billy's, is chased, and his frustration by discovering new rules in the game is well played. Corinne is close to each other between her character, like Seans, and only in it for the money. I loved how the game was played right to the last second. Etc! Not a good movie, but an entertaining one all the way and a great show for two people on their first time out of the gate.
