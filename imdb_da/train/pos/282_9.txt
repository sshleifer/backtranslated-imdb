This is undoubtedly the craziest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-all-move type fps (which I don't normally care about) but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, amazing surround effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and all over incredible surroundings. I love Scrye, which allows you to see or hear events that happened earlier in some places in the game. The only game I've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of play just because of the atmosphere's intensity. I'm a big horror fan, especially of Clive Barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more involved story. 9/10 (-1 because I have no fps fan and maybe the game was a little short?)
