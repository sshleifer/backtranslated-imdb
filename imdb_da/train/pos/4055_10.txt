This movie is great and I would recommend to both children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than what the American studios produced at that time. However, there are a few reservations about this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought Studio Ghibli's back-catalog and then continued to slaughter it. My main point is, Disney replicated the movie, despite the fact that the original English version was very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al destroyed it and removed much of the attractiveness of the characteristics, for example. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. That's the question why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me that by having Van Der Beek et al cast, Disney can draw more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they throw away movies. It's still a beautiful movie and I still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney destroyed a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I'm fortunate enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub that I now have to guard with my life!
