The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40+ year-old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas reaching majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small city high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team loses terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in smaller leagues and can pitch a 98 mph tone. <br /> <br /> After throwing batting practices and making a bet, Jim accepts that if his team wins the region, he will try the big leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy to be a boy to play in his first game in majors. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worth while providing an emotional performance and backed by an outstanding support cast, which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes some time to develop, and some scenes are a bit slow, but it all works well at the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed and portrayed excellently. The movie is not really about baseball, but about a man's attempt to reach his dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's fun. I liked what I hope you do. <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
