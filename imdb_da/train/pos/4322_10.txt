Perhaps you will not be interested in the social commentary or the filmmakers' point of view (I am mystified by the "insignificance of the insignificance" that Kasdan seemed to promote, as it is clear that the actions of the film promote SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE. However, there is absolutely no rejection of the way in which the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism throughout; the threaded drawing arches visuals; dialogue ?? is absolutely masterpiece. I've seen the movie dozens of times and I'm still admired about its perfection. There is no moment, action, cut or line that does not have everything to do with the theme. Realistic human ideas from all actors. The scene to stage is woven amazingly. <br /> <br /> I have a beautiful level sap meter. The sum never went under this film. If you are thinking (rather than a relaxed viewer)? This movie delivers. Exponentially. Absolutely fascinating. (Do you agree with the message to appreciate the screen? Who cares if it made you hot and unclear or not, was it interesting?) Personally hit the movie me ?? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: Front-page reviewer speaks clearly from an erroneous African-American view. What he may have failed to recognize is a hand ?? shake. Not a hand out. The "spiritually dead white man" simply saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that he was black had little if anything to do with it (the color is simply used to draw the parallel. And the gap. It is no coincidence that the opening row changes from black and white to color either). If you see black in this movie as ?? token '?? You may want to rethink your anxiety. You may only see black and white yourself, eh. Just a thought.
