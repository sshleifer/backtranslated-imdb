A great moneymaker for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at a bomber pilot school. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods while their students devote to Anne Shirley's feelings. O'Brien's methods show sound during a bombing attack on Tokyo. Scott and his crew are trapped and tortured by Japanese, but the mortally wounded Scott manages to fire a gas car, providing a perfect target for his co-bombarders. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films, with moments of subtle poignancy (death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternating with scenes of ridiculous "Yellow Peril" melodrama (the Japanese literally whine through their teeth as they torture helpless Americans) . Although it cannot help but seems to be dated today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes mistakenly debuted by Robert Ryan, which had actually been shown to the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in getting a copy of this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
