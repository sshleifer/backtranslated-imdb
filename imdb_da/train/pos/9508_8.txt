In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still fears their son Augustin's death some time ago. The Colonel has been waiting for his retirement by struggling in a war against the Catholic Church for almost 27 years. But for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this ancient struggle. Without having any possession or money but a valuable gamecock, they struggle to survive with the expectation of the government announcement, recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension. This slow and moving film reflects the social and economic situation of most of the older retirees in third country countries. In Brazil, most pensioners must survive by approx. US $ 80.00 per Month. The colonist's debt in history was made to pay for a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as an indigent. Excellent performance of the cast, in a very sad story, which is reality in the poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to the Colonel) <br /> <br />
