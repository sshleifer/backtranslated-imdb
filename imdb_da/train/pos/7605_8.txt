Lost is an extremely suitable television series about some people lost on an island. there are so many twists that you can't really decide who your favorite person is, one minute he is, so he does something so he is coolest, so shes doing something then shes the coolest, so the excitement builds up and just like you are about to break the episode ends and you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode, but it's worth the wait. Suspension, action, romance, humor, it's all from the topless girls, but that's good as it means you can actually concentrate on the story more, and history is what it's all about. so if you like a good story and as a thrill this is a good one, but 24 I think is probably better. (I have a review of that too, that you could check it out.) I would lose a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next time.
