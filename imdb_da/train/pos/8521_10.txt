I absolutely loved this show. I saw it from the time it was first sent in the late 90s to the very first episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you could see with a friend or your children. Yes things have changed a little with Jo since we last saw her in the books, but it is still convincing with good stories and good lessons. The actor depicting Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as the actor playing Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series we see the evolving romance between Jo and Nick as well as the daily stories and lessons children and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.
