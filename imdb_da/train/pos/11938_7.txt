I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no sayings are meant. It's a decent, clean movie about a baseball team behind, and a young fan wants to win since his dead girl said it was the only way he'd come back. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: A fun cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Heavenly Herald Al taking the dynamic form Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It makes you smile and really involves you in the sport. <br /> <br /> Here is my grip. The one thing that slightly bugs me is these sports films that make you an unpredictable fan of the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should get away from the movie, thinking that the angels are a strong and beautiful team when I really am my base loyalty, as it is with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, it's okay.
