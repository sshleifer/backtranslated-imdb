Excellent Warner Bros with starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screenplays. It's often cited as its best, and I can't quite judge completely until I've seen his "Dawn Patrol". But his work in "the dead with their boots on" takes something to beat. I'm a big Flynn fan (he's my favorite actress after James Mason - it also helps him is an Aussie) and I think he's just great, a big screen presence and also a great actor. He is the centerpiece for "Gentleman Jim" as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork, but he is also backed by a literary, hot and fun script and Raoul Walsh's direction. Every Walsh movie I have seen never loses a pace of the pace he was really a born filmmaker. Walsh conducts ring scenes beautifully as he does with the lighter moments and the exciting, big final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to the great production values ​​("Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And a nice supporting cast, and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's sidekick, but here is his father and it still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. The couple are head over the heels in love with fighting each other.
