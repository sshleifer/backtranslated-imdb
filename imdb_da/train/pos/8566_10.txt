I like 101 Dalmatians when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 Dalmatians in 2001, I thought it was great, but I think 101 is better because I think it's more fun, more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (a hundred and a dalmation (1961), i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmatians. I hope there are, maybe yes, maybe no, we all dalmation fans must find out if there will be 103 Dalmatians in the future.
