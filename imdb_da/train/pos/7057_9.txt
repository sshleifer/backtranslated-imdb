As an adult, I really experienced this. I saw it with my 2 grandchildren and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled on the mice. The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This successor does what Return to Neverland did not achieve. A good follow-up to the Cinderella story; but what will Drusilla do? Another successor? I hope so!
