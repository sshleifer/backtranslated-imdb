Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, where the three protagonists literally run almost throughout the film, chasing each other because of strange circumstances and comic coincidence. As they run, we see what happens in their minds and how they came where they are at the moment. The action that runs is a metaphor for the lives of these down-on-happiness people. Somehow they are really chasing after, not what they were originally looking for, but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all feel really alive. The big life-running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally come in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it is fun in a smart way. One of my favorite films all the time by the brilliant director Sabu.
