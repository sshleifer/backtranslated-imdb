Very few chess films have been made over the last few years, but this is more than just a chess film. It's a story of the need to be loved, and the need to win it, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man, nothing matters to him accepting 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person when he loses a game , he loses the one thing that makes sense to him, and John Torturro puts it in a beautiful way, even though a woman's love was not enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon out there who are obsessed with the game, I am sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast, it will not hurt to see it. It is an intelligent piece of work done properly and done well, it achieves its goal, unfortunately I doubt whether there will be a successor.
