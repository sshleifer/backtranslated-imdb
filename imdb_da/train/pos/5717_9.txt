Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement and I have seen heaps (given the limited availability in New Zealand, it's pretty much), but never before have I had to sleep with the light ... until I saw The Grudge. Some may say it's a rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (but different) stories, but Grudge keeps his own as a scary movie watching the movie, I even screamed at a certain time in the movie. The play is amazing, especially from the supportive characters - KaDee Strickland is amazing and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie and William Mapother looks like he's having fun. But although I'm usually a fan of Clea DuValls, she doesn't really look like this movie. Of the supporting characters she probably has the most in depth and back story, but she doesn't seem to be there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her movies, and does she not do roles? The ghosts were really scary, music and sound effects were chilling (especially the sound that was made when KaDee Strickland's characters answered the phone in his apartment), the end was also cool. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9.10
