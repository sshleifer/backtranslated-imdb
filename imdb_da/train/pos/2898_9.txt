What would happen when a depressed policeman works with a shrink on trial? Can be very fun ... This movie is a benchmark in the Argentine cinema's action / comedy genre. Dear characters, probable history and a pace that has little excitement between laughs. I recommended it for a pleasant time for entertaining. Peretti and Luque participate in their efforts to fight a cold and daring enemy at a time when it's hard to trust anyone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin "Analyze me", but not the same, with nothing to envy. And if you like to know Bs.AS, where there are few scenes in the center and the city center.
