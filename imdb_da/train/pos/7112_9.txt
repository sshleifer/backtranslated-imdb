A very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who loses his view of Guadalcanal and must come home and resume with help from family and friends. An excellent cast of the actor helps make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as a boyfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence in her in this movie. The role of Ann Doran was equally satisfying, as were all her little supportive roles. I especially like the hometown aura from the pre-war section. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene at Guadalcanal really showed the horror that our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A charity film and one that should not be forgotten
