"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it's a bit too dark and scary for the younger ones. But older children can eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in English. The story is a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country, to live with her grandfather, after a divorce. During a village festival, the boy is chosen as a "Kirin Rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, evil acts like a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go boots and a beehive hair-do, stop with an evil Yokai turning people's anger and discarded things against them. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster leading to the town of Rage itself, Tokyo. A really fun scene has two portrayals that look at the monster flight over the city ... one says, "Oh, it's just Gamera". <br /> <br /> The young boy has been friendship with Yokai, who is a monster of some sort, mostly benign, who has isolated himself from humans, and all Yokai in Japan bind together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & crew has taken the late 60's / early 70's Yokai movies and turned them into a modern action adventure movie for (older) children who also combine some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "transformers". The look of the movie is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail right over the baby's heads, but the elderly can still enjoy it. As for adults, there is not much here to dislike if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, so you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun stuff, sometimes dark at times but maybe it's just Miike .. and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10
