That's the kind of movie Hollywood has to do more of. No extravagant props, no car tickets, no clever lines. Just people who are dealing with people. William Macy plays an unlikely hitman working for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the obligatory son, Sutherland is the dominant father. Son wants out of business, Dad won't let him down. Macy loves her own son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in his psychiatrist's office. It's an interesting compilation of characters, and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with his family members. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And as you would expect in a movie with William Macy in it, there is also some humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent jobs around, actors and instructors. Nice to know that they can still make a good movie in Hollywood on a small budget.
