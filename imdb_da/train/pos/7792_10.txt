In the sea of ​​crap, which Hollywood (and others) continues to lay out, this is one of the diamonds in the rough. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you feeling that you are not just wasting one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never really been a fan or had noticed her before, but went back and saw this early performance of her convincing me that she is extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a task on a college course for me, so I was skeptical I would even break. I thought, "Oh, a stupid chic flick or feminist male bashing indie crap ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant themes, I just say if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes the down-to-earth, slice-of-life movies are the best, and it's a great one.
