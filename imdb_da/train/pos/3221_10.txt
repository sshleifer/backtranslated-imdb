In the film there are several references made subtly to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is that Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs breeding to be consumable warriors. But as a favorite quote from me from the movie, "You should have made them smart as well as quick". Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of movies more in the way of telling the story so the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to handle these feelings, and his tears after being expelled from the group or his appalling when he gets a hug and his attachment to the dumb young boy, as in many Ways reminded Todd of himself and what he might have been, if not for his choice to be a soldier.
