This film is witty, watched and completely touching. And now you often see Jean Harlow (or any actress in this era for that matter) giving another woman a quick blow to the jaw? (Twice!) After Harlow's Ruby is sent to a reformer after mingling with Gable's Edward Hall (he of the osteic, yet scary, crooked smile), her problematic becomes more complicated when she discovers what she is pregnant. and she is convinced that this rake has left her, but in fact love has reformed him, and he is going to see her, despite being arrested and married to a minister's help. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship Harlow shares with his innate immigrants is only for her electrical chemistry with Gable, her most frequent leading man. Her cynical character is a perfect match for Gable's smooth talking villain. What do not you like? <br /> <br /> "You know you wouldn't be a bad looking lady - if it wasn't for your face!" Ruby cutting comments on gypsy, her rival. "If you're going to get close to me, I'll open the second window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
