My Take: Make use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The reason is known. An innocent man is framed for a plot to murder the US President, the first traitor in the US Secret Service. As his colleague secret service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but I was still entertained by THE SENTINEL. In this time when thrillers are reduced to being ridiculous and too abundant in action sequences, SENTINEL is a good proposition for all the good old-fashioned political criminal thriller. The well-known plot is enhanced by nice exciting sequences and amazing performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is the long-standing Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison who is framed to be part of a plot to murder the president. Former co-workers (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing Harrison while trying to figure out who is behind the possible murder and traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to many hunting scenes that are surprisingly (and fortunately) never incredible. The play also offers a partial plot involving Garrison, who has an affair with First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not unnecessary, as most subplots are for these kinds of films. The film director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who manages to make the movie look good. Although many have criticized what "should have been a television movie", I have to disagree. Approved, this is not a perfect movie and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues such as IN THE FIRE OF FIRE or an episode from the television series 24 (like this movie looks close to style and star Sutherland), but nevertheless, this movie takes its plot in serious heights and does not even leave its smaller details. The performance is fantastic (with a top-notch cast it's bound to be, even with the script number. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give it *** 1/2, not perfect, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
