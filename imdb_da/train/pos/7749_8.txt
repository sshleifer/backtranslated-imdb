This movie blows you off your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 exciting people, the building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic. They survive every day one day and one night in the Antwerp metropolis. Barman paints his characters with great enlistment and blends their individual stories, a tour of the power of Robert Altman's and Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. Plaster work of anecdotes surprises, moves, mores; The dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. Some good performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely fun duo from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman", a bizarre guy who dances throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the fantastic choreography, and of course Tom Barman took the ultrasound soundtrack himself. We were seriously impressed: Any way The wind blowers are a movie that blows you off your feet.
