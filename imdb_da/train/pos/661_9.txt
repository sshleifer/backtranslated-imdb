Ho, ho, homicidal maniac! This spiritual turn-the-force adaptation of a great EF Comics horror speech is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable television series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis makes the most of a witty script of Fred ("The Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad") Covering a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills his giant shakes by a man (a lovely cameo by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve by knocking him upside down with a poker poker. Complications occur when a fake murderous madman dressed up when jolly Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a certain unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestris spooky, agitation score and Dean Cundey's typically polished movie also promotes the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (the sweet gentle giant Benny on "L.A. Law"!), With her creepy twitching guffaw, a demented twinkle in her bright green eyes, and a mockery, really evil laugh, creates a sensational sanguine Saint Nick.
