Although you definitely don't know about Ireland, you must love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance on it). He plays cerebral palsy-struck Christy Brown. Because of this, he has spent most of his life excluded. Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over a body part: his left foot. He uses this appendix to paint and write poetry that brings him to prominence. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration: "In the name of the Father" (but "The Boxer" was unnecessary). "My left foot" can make you feel many ways: sad, hope, or something else. But at least Daniel Day-Lewis gave life's performance here. A great movie in every sense.
