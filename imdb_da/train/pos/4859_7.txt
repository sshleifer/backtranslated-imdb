I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and merged with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to make American musical films. IF they had made together for this movie, it would have been an experience once in a lifetime. It's a shame because Damsel in Distress has everything else that goes for it. Fred Astaire, history and adapted to screen by author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy and songs by Gershwin Brothers. In answer to the question of Nice work, if you can get it, there is not much you can ask about this movie. <br /> <br /> Except for a leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only movie Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was thrown into this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her character has none of the bites Ginger Rogers share in these films. All she has to do is basically act sweet and bad. She also does not contribute any musical. And if I were to judge all of Fred Astaire's dance partners, Joan Fontaine would come to the bottom. The poor woman is just awful in things looking up number. <br /> <br /> At the same time, as she starred in a musical along with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it is no coincidence that Fontaine doesn't get any musical stuff. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a colored one and in this case I think it actually did something good. The idyllic lush green england at P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy. Especially in the number I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Burns & Allen, like a pair of old vaudeville soldiers, complements Astaire in the stiff upper lip number. The surreal fun-house sequence is wonderfully staged. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy runs the gamete with Constance Collier on her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a handsome man on film. The biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is a foggy day, perhaps the most famous song about the British capital since London Bridge Falling Down. Performed in the best, simple, elegant way of Fred Astaire, it is one of those songs that will endure as long as London continues and even after. <br /> <br /> Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, a Damsel in Distress is a classic classical score, classical dance, classical comedy. Who could ask for anything more?
