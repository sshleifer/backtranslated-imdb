This movie should be put on DVD. It was so much fun and I loved it. Really, really sweet and fun. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I didn't like about it was the girl who trusted the guy too much. It represents the timetable's way of thinking. I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has only been inaccessible to US format in the UK and will not play on American DVD players. Unfortunately, it is a classic movie! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a cult favorite for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is invisible, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. She is fun and charming. She stole the show!
