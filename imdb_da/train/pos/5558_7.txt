This story is known in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that two cats, instead of one, are threatened if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has a named friend ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so it really happens "Mammy Two Shoes" who can't believe they have a mouse despite two cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyone who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the start, so the competition is on! Although it is well known area, I still enjoy it because the comic book had enough original sight gags to make entertaining. You not only had the cats competing against each other Jerry in the equation, so there were probably good gags to recommend if you are a Tom & Jerry fan.
