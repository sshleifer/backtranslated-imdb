I have long wanted to watch this movie, which is fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic subplot was a waste of time, but the talent of McCallum shines through this jealousy. Thank you very much for Turner Classic, who exhibited the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially with the way things went through in the 1950s. Some of the boys are a little scary. I would certainly not have met them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one. There was also good insight into the feelings of a fireball, or as they call him, a firefly.
