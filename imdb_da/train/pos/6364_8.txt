"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the preliminary investigations showed it would be. You don't find that often. Preview only shows the best parts, and the rest of the movie is horrible. Not so with this one. I was happy with the original plot, even though the partial plots were not. The animation was not permeated as "Shrek", but it was good, nonetheless. The plot and storyline were well presented, and there were only a few slow spots in them. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this one. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You also need to think a little, but not too much. When you think about it, you can find out what to do, but you really don't know how to do it. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, as Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. Gruff natured Commander Rourke was also well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I also liked. I really liked to cast Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a nonsense personality makes the movie more interesting. It's just too bad, she's a villain. Over all, definitely worth you (8 out of 10).
