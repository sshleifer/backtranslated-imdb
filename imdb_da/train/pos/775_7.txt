It is a strange, yet impressive story of love. Personnaly, I never run over such a twist-off story in real life. But I can picture there. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But after I have seen it, I did not get this feeling of "illness" that I would certainly have with regard to social rules. It's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... which I can't resist using moral or social rules. The film focuses primarily on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship starts, develops and eventually ends. You feel the moment when this love blooms, the first whispers, touches. You feel the connection. And no moment I though this is immoral. You even hope it won't break in the end .... it can't break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of being hart broken at the end ... But I must also add a negative spin to this comment ... I don't know if the story is somehow * showing * giving the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, but not in content. You do not have the overall story but only fragments. When the movie started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no idea of ​​the relationship. You only feel a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says everyone: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask you". <br /> <br /> This movie will probably touch some questions about what is love and what should be moral ... and where is the boundary between them. I don't know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
