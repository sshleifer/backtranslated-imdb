I was so impressed with Doug McGrath's movie version of the Jane Austen play "Emma" and I loved the music game of Rachel Portman so much that when I went to the video store one day and discovered the two had reunited for "Nicholas Nickleby" I rented it immediately without any other consideration. <br /> <br /> I have read the book and for the overly critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I do not know what McGrath might have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and the great platement elements of Miss Austen's work , especially considering the limitations of a two-hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!). And as for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I have to admit that I wasn't familiar with her when I first saw it in the theater, and I was quite convinced at the time that she was an English actress! <br /> <I'm surprised by those who criticized the movie for the lush landscape. It is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in periods set on the English landscape. The film's beautiful backgrounds are a great contributor to its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​escapist fare is somewhat softer then you might have to rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, combining with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that doesn't get tired of repetitive prospects. McGrath is a marvel to choreograph the interplay between subtle expressions that are so important to convey the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story. This refreshing film can also be a clinic about how fun a movie can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. The story is often entertaining, endearing and sometimes very touching. <br /> <br /> I've seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations, but it's definitely my favorite.
