The film is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it is still one of the greatest films ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does a good job that expresses the feelings from the book to the movie. Not many movies engage the feel of the book as well as Mother Night does.
