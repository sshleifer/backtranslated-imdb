I liked the quiet noir of the first part acting Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The mood of the attitude and the assembly of the old pole and the idealistic youth worked. I wish Bridget Fonda had several scenes in the movie; she was a serious and appealing character. The movie went out of the rails for me when assistant mayor started snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him to interfere with. No one in their real mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a Junkyard. Here the story became unlikely. Something I don't understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if the latter provided information that could bring the corrupt judge down?
