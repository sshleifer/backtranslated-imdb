"Telefilms" tend to fall below the low budget pitfalls and a rapid shooting plan, so this movie always tends to bend the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott designs Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly and fully covers all his cold tendencies and still makes him a sympathetic character. The production value of this movie was exceptional and never rely on boffo-special effects or soundstage setups, but relies on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong scenes. A movie that definitely stands alone.
