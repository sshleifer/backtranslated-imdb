This is one of the movies you think of when you wake up the next morning. It gives you the warm, fuzzy feeling and leaves you a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Certainly, we are fed the typical stereotypical figures and stories, but the trick is: entertaining. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the United States for sometime, it's fun how we react. "The deadly man must kill him", "She (Gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking greater than the end of life". We know how these things work, all come at the end. And it did. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it, nothing was really back to your own imagination. The closest would probably be Siv, she'll ask you if she really was in love with Daniel, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, seen in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely fantastic and the characters are lovable. Michael Nyqvist is genius, with his unbelievable unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and accessible. Maybe it's a little too good. <br /> <br /> But most of all, the movie makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I don't know about you, but it doesn't happen that often.
