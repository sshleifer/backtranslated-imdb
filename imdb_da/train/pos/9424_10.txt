For me, this is Ealing Studios most perfect movie - just as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released. As a satire on economic notions of growth and the commercial need for built-in obsolescence, it could hardly be more up-to-the-minute. And what other movie can you say that the hero literally carries the plot? There are nice parallels with Jurassic Park, where hugs with the environment will literally turn and bite you. But Spielberg shot away from the book's brilliant central objection to cope with some nonsense about 'children'. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man In The White Suit, Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never worn out. Suddenly, workers and capital in the northern English mill where he works is united as never before to protect their livelihood. Of course it is Ealing, it's a comedy, but it doesn't have to be. The complex interplay between built-in (if appropriate) interests plays out beautifully, as all parties find that 'progress' is a threat, and that disposal and waste is what keeps the tissues turning. <br /> <br /> But yes it is a comedy - albeit a point one - and among the political irons are delicious performances and some good old-fashioned knock-around laughs. However, it is the biting satire it continues - dazzling and white.
