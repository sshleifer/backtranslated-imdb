Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film consisting of 18 segments. You can make math - 18 segments in 120 minutes, each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. The film is based on the premise that you can actually tell a story in the short time. The prerequisite works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each presents another aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost all directors make outstanding performances from a large selection of great and closest actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful portraits in this movie that it's hard to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me was Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a girl in the "Loin du 16ème" segment and Margo Martindale as a Colorado post carrier who has learned to speak French so she can visit Paris ("14ème Arrondissement" segment). <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made to Gulliver Hecq, probably the smallest little boy who has ever harassed an American tourist in a Parisian metro station (the "Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months, so we can catch some of the subtle points we probably missed. But Paris is so beautifully photographed that I suggest you try to see it on a big screen. In any case, don't miss it!
