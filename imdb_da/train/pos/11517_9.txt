If you enjoy Cleese & all the British 'Pythonesque' humor of the time, then this little gem is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a great treat! <br /> <br /> I saw this with friends on television as it first came out and its classic quotes have formed part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever! I have it on tape and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some reviewers take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I can't believe it's now only available in the US (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be a major part of British humor's history !!
