Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) pick pockets Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet, which contains an important microfiche intended for the communist cause. She is followed by 2 federal agents waiting to pounce when she transfers the microfiche to her contact. Ships steal the scrotum on the subway underneath everyone's nose, and then a hunt for him by both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want microfiche back. Ships can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter), which sells information about criminals. It is clear that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the movie, but he intends to hold on to a high price. This leads to Joey hunting for him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who is in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline for delivering microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well thought out movie and it has a good start that will get you involved immediately. It is a little unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why she would later end up Joey. It's a good movie.
