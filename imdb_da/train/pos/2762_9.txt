This movie is close to being my favorite piece of celluloid. There really isn't much I would need or say here. Apart from perhaps "Watching this movie" and "Enjoying the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", who carries you through this neat, fun and heartbreaking story of "using your eighth day" - your own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we should do. Either if it's a pleasant career or just consume TV shows and ball games. What we usually miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - making a difference. About taking space and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day). At least that was what I got from 'The Eighth Day'.
