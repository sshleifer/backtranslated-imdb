This is just an example of Gen Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and starred in this amazing mystery. No one could have done better. The excitement was observable everywhere. I wish Mr. Wilder wanted to reach us with another of these. I have enjoyed everything I have ever seen Mr. Wilder in, but I had no idea how truly talented he was until I saw "Murder in a small town" and this follow-up. He really has a firm understanding of what the audience wants and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant plays. His subtle humor comes through in spades. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and / or Gene Wilders movie work. His star just gets brighter and brighter.
