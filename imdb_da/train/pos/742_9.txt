Upcoming age movies are quite common these days. For 1980, "Foxes" really makes sense. Jodie Foster plays his character right out. Ever since she did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. She is Jeanie, a high schooler who has lots of gut and seems to get out of any situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad Way before Chachi on "Happy Days". He is considered the immature of the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hangs with the wrong crowd, chased by her policeman's father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they enter a rented house where a party gets out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad all the time when she is wasted. The reality comes back hard where she is killed in a car accident. And you get married to a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life, how it is. In fact, you need to be careful about the people who surround you. For me, I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great plot, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
