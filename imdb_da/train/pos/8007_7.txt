This game is very addictive, I continued to play it for hours just until late at night, but also the fact that you cannot save a game when you are in space has contributed to this, sometimes I just had to to play on not losing game data. <br /> <br /> So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive but also pretty flawed. Also, for example, something that was extremely troubling me was that you could not skip any of the cut scenes with the result that you sometimes had to see the same few minute cut scene time after time. A great opportunity for me to multitask to check my email or chat with my friends and more things like that while I had to wait for the cut scene to be over. <br /> <br /> The story starts promising, but the longer you become, the more ridiculous it all becomes. Also, the game also ends quite abruptly, it did at least for me. It is quite obvious that they suggest a future successor. I don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment, but I'm sure I will probably choose once when released. The game is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with airplane games. To put it boldly, every idiot can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite tough and require a lot of effort. It took me approx. 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game, which may be a little too short. But thank God for the possibility of multi-player! It allows you to continue playing short missions, just as in the single player game, once you've finished it. Though the mission's mission is the same, being in the midst of sometimes massive dogfights simply keeps cool. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good but just nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive games, but watch out for their mistakes. <br /> /> 7/10
