The Lion King series is easily the great achievement in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the largest masterpiece in cel animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is the absolute best live-to-video sequel that Disney or another studio has made for an animated feature. It deserved a theatrical release. The same can be said for this movie. It has the original cast, songs by Elton John, a hilarious story, exciting action and touching character moments. Everything you expected from this series. Not so much a new story but filler and extended background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation. All too often Disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here they seamlessly blend new animations with footage from the original movie. The scenes never look out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly represent their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. We even get a return visit to Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas. There are many great laughs in this movie. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is just not complete without it.
