I saw it in a stylish cinema, where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The view I participated in had a sprinkling of African Americans, and that made the difference in audience reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race in this country. Basically, the white people were laughing or laughing nervously at the funny pieces - and there are many! - because they would be "laughting at Blacks", while blacks also remained rather silent because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /> <br /> I was, on the other hand, being Asian (and not belonging to either group), had a good time seeing this satire of rapeseed culture and its ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophies. Cast is talented and becomes very much the characteristic portraits. The songs are too funny to be believed. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best pseudo documentaries to come with, including "A Mighty Wind"
