Hidden Frontier is a show-made show in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta quadrant. It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most are original to the show. The show takes place at the star Deep Space 12 star and on several spaceships, giving the opportunities the official shows do not have. The characters have the possibility of an increase in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship do not have. The show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the play takes place in front of the green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are just as good, but most do just fine. The episodes are character-driven and the characters evolve over many episodes. It's a little more like in Babylon 5 than in most official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using. All in all, I enjoyed seeing it.
