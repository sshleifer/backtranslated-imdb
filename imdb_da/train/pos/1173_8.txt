"The Living of the Living Homeless" was a pretty strong finish to the first half of season 11. It is clear that parody of various zombie films, especially the dead of the dead, parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures feeding and thrives outside the brain. <br /> <br /> Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people, giving his $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his house. Several homeless begin to infiltrate South Park until the city is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of shotgun leader of the adults taking refuge at the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless while hilariously screaming "I have no change !!" Unfortunately, refugees stop Gerald Broflofski for the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and carefully throws all his changes to the bus to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them and asks everyone for change. The boys are trying to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby town of Evergreen has previously had a similar problem with the homeless, so they avoid Evergreen to find out what they were doing to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the homeless go into man's house and he tries to take the easy way out by shooting himself. But he fails several times when he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder and shouts terribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been more fun if there wasn't a similar scene in "Fantastic Easter Special" two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a refugee member discovers that the property values ​​are nosedived because of the homeless problem, so the bank has laid off at his house and makes him homeless. Randy immediately turns to him and holds the gun to the man's head. When the man finally asks each other for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, the boys find out that the city's citizens sent the homeless to South Park and that the passage of homeless people from town to city is across the country. The boys change a bus that takes the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this a whole new experience. . 8.10
