Also known as "Stairs to Heaven" in the United States. During World War II, British Peter Carter's (David Niven) aircraft shot down in battle but he survives. He meets and falls in love with lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems a mistake is made in heaven - he should be dead! A French spirit comes to get him, but he refuses. He must soon invoke his case before a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live. Sounds ridiculous, but it's actually an incredible movie. The script is good with the actors playing the roles all the way and it is beautifully directed - the scenes on Earth are in breathable Technicolor (I have never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in the sky are in black and white! Niven is a bit stiff at times, but Hunter is just amazing (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The whole picture is amazing (especially the stairs and during the final trial period) and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the movie). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven enters a completely nude young boy who hires sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This is still unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
