IQ is a cute romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to click well on the screen. Plot is a typical guy wrong for girl, guy gets girl size but does the solid point, one must love with the heart and not the mind. Addition of Albert Einstein and his genius band provide excellent comic relief. All in all, a good movie. Not good, but good
