Before we begin, I have fear of dentists. This movie gives me creeps and even makes me ring. That's what I love about this movie. The movie is a bit boring. For that I take 3 stars away! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film is about Dr. Alan Feinstone, who has just found out that his wife has cheated him. Soon he begins to get hallucinations and begins to torture his patients and kill colleagues, and he himself tortured his wife to death and killed the man he had affair with. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and gory. I would recommend it if you are in gore. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal daily dentist!
