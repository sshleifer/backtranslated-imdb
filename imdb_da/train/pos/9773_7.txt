The reason is really horrific, the atmosphere really depressing, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least for a German production. A little bit of Indian spirituality, mysterious thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of plot and character is great, the sets are very close to reality, with no studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately, some things were a bit disappointing, which should not necessarily be typical of low-budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) Sometimes cast is no more than average. Almost all actors look like a play. Some of them do a good or a really good job, but some act like crazy German court show actors! But I was very disappointed with the Mathieu Career! His performance (in a lot of his older films his plays were fine) here was below average! But that could be the reason why he is currently participating in gall soap or television series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogues are sometimes at soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound sometimes made it very difficult to understand what the characters say. I watched it on DVD and was happy to rewind and hear it again. This is due to the set (large halls as in the hospital or in the esoteric group) and sometimes the odd dialects of the actors! But all in all, it is an interesting movie, worth looking at, far beyond the commercial films that are often more terrible.
