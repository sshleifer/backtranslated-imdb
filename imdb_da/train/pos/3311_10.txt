A common plotline in film consists of the protagonists who leave the city's hustle and bustle and settle down in nature. In the power of the Kangwon province, we show two stories of individuals who are just doing it and trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. But instead of epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose turn in nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. We finally learn what really brought each to Kangwon province, and we learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking and wondering, influences them year after year, this movie will more than satisfy that longing.
