I thought it was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the film about the 2 sisters who knew that each one looked like the same boy before he was knocked off. I'm sure if the movie had been done this way, there would have been a very different ending, so this made this move such a good movie. It shows that whatever happens in your life with your siblings, that you can always get through it and that if there are 2 sisters dealing with a boy (the same boy) working through the pain and evil , make things seem better and easier to train between the two of them. It is great to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in a person's life that you can still get through, become even closer after its transition. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I still do that when it comes to it. I find myself to see it every time it comes. It would have been great if there would have been part 2 for this movie, perhaps with the older sister coming up and getting his baby, it would really have made a great end to the story since he died, so it would keep He lives even though he is dead.
