Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go spontaneously to Thailand and face prison after being trapped with planted substances in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to become a serious and moving movie, like "Return to Paradise", but instead chose to focus a little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are both good performances and the film is much more about the interaction between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the question and the testing of their friendship and ultimately the victims who are made in the name of friendship. This film does not choose to dive deep into politics or even into the hardness of prison life (which is slightly glossy) and focuses more on these friendship issues. There were some plot holes here and some parts just didn't seem to be credible or realistic. We did not feel the right fear or hopelessness in their situation that we might have. And we get a very small sense of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the seemingly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it was. But generally I enjoyed it. The action was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to remain interesting. Worth to see.
