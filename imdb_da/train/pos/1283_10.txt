The film is about a man who believes that all kinds of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to mask the ridiculous culture we bathe in. Of course, the film is in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks stand-up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood movies and touches many other media. Finally, he finds himself in the weapon he has set in motion. The film is five years old and calls more sand every day. It's the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It is also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
