I saw this on a screening last night too. I was totally blown away by how much better this movie was than I expected. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not make it fall apart in the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it much better. But I would say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and genuine. He was fun and much more fun than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was credible as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not fun like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good pace about it. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed most of the movie. Midway through the film slows down to counter the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together. I also thought it was really cool how, instead of playing up the whole black friend / white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
