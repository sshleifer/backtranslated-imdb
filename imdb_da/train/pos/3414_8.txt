This interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children trekking in the Himalayas; but also a personality wave between two remarkable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of (seeing) mountaineers who lead the kids. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans who agree with the expedition, but subsequently has doubts about how it goes. At some level, Sabine simply does not understand the climber's philosophy (with emphasis on summary); She probably has the right to identify the mismatch between the mountain targets and the child's wishes, but her safety in her own right makes her a difficult person to sympathize with, especially since she has an effective veto. In the background of this (reasonably well-organized) clash, we get an insight into the children themselves. I enjoyed the movie, even though it provides a message that is clearly designed to be uplifting - even though it is detailed about the rogue, the film claims something relentless, how amazing all those in it are. assessment, even if presented to the viewer somewhat unjustified.
