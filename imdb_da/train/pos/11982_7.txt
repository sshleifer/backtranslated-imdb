That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the show but it had too many errors. <br /> <br /> I HATE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> Stealing stories from old TV shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family." Then in 1 episode "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn's most notable one does this, especially when she played in 1 episode. The Michelle character CANNOT take a joke, but then they had this little kid act "revenge" to her sisters for a joke of them on her. <br /> <br /> History lines that came and went in 1 episode. Joey gets the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard from it again after that. Danny suddenly plays guitar. 1 episode he is coaching football, 1 episode he coaching softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out huh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey continues to work really fast without experience. Only in a TV show. <br /> <br /> I liked D.J. & Stephanie characters. Wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure & had a pure NON adult.
