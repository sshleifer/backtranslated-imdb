I've seen this movie many times, and for my life I can't understand why some people compare this to BABE. This movie is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can secretly speak. Instead, it's about a parrot who learns to speak to help her owner, a little girl with a serious tribe, overcome her speech to only be separated from her in a heartbreaking scene early. Then the great journey begins. Paulie Papeg√∏det sets out to try to find her one good friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and many unpleasant people. He falls in love with a girl's parrot and loses her. He gets rid of a life of crime and then caught by a poor scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a sympathetic janitor in the lap who is trying to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. Tony Shaloub shines like the friendly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the parrot's voice and one of the seedy characters he comes across. <br /> <br /> There is a small suggestive language, but this movie suits most kids and even more so if the parents go into the fun and see too. It's a witty, smart, epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl. He is searching for Marie ends with a surprising surprise for most who do not know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the wild green parrot stems in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially enjoy watching this movie and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not single-use animals. All children everywhere will see that animals form deeply attached themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be worth. <br /> <br /> so no BABE here, more a great trip with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try to tear up the sad parts.
