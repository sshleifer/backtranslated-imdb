I didn't laugh hard for a movie for a really long time. The waste that Hollywood has made lately drives me a wall! This was definetely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographic figures for the reviews, few women have voted! I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this ran to their computers to judge it and gave it a bad score why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is harmful to men ... it can easily be a "7" rated movie!
