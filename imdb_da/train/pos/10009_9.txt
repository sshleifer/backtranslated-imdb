When I first read Armistead Maupin's story I was taken by the human drama shown by Gabriel None and those he cares for and loves. That said, we have now got the movie version of an outstanding story and are expected to look past Hollywood's glory ... <br/> <br /> Author Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With just the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel's fragile essence and lets us see his struggle with trust issues in both his staff life (Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we are introduced to the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing ever is as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength in itself to continue and move on. It is wrong that most people will avoid this movie. I say it only because the average American is likely to believe "Robin Williams in a serious role? It didn't work before!" Please give this movie a try! Robin Williams touches the darkness, we all have to find and review ourselves to be better people. As his film One Hour Photo, he has performed as an actor and made another quality art. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he's in. He has the 1940s leading man watching and shielding the presence. It is this hack's opinion that he could carry his own movie right now! <br /> <br /> S ~
