This series adds new information and background to the book and contains personal ideas by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and gives even more sense of the author's subsequent opus, * Collapse *. <br /> <br /> Diamond itself comes out as personal and caring, not just an uninterested or pre-university graduate. This series makes it clear that his book was not just an answer to a need to "publish or perish" as it says about the academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from a person he respects: "Why do you have white people the "lot of cargo and we have so little?" Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond sought an answer that did not offend this intelligence or society. I like to think of his answers in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Parks" "Blame Canada": "Blam Wheat!"
