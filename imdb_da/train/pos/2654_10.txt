Everyone should completely watch this movie! It's freaking scary but doesn't do anything to paralyze "jump on you - just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" stuff. It's really amazing. Watch this freaking awesome movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the largest director who has ever lived. Every one of his films is masterpieces, including this one. Shining is about this family going to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as guards for the winters and being snowed in. Now the house is haunted. The child is mental. The man is easily influenced by evil haunted hotels, and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not really. It becomes this gripping thriller where things are thrown on the viewer from all different directions, and it becomes scary. Not just the classic, "Here's the Johnny" scene. It's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies. It is one of those things where words do not adequately explain it, and you just have to see it. So go on Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
