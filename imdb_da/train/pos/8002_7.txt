I've seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - both for free for air-TV in Brisbane. I do not want to go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise, as others have good and really covered this. <br /> <br /> I'd say it's so Australian. Only in Australia can we get a movie about relationships between people who spend the day as naked as the day they were born and to watch it on free commercial TV. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to her home country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government is trying to turn into the 51st US state, it is good to know that at least some things really remain Aussie
