This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - I haven't seen Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if the guy can act. He can certainly and likes in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course beautiful, but she is usually in several physical and action roles so I found her very good and lovable in this different "sweet" role a teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of clichés, and the story doesn't really ring right. Although all characters in the film note how well they look together, I don't think there is screen chemistry there. But I enjoyed this movie. The sites are nice, the characters are sympathetic and beneficial and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great romance, then it is not. But if you want to see a nice innocent wealthy movie with similar characters it is very good.
