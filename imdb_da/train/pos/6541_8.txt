As an adult in the mid-40s, I'm not even close to any of Nancy Drew's key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised at the movie this afternoon; so i could say, the couple of sextile silver-haired ladies were down the line from me. The older man who left the theater right in front of me especially praised the movie for the 20-year-old female usher (who said she had seen the movie the previous night and liked it). <br /> <br /> More to the point: But in the row right in front of me there were nine - counting them, nine-ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and sweeping back and forth and giggling the previews. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, they immediately fell down to see .... <br /> <br /> .... and didn't do as much as look at the final credits began to roll . <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; It doesn't quite pay its high school subplots, it's not quite self-confidence enough of its own tone, and its bullies are just a hair too far against critically incomplete at times. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs pretty well, and it clearly needs between the sinners with excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts wears the film with exciting grace - Josh Flitter's amazing timing is Roberts movie, and she beautifully pulls it out. Her Nancy Drew is very direct ancestor of Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars, and the film is also a linear descendant of Jodie Foster's early and underrated "Candleshoe". In today's marketplace it is rare: a family movie that respects its viewer's intelligence. As such, it won't be to everyone's taste - but for what it is, it's the best movie of its kind for decades.
