The obvious parallels between Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia is quite obvious. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins, although many of the same creative talent entered the two Disney movies. Like Nornia Chronicles, some English children who leave London during the flash and come to live in the country. And these kids have to deal with the world of magic. But, unlike C.S. Lewis has the Rawlins kids magic invading their world and helping defeat the people who make a mess of it here and now. No return to a fantasy land like Pevensie kids. No heavy philosophy here from Walt Disney, except perhaps it is not a good thing to touch witches, even apprentices such as Angela Lansbury, who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson Ms. Lansbury did not become one of the most bankable of artists for nothing. She wears her own brand of magic, that even the special effects of boys at Disney couldn't top it off. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that section of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two artists made their farewells to movies in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her final role in this movie, she graced many movies in the UK as one of their best-loved musical artists. And the great character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the old home warrior in war and in song, presents the film's audience around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score to Mary Poppins wrote a good and useful here. The age of not believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the theme of the shaft. Personally, though, I like David Tomlinson's tribute to the most colorful of London's streets, Portabello Road. Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine how it would be with computer generated graphics.
