This is a poem of movies, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. It captures the atmosphere of time and place perfectly. (Italy's lakes in the twenties.) It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and trustworthy. The settings are exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral boats in the fog --- the long long shots in the middle of a flat patterned floor --- are beautiful pictures. And rather than the obligatory happy end, this story has a bitter sweet one. If film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
