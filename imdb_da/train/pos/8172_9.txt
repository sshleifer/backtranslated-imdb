I remember being afraid of movie blood when I was younger, and gradually getting smaller until I was combed enough, since I am sure many other viewers have become so that the blocking of gory movies produced in the past a couple of years have entertained me, but did not scare me or made me twig. The "dentist" was about. <br /> <br /> The set-up seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist spends chaos on the inside of the mouths and perhaps also organs. A wise twist, however, is that the dentist is the film's protagonist, so instead of being a one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most comprehensive of any character, and he is very human and credible. The seer consequently feels sympathy for him as well as his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come to him, I hoped to somehow find a way to cover his tracks and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really "makes" a horror movie is the violence. And the "dentist" does better than any other movie I can think of. First, the film has tons of tensions, which is something that modern gorph films tend to lack. In a scene (), the dentist is emotionally confused and must first see a young patient. When he enters the child's mouth, you hope that for the dentist and the child's sake, the meeting ends without harm. I don't want to spoil what happens. Secondly, when gore comes, it hits all the worst twigs nerves. Once again I will not give anything away. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a movie you've never heard of, it's wrong. Most importantly, it is only for horror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, taking place over a period of just a few days, we do not really get any background on the characters. And the excitement falls a little at the end. But the fact that we ourselves want to know the background of the characters is proof of how good it is, and the bulk of the film is solid enough to allow small spills in tensions to be forgiven. <br /> <br /> It is strange, after many years to be accustomed to movie gore, to suddenly cover my eyes at the sight of blood. The "dentist" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable, and for that I earn my full approval.
