Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality as she witnesses a fan of her death. She is becoming more and more deceived from reality, and her emotional turmoil therefore goes into her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvising everything but still manages to engage her audience, the film makes it interesting (if a bit self-meaning) as a parallel of Cassavette's own struggle as the film maker. There are so many ideas thrown around, and as a result it gets a little confused (I'm still considering the relationship between the dead fan and Rowlands among many other things), but the way they are presented in their rawest form makes it a consistently interesting and thought-provoking movie. Would be great on a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
