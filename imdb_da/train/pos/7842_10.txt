So halfway through the season I was caught up in the school and my activities that I was not aware that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is shit. I think the supporters of this show should write foxes and ask them to at least finish the movie so a season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season. I loved the show and looked forward to it every Thursday after OC. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to try to see the show only to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not so fond of the fox right now. even more after discovering that no end was filmed. I mean, if you have to work on a project, you must at least finish it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a half car, it's pretty useless. fox, film the damned end and give some of the show's fans some peace.
