What a surprising treat to get across late tv. Had I only read a short piece of rundown on a television list before I saw the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a hit-man-see-shrink-wish-to-leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love .... sounds trite. But the film works. From the start of the movie, it is clear that the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word. The look of the movie is perfect. dark but not uncomfortable so. <br /> <br /> Except for the family's family aspect, which gives a touch of surrealism, Macy's character goes with his marriage and his father's control. Macy shows a repressed sadness, and his bedtime conversations with his young son are amazing. The young boy shows action skills far beyond his years, and the interaction between the father and the son is so very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen for a while, and I can't believe I got over it accidentally on sennat tv.
