This is a classic action girl from the 80s with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Seen in a futuristic police state, where the government controls everything, including the television network. One of their most popular television shows is "The Running Man", where convicted crimes are chased down and killed for millions of entertainment. It is created as a game show where audiences vote for their favorite "stalkers", educated kills, hunting and killing the unfortunate "participants" of the show. Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feuds Richard Dawson, whose gaming experience makes him suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) mistakenly accused mass murder, he has to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is chock full of classic Arnold lines that his famous "I'll be back" just before he enters the arena. And he cheats a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "What about a light?" I could go on, but I won't ruin the movie. It's fun stuff! <br /> <br /> Whether or not it was intended, this movie acts as a great parody of today's "Reality TV" craze. Already, there are numerous programs that show people staying pain and humiliation for viewers' entertainment, and even lawsuits are removed to their "entertainment value". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit the bottom and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have common sense so as not to let it go so far. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
