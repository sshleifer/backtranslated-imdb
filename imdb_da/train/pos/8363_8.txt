This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it has all the basics for a very entertaining 60s Wallace crime movie. Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, missing, you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, who again plays as the typical wise American woman ', you have young Eddi Arendt in her best (and equally typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young) Lowitz as the melancholy yet very "dry" ironic (and thus: very entertaining) police investigator. In addition, you are offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), You get an enchanted swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partially filmed out of wildest perspectives (be aware of the time of its origin!), yelling crowns and over and over again. All of these ingredients are shaken up well in a sweet tasteful cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended !!
