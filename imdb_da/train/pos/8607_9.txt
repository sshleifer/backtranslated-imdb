Never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy Swan song has always been panned so mercilessly - not just by their critics, but by virtually everyone. For me, "I'm married to an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the more famous excursions of the duo. The sets and costumes are as lavish as anything found in a MGM musical. The script is of the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "The Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers and Hart melodies (albeit slightly modified by MacDonald-Eddy governors Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are heavenly treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for the "The Wizard of Oz" score) and best of all, they see "singing lovers" well in their modern clothes and seem to have fun with the bizarre procedure. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have difficulty sitting still, but this outrageous, fast-paced fantasy has to entertain.
