An excellent movie and a good example of how scary a movie can be without showing the viewer anything. It's a set of four stories about tenants in a charming old-fashioned house and their various horrific and horrible fates, all of which are tied together by a Scotland Yard inspector's changing history searching for a missed horror movie star. It starts with a story of a mysterious writer whose protagonist becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story of two old romantic rivals being occupied by a wax figure in a museum, then a story of a sweet angelic little child who is all other than, and close with the story of what happened to the missing movie star ?? and what he does with the inspector. It is a beautiful print that allows you to really appreciate the work of Director Duffell and what he could achieve with a very small budget. In addition, there are acting talents Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee, and you have a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just don't answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain at a beautiful house in the English countryside ??
