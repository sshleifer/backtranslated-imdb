All dogs go to heaven is the cutest animated film that has dogs in 1989. The former Don Bluth movie The Land of Time (1988) was a success. Dogs are as cute as small mice. Oh, I just wanna hug them when they're sweet. Where was I? Oh yes. Its animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly pronounced and the songs are sweet and touching. It was opened in November 17, 1989 The same date as the little mermaid produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgiving. Carface is so significant because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! Love's surviving song by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever.
