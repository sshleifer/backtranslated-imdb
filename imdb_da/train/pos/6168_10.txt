Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this movie playing a secretary at the protagonist's bank. She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. There is more information on her website at> Having said my personal interest in the movie, I must say that I think it is a beautiful movie - moving, fun and beautifully recorded.
