Delightful lesser movies, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama branches, as nimbly as Lt. Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balance his devotion to his girlfriend Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to force as essential. <br /> <br /> This hodge podge can't appeal to all viewers today, but today it had something to offer each member of the film family, and the resolution to the slightly tired emotion-plot is original and refreshing, and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" includes what should be among the most outrageous blind dates in movie history, and its bright cartoon repartee sparkles. Melvyn Douglas exhibited some of the best lines: "I would go down Main Street in a Turkish towel before I would let any woman rule my life!" And the bubbly Joan Blondell lets his barbs fly with typical aplomb: "Good grief! You look like my Aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The crime solution here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character players helps bring the material to life. <br /> <br /> From today's vantage point, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps most interesting for his insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construction, the more formal for its seemingly rigid borders. While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes both subtle and penetrating, not only played in some of the finer details of the movie, but in the battle of genres reaching its culmination in the final scene.
