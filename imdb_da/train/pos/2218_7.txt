I know this movie was not a box office hit, but in the light of recent Hollywood releases (most of which have been formally cleared, plot less, meaningless, save-the-blonde-chick-no-mats) - which "drivel", the Feast of All Saints deserves another statement in this enchanting context, but the film - as the book - loses ground in part of the historical background, but it shows a unique American dilemma against the uniquely dreadful American institution of human slavery and some of its tragic (and fun and touching) consequences. <br /> <br /> And worthy of singles out is the youthful Robert Ri'chard, cast as the leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal which he describes at the beginning of his 'age' only to be very disappointed with what turns out to be his true education on the road to the southern plantation world of Louisiana, at the top of the antebellum period. The rumors with the (dreaded) blonde-haired Ri'chard, I expected a buffoon, a fop, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, late Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and smooth jasmine guy educate moving images and formidable skill as actors based on tapestry, voodoo, creole "aristocracy" and Haitian rebellion Woven into this tale of human passion, hatred, love, family, and racist confusion in a society that is supposedly gone and yet it is still with us.
