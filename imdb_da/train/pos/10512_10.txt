First I bug this movie on VHS than I just had to buy it on DVD, it's on my favorite movies all the time. I've read the book, but I really think the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley was an excellent pick. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
