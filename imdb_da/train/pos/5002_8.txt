I was privileged to have seen some excerpts from Aardman's original round of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always fun. None of the charms have been lost in translation - it's as fresh as the interviewed people - whether any of it is written or not, as it has become rumored, is next to that point. It's always entertaining. <br /> <br /> The Aardman Animations show great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I love most about the show and its concept (the pandasic animation, the porcupines discussing fear of needles, painting the monkey ). Regulating really grows on you as well, like horse and donkey teenagers from Maryland, most all spouses (parrots, insects and cats to name a few) and baby-watched character, and I have really come to dig the frog! Monday is finally one day to look forward to.
