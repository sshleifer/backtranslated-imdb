This is a great "little" movie. I say "small" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, like in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "evil". John Frankenheimer seems to have good luck with small productions these days. The movie is very easy to see, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything that goes around and around, things seem to get worse as the plot becomes thicker. Wonderful end, very positive. I've never read the Elmore Leonard book, but it can't be much different than the movie because it feels like I'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie.
