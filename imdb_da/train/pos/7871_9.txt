Madhur Bhandarkar aims to touch on taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. You get the impression of the director himself from his previous films like Satta and Chandni bar. The problems that are just mentioned in the latter film are explored and exposed in their entirety here. Castings are amazing and you can see the judgments on each scene from many angles. For the most part, the film lets you wonder about many facts around. When you start guessing things, you end up being close, but lacking in many scenes. It leaves a lasting impression at last. <br /> <br /> Watchers include Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. The dialogues are well-written and you feel that you have lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depths. The songs are in background-saving time, and Lazy's voice in a very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling that you are standing all alone in the midst of modern society!
