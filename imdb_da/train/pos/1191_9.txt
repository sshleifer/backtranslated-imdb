Robert Taylor as true buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the protagonist of this movie. In the beginning, I thought Charlie would end up redeeming himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the film continues, Gilson continues to do more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the bullies will soon be gone and he is horrified by the killings. Gilson is a natural killer who does not distinguish between animals or humans. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character given the self-imposed censorship at that time. She lies with Gilson in its entirety, though she hates him. The last scene in a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
