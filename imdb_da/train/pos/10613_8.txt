This is a far lost horror gem with Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to find a copy of this movie, but it is worth it. This movie is scary yet cheesy at the same time. It appears that 3 young news (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a confusion arises involving their hotel room and they seek refuge in the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays afterwards, feels ill, as the other 2 are out to film their story. She is soon murdered in the house, in a very cheesy manner by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is beheaded by the lid's cover cover as it comes down to her while she is being dragged through and into the basement). Soon Karen will return, and she will be murdered in an even more brutal way by having her face hit by the ventilation cover. Jennifer struggles with her (ex?) Loves in a rather dull subplot, and when she returns home, her hosts (as we have now discovered, brother and sister, and whatever it is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to kill her too. Virgina does not quite agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer, but she is deceived into the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost comical as Junior (depicted hysterically by Stephen Furst). It is a deformed, mentally deficient source of man whose actions and movements will cause a few chuckles, even if it should be frightening. This is where the pace of the movie gets and the end is well done. The actors / actors do a fantastic job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although it is not the most horrible movie ever made, it is very entertaining!
