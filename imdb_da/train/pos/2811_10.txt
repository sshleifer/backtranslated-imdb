Silverlake Life, the view from here is an amazing movie about AIDS as well as a gay love affair. Some images are actually really hard to take, especially when you are gay or fear of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who sees it. It is not easy to make a movie about such a terrible disease and its consequences for not only one but two people's lives. This film teaches you how to care for each other in such hard times, but it never becomes morbid, it still shows life at all times and reminds you outside the theater or in your room. Life continues wherever some people are. The characters are incredibly beautiful, while we see their intimacy in images that never go beyond a very strict limit, never revealing too private or offensive. Children should definitely not see this movie, but adults, whether or not to handle such situations, should do so and will not regret the tears they throw.
