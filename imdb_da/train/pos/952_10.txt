So did it make TV movie scores just a 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without a doubt, this 1984 version of Dickens' classic tale is the best ever made. And yes, Hound has seen the 1951 version, which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming in that version, although the play was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is simply amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this stingy businessman, haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later in the evening. Scott is really gruff like Scrooge. For the gruff actually for some critics who claim he is unable to project the newfound joy that he awakens in the Christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never dance down the street in joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotions in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> Supportive performances are uniformly excellent, like costumes, music and scenery. The 19th century London comes to life in Clive Donner's visionary style. The film even borders on scary in several scenes involving spirits. The important story of morality shines through in every frame. <br /> <br /> You won't often find this version broadcast on television anymore, and that's a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol must be a necessary part of every household celebration of the holiday. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie must find its way into the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. The Hound.
