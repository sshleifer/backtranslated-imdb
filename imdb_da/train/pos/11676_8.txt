If you loved the Long Way Round you will enjoy this almost as much. It is educational, fun, interesting and exciting. Charley shares the screen with two exciting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan does a few looks, but Charley pulls it all alone. He is fun, engaging and still a sausage of stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series is wrapped in 7 episodes. Like LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover the race's ins and outs well, there might be a bit more explanation for trucks and cars, which are mentioned and rarely seen seen racing. However, it is a motorcycle movie and everyone on two wheels will love this. <br /> <br /> The series has great photography as well as a couple of interviews with human mouth. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but this one is almost as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the United States, know God when it's released, then buy it at Amazon.uk and see it on your computer as I did. Oh, and be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
