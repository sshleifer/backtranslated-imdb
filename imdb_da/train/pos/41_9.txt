"Who did it?" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It's not just one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp, it's one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the play in 1946 for Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career ending, it was tailored to the Columbia comedy team Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror.") It is obviously too good for Stooges to pass and it was finally filmed by Stooges at the end of 1947. Old Man Goodrich calls essetives Shemp, Larry and Moe for fear that he will be murdered. When they get to his home, Goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons are trying to get rid of Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring nicht and goons to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially fun in this movie. His reactions after receiving a mickey by Christine McIntyre are excellent; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre noticeably does not try to laugh! Other fun scenes: Close-up of Moe's mug looking through camera lens; and the dark struggle with all the cast members involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko Goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual-looking characters ever to be reproduced in a Stooges movie. With his broken hair he could almost pass for a Stooge if he didn't tow over everyone else! "Who did it?" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10
