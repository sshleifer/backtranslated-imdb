For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem tucked away at TGIF (and later early school day afternoon). Each episode had a lunatic, zany energy and fast-fire pacing that overcame the occasionally inappropriate joke. Melissa Joan Hart radiated a great talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her two aunts who played the "equal men" or just as two witches could be, had great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to regret in what mad food he was interested in, and you could laugh and take everything, for he was a talked cat. Sabrina's friends rounded off the social experience at school, where they also housed the typical "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian principal." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (eg, Elderly bands, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (eg, the importance of friendship, Christmas spirit) and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magic world. Unfortunately, like so many other shows throughout the television, the show hit its peak in the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina in high school. The beginning of season four marked the transition to college, which would be a declining fall in the overall quality of the show, especially when the authors chose to introduce Josh as Harvey's rival and thin excuses for aunts Hilda and Zelda to remain on the screen as key actors. The last season Sabrina works on a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing. Finally, Sabrina (especially the colleges) ultimately remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magic elements that elevates it over the tedious fare produced in this genre each year.
