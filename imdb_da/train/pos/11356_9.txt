This is an excellent movie. It's about many things: the pursuit of a serial killer, the Soviet Russian bureaucracy, a man's drive and the relationship between this man (the chief detective) and his superiors. The one that sticks me the most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry bad spelling, thank you!). For some reason, she is moving to see their development from hostility and offense to respect and cameraderie and work together. A line in the movie summarizes me: "He would say something witty, but he was overcome by emotions." <br /> <br /> Excellent casts of all casts, even the smallest parts were made with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-paced action thriller; In fact, sometimes it moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and not utilizing the crimes at all. <br /> <br />
