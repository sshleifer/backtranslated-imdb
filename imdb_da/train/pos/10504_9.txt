Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yes it is a stupid word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario must stop him again. This game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing is the graphics, which are horrible to today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the small mini-games you can unlock). It's the second best N64 game (the first best is Conkers Bad Fur Day) that I recommend any Mario fan, or any platform game fan. It turns out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
