Being an otaku since Robotech's days, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animations all the time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences where art falls into quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the movie. Although it has been described as "sappy", it must be remembered that women do not respond in the same way as men do. Since the protagonist is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily have to resort to "macho-man" tactics to respect his peers. Seiryuu for Noriko also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like a 3-dimensional cartoon can get; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who first seems to be completely helpless, but eventually succeeds through the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked like something like teddy bear. Even Gunbuster uses a rather dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is no more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety robe around itself in true Dracula style) technique. I doubt the scene was supposed to be fun, but it blew me. Still, I would rate Gunbuster in the top 20 anime all the time.
