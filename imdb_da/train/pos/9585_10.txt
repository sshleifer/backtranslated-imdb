Wonderfully composed. I wish there was a follow-up to this documentary to follow up with some people's lives and celebrate the lives of others lost ... there should be a lot of two .. a real one. It was amazing ... the movie wasn't long enough. I want to know why the filmmaker did not follow up !! It is so important for the period of society. Well, if you read this, take another documentary of this kind ... I'm really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and men go together when they don't; in fact it is the heteros we should look at. This movie did not even interfere with mentioning HIV or AIDS, and I was so happy about it. I really appreciated the break downs and definitions as well. Many thanks for letting this movie exist.
