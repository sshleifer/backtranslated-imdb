Although this was not without its faults, this drama was appropriate to appear around Easter time. It reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest suffering and experiences. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background. The action was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again amazing. The climax was very satisfying if it was rather simplistic. Timothy Spall's "emancipation" of his long-term wife's suicide was credible and well mirrored the feelings of despair present in the teenage girl who self-harmed. The decision between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying, but less credible. A wonderful drama that left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been used well. Congratulations!
