This movie is for Halloween what the hilarious "Christmas Story" is for Christmas: both are relatively low-budget, non-big-name-stars type movies ... and both are two of the absolute biggest and funniest movies available, both seasonal CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" gallop out right from the start with warmth and humor and a fantastic cast of characters ... all five stupid Martians, Klembecker Realtor, Russell Substitute, Guard on "Fuel Dispensing Depot" and so many more! Just watch this movie to believe in it, and as "Christmas Story" it just gets better and better with every view, and you download every little fun thing ever! MOST DEFINITELY A TONE !!!
