I found the only comment about this movie completely uninformative and too hard, so I decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and has caught it a couple of times since then. First and foremost, let me say that the things that this movie is going to do are generally worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quotas and other errors. It's worth seeing. The idea of ​​basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrowed Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-scene. The film is about the kind of humanization catalysis Whitman inspired by humans. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The action - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The scriptures and dialogue are strong and take into account the mothers and bends of the times. Overall, what do you dislike? Besides mentioning another movie where Whitman is brought so alive to life?
