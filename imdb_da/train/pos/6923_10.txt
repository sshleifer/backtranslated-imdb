CONTAINING SPOILS With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor sat higher in saddle in western than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This amazing narrative story centered on a Winchester rifle has only a weak point I can think of: Casting by Will Geer as a very un-sharp-like Wyatt Earp. The scouring of the bad guys was good: Stephen McNally, who sur Dutch Dutch, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile to play both good guys and bad guys) as a smooth pistol runner. The inventory between Stewart and McNally on the rocks is amazing! I would stack this western against the whole of the western crop that was made today. They wouldn't stand a chance!
