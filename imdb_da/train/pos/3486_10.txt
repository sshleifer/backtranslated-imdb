Any real wrestling fan would have to consider this Wrestlemania to be one of if not the best of all times. It was filled with excitement and surprises. One of the biggest battles of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest ref Mike Tyson. The view that Michaels put on was incredible, especially considering the shape his back was in and that this was his last fight.
