I've seen lots of science fiction from the 70's; some terribly bad and others thought provocatively and really scary. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yes, sometimes it's a little campy, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the movie seems terribly prescient. Here we have a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are much better at this than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's haunted suicide scene is extremely prescient for Kevorkian and his ilk. Some of the attitudes are dated (can you imagine a filmmaker coming away with the concept of "women as furniture" in our oh-so-politically correct 90-year-olds?), But it is rare to find a movie from Me Decade that can actually make you think. This is one I would love to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I don't think the overall range of this movie would receive it. Check it out.
