Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural divide between a native population and the intervening white man. Though filmed in a documentary style apparently with non-professionals, Eskimo is a talented production that includes a credible story the audience will see through to the final shot. The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than the whales that darken their landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his friend, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. It is also normal for their women to take the place of the missing spouse. All this works naturally in the context of the desolate, fake Arctic attitude. The trusty eskimo falls in exchange for unscrupulous white whalers (with large European accents) who do not see these natives as their equal. Fraud, intoxicated orgies, rape and death occur after the Eskimo men go to work on the icy sea. Eventually, the leader Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. The audience would have welcomed the theaters in the 1930s. Enter the royal Canadian mounted police and the moral dilemma about whether to bring Mala back to court. The Mounties are played as feeling policemen who know this is not a cut and dry case. Will Mounties get their husband? Is it fair to keep Mala a code of conduct outside her traditional community? Is there a way out that does not penalize Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law will prevail? Is there no hope of innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the problem addressed in a very different setting. I suppose the movie of animal sequences was made before today's disclaimer that no one was hurt in the movie - so watch out for the raw nature sequences. Highly recommended.
