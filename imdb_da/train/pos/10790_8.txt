This incredibly formal flick from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" game features some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a television movie. In addition, one can basically predict the outcome of get-go. But it's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertaines. It was all it was supposed to do, and it does. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not half bad. The action is also decent, which is not very surprising because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll definitely love this. If not, don't waste your time. 8.10
