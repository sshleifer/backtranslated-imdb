Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark are a Chinese Ghost Story, apart from being one of the greatest wuxia piano films ever made, a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressive choreographed martial arts movie that should belong to each film's collection. The highly-missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a travel treasurer who spends the night in a haunted temple. While staying in the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters that includes the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the tree-fist and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the lovely Joey Wong. <br /> <To free her from the evil tap water clutches, he must reincarnate his body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even stronger demon. Some good things can't be said about this movie. Pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, imagination and humor, and the feverish paced finale will give you a little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended very early) really gives the viewer the opportunity to feel for both of them. In fact, the action as a whole is so lively and full of life, I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his depiction of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His over-the-top persona of a disillusioned sword who is overwhelmed to overcome evil leads to some good moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score, lush filmography with eye-catching colors and frantic acts of courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful movie. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10.10
