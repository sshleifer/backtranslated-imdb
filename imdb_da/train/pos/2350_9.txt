For one, I have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and hope that the author's strike will not brutally end the start of a very good show. Ned is a cake manufacturer who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is once dead, but no longer childhood woman and sunny place in Neds life. The olives are the jealous but kindhearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters along with his amazing story of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson along with Olive and occasionally the dog solves several kill secrets using Neds special gift to bring the dead people back to life. The show is fun, clean and romantic in a very sweet and kind hearted way and I would recommend it to anyone.
