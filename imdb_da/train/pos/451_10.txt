If anyone is wondering why nobody is making movies as they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, these people must take in this movie and watch the top notch writing, directing, and acting in a wonderful evening of observing how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times needed a great entertainment experience, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead. Under Mike Newell's brushing direction, these actors perform live memorable performances photographed with a sublime subtly painted eye. Reminders of the theatrical bedroom age at the turn of the century, this film can be called a friendship father who becomes a valuable experience of the romantic nature's growth within each character and also the viewer. An artistic telegram about the importance of breaking about them around us.
