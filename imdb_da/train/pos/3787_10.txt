Saw it as a critic at 49th International Film Festival Mannheim Heidelberg. <br /> <br /> Like any movie I know and Zelenka is involved in it, it's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I love his way of combining different stories and characters. His * Knoflikari * and the truly magical * Powers * (part of Regina Ziegler's * Erotic Tales IV *) are definitely worth checking out. Go get it, people!
