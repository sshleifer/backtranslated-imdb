OKAY. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During the race it has become a phenomenon. The anorexic twins became popular. Bob Saget started making a paycheck (instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. It was then that life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always came home for a good lesson. And here I am different from the norm: I liked the last few seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children get older, there is much more that you can do with the script. Therefore, I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it did. Yet. I gave it an 8/10 because of its healthy, fun story lines, and because of Bob Saget!
