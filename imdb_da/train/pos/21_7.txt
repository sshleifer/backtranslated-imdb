It may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society, and the devastating career and life conditions of any unlucky person who lacks this important skill. The story is about Iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with an employee at his factory job, an illiterate named Stanley. Iris discovers Stanley can't read, and after losing his job, she teaches him homework at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you can predict, the two develop even though they are prudent with involvement, feelings for one another ... Jane Fonda plays competent Isris, a woman with her own problems, copes with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant) , an unemployed sister and her violent husband. But Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant in his outstanding portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate Stanley, who brings a dignity to the role of respect. They are not your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in screenshots, but an ordinary working class, middle-aged couple with beautiful down-to-earth fights. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give the end away, but it's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look at the disturbing problem of adult illiteracy, albeit from a fictional character perspective.
