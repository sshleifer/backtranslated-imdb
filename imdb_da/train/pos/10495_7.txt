Saving Grace is a great movie to watch a boring afternoon when you're looking for something other than the ordinary script and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all marijuana in it is such a madness! It was the first movie I was looking at with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that did not really criticize it and only make jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small UK town and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide when he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagined having some money saved for her, discovers that she has to pay all her husband's pound in debt so as not to lose all her stuff, especially her house, that she loves so much. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener, who is very much found by smoking pots, decides to enter into a partnership with her to sell large-scale marijuana.
