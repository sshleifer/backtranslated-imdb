As an aging rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - my 2 favorite bands ever - but with the incredible cast (all) - and the amazing story - I just love this creative genius. I can't recommend it more highly - and Mick Jones added so much (Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the biggest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I've seen this amazing work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent oozes from every pore - so Astrid .... and Karen ..... what more could an aging rocker ask for !! 10/10 - bloody brilliant. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
