It is always nice to see that Angela Bassett gets a role that she can really sink her teeth into. She is sometimes intense, fun and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman forced to make one home on a desert mud bank just outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a not quite sympathetic role as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah provides a financially rewarding performance to the stranger who discovers Boesman and Lena's new living area. It's not often you get a chance to see an intelligent movie dealing with mature themes. Although based on a game, late director John Berry (who also instructed Claudine) opens the material by having the film shot in widescreen Cinemascope format. He also keeps things interesting visually through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things that are only mentioned in the play. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett to an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie that is worth searching for.
