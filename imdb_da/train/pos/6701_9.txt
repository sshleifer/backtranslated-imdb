I really liked the first 2 seasons. because many good signs disappeared later. as most shows are a bit slow first, then it gets better in later seasons, but it is the absolute reverse. jenny from the 1st season and the 2nd season's election were Sabrina friends, i really didn't care about the others, jenny and valarie were her coolest friends. For some reason I think the producers wanted us not to like her college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite season 1 episode is the cat showdown and my favorite season 2 episode is the witch source, it's the funniest episode. I also thought it was fun how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina and never seemed to have a real girlfriend, but always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wished they could have done more better. I also liked how the first 2 seasons, under the opening credits Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, like in the pilot section, where she is in a witch's costume, I liked how she said "that's it not me "and later when she continued to try to change to something else, it seems to me, but it is a really cool show. It is a bit like the Andy Griffith show in a way because it was good at first but once it became color and Barney Fife left it was longer good. but i still like to see it, but the only reason to see later seasons is because of sabrina. What I meant about the opening sequence is: The opening titles in season 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror that constitutes several different costumes and outfits, as the well-known members name flashes quickly at the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina wanted to say a kind of proverb that related to the outfit she's wearing, then disappears. the opening sequence in season four contains the characters in bubbles. Opening Credits of Seasons 5-7 features Sabrina at various locations around Boston
