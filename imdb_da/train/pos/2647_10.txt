This film can be interpreted at many different levels. Don't listen to the other comments that are based on the movie and say it's a game of history or w / e, and it's just about drugs. It has very obvious superficial metaphors on drugs; However, the rest of the film (and why I think it was personally made) doesn't matter at all. It's really mocking the psychology and conditioning of the community. It shows for a second that the protagonist's brother sees the sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all this horror phenomenon that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our profession rather than to see people as humans. As for the stage of logic, it also reaches the people who were in the federal mandated 1% smart classes that are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it looks at a macroscopic level . You must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and uncertainty principles) not only to physics but to life and give room to change your plans and adapt along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It can just go way over your head; It is not for you it is for those who have trouble dealing with life that does not seem like a mathematical problem. When you critically analyze a movie or write your critical review, don't try to read the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
