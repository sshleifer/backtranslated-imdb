I do not know why I chose this movie to see it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something else. Every time it is good to try a movie that is slightly different from the regular Hollywood Hero / thriller flick and this movie was definitely different. Right from the beginning, this movie had fascinated me, but I couldn't figure out why to the end if the movie when I realized the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought the play was great and the character development really makes you interested in them and hopes that things will ultimately be good for them. I think anyone who looks at the movie can somehow relate to one of the characters, and it gives a good view and a good laugh at the actors' pure ordinary character. <br /> <br /> In the culmination of the movie you will certainly get a sense of well-being and being left with "things going to be ok" kind of feeling. I am sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.
