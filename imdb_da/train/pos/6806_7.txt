Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors at the time, made movies full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect for all the valuable things in life. <br /> <br /> Today, if people were to hear about him, they link the name Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955.1956.1957). But he made other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and determined this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN, showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although it deals with a slightly different theme than SISSI movies, I do not see many differences between this film and the SISSI. They are strikingly similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Prophes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a wonderful introduction to his role of Sissi, as this film was made a year before the trilogy's first part about the Austrian Empress. It's also a movie where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to cast Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was her performance with her mother too. Therefore, there were some voices that Romy began his Austrian career on the basis of his mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in it. Again, as in the SISSI, this movie shows love very carefully. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? What would it look like? Only sex ... But is the only love based? <br /> <br /> I'm grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitschy, but I will never stop admiring these movies. They are IMPRESSIVE !!! UNFORTUNATLY, HIGHLY UNDERRATED!
