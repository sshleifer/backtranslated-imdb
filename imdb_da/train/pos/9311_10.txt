This was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi original movies are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote ever! Also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. I can imagine it now, the authors wake up after a long night to get tall and play dance dance revolution and then put together ideas for this: The Rumarines came to the alien planet infected with dinosaurs and have medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist fits: cannons dinosaurs medieval space travel terribly acting <br /> <br /> So go see this movie but don't buy it.
