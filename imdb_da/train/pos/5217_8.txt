I caught this movie late at night on cable and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this movie was not better known because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the subject of sexual abuse, it is a well-run, exciting and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not too weak of the heart, the film does not go out of its way to be brutal either (like 8mm). I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and voltage type movies.
