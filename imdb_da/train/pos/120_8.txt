It is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass market battle someday. Although this cannot really be described as a fault, the sum of its parts is ambiguous. The indelible quality tantalizes me to see it again and again. This is a challenging, provocative film that does not embrace things completely. The problem with the film is in its structure. Its impenetrable plot appears to be liquidation, just as another termination has been tackled. Although everything is technically dazzling, the film is just too long of that device. The long-standing climax of Leo's revival comes about 20 minutes late. Large filmography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technology provides a wealth of visual ideas. The composite work of art is provocative and engaging; One sign is the backward project, but his own hand in the foreground is not. The world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for a memorable, technically stunning murder that will make your jaw drop. The compositions are amazing. Anyone who chose to release (out of print) video tapes in the pan & scan format should never have seen it. Where's the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is unbelievable how anyone could give this very originality a bad review. You have to see it at least once. You get the feeling that von Trier relaxes more than he could chew, but this movie ends up getting richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, where indecent Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles films that take scary joy in technique as much as he does. All von Trier films explore the naive situation among unforgettable societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from this kind of bold technical experiment against expensive, over-rated, un-nuanced sap such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
