Lost is one of a kind ... its so enchanting and full of excitement, excitement and emotion all. I've never seen any TV shows like this before. It is full of jungle thrills and has a good script. The actors have felt the life of an island in such a natural way that I feel lost in the island even while I see it. It is an excellent piece of work that is told in a very intelligent form. The series is like a film depicting the lives of survivors lost on a deserted island. I am tempted to see an episode after another and I highly recommend this series to all TV show lovers. See it to see the magic of being lost in nothing.
