Your average garden-black psychotic nutcase (delicious essayed with unhinged glee by Stephen Sachs) knocks various dim-witted young "adults" (to use the phrase very loosely) in Dayton Hall University, which shuts down demolition. Daphne Zuniga makes a horrible and inauspicious movie debut here like Debbie, a bimbo who has her head broken by a car!), A fierce body of 10, okay makeup f / x by Matthew Mungle, a pair of bloody murders (baseball bat bludgeoning, chicken radiation, your standard drill through the main bit, the kind of cruel thing), a downbeat surprise twist ending, which was later copied in "Intruder", a creepy score of Christopher ("Hellraiser") Young, a small smithy of gratuitous female nudity and a creepy Incompetent direction by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this entertaining creepy slice'n'dice cruelty set up as part delectably dopey and drecky low-grade fun.
