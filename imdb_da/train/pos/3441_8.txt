This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel a great deal of justice to the crime that many people do not understand due to lack of experience. The many people who believe they could grasp what goes through a victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in his role Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This looks at rape from another, more realistic point of view than any other movie I've ever seen on the subject. The end is a bit long, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, as the chances of a hacker being sent to prison for their crime are around 1%. It is good to see a movie that is closer to reality than most would venture.
