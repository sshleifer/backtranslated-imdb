If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all their ideas and movie properties. It's my top 2 favorite movies of all time, second-world-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume that you can see the strings holding the flying saucer up. This was the first movie where you couldn't. Miracle it was made on "A-movie" scale, economy and taste at that time was stacked strongly against it. And director Wilcox's former 'hit' was "Lassie Come Home". Until I looked at him, I assumed that Fred Wilcox was a pseudonym for a director who became famous or later, but at that time did not want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a "B" genre then . It was either a very very visionary production or a very lost "mistake" among the people who banked Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are massive scales with live action, almost microscopically inserted, which Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical "user interface"; "computers" as they have come to be portrayed much less futuristic in later works. Star Treks' carrier is there, visually, almost unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if Trek / Wars technobabble goes out, FP's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate even today. The ship's set is extensive, sparkling realistically, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything that Trek has done for television or movies. We couldn't spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies came in the room so competent, then FP will explain all that. It is certainly not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'.
