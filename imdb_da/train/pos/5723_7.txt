So, being a pretty deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I've seen someone who really made me jump (or fidget nervously.) <br /> <br /> definitely want to get it on DVD when it comes out ... a hell much better than the ring. what I don't get is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was terrible, good, if that's what you think, then ... I know what I liked, And it takes a reasonable amount to make me feel really scared, so I have to say this is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> now you can be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back a bit to help build the story (I think if it was shown in chronological order, it would have destroyed the entire grip.) I'm actually glad this movie had very little bloody fairs in it ... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize you don't have to spray The red stuff all over the set to make people scared.
