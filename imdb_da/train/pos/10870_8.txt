Personally, I find the movie to be a good watch. It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police are not just going out and wiping out the triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is quite fierce due to gangland's methods of murder and torture. Nevertheless, the movie remains true to the real world, so the onslaught on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fan. Another good watch would be the Dragon Squad. This movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there are more knives than weapons (in fact, I can't remember seeing a single gun).
