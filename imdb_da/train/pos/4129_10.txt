It's a cooking competition show, Americanized. It's not going to be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is amazing. I could do less about cooking, but this show is just entertaining to watch ... From the intensity put in the bowl of the chef to the steady chair. Really a great way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as judge ... But ... Meh. It is entertaining enough to see and generally wins the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... Ala Cuisine!
