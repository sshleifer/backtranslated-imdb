When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15 maybe) I was really impressed! It has completely different style to the japan animation and i like it more. The whole impression of the movie is more creepy and dark ... The colors are not that ... colorful. The characters do not speak much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, views of strange animals and sense of magic, it resembles one of the old Scandinavian stories, full of violence and terrible creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, trolls, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
