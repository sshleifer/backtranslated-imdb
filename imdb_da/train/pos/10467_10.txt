But unfortunately due to rights issues, it will almost certainly never happen. Transcriptions of Joe Bob's commentary on those under B movies he screened are available on the internet, but they are not right on his twang-bent delivery, which was a real hoot. Today, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is limited to making complementary features of such classics as "I spit on your grave" (with which some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film all the time), and Jason X, one of the most falsified Friday the 13th successors of all time (the series was never the same when it went from Paramount). All I could think when they canceled it was: "Damn, where should I get meat ripping, blonde jokes and horror trivia every Saturday night? Does that mean I have to get a life now?" Unfortunately, it does. But there will always be a place in my horror hungry heart for "Monstervision." Long Live Drive-In!
