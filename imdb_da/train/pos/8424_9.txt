It's My Bush is a live action project made by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The view was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (it actually got good reviews) but because it was very expensive. It's my shrub is a pretty fun spoof of an average networking tv sitcom. It is also a political satire. Now it's not so close to South Park, but it's a very fun spoof of sitcom and also a pretty good political satire. guy playing in it is my bush looks a lot like him! If you can find the show, check it out. There are lots of laughs to have had! <br /> <br /> 9/10
