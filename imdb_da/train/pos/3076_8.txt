Why Panic Never Got a Good Theatrical Release is Easy to See: It's too wise and the audience would probably have had a difficult time with it, comparing it to American Beauty in its exploration of a midlife crisis and Sopranos and Analyzing this in its study of illegal walking times in the midst of family life. Although Panic may seem to originate from unoriginal material, the lively characters of humming, combined with talented dialogue and observed direction, make the film a realistic look at regretting a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy stars as Alex, a hitman working for his father's (Sutherland) contract-killing business. He leads a double life with his wife (Ullman) and son unaware of his real deal. In his Middle Ages, he is becoming increasingly crazy about what he has done all his life. Under his quiet suppressed collected fa√ßade bread, anger for his father's reigning suppressed his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels transformed and decides it's time to finish the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that author / director Henry Brommel decided to make the acquisition of his protagonist attempted to break away from contract killing is one-time use. He could easily have replaced it with any unwanted profession; His characters are so well-developed and credible, scenes are handled so smoothly and realistically, and the dialogue is so obvious and natural that the focus falls on Macy's conflict character rather than his job as a hitman. Brommel's script feels like a Shakespeare tragedy, with a certain fate theme running all the time. In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, slightly sympathetic character and becomes another brooding, great achievement that can always be expected. Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and insulting as his indulgent father, and Ullman's dramatic trip as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle store where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an influenced scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic, is a film that is well-suited to its sincerity. With a first-class cast, a plausible script, a sharp dialogue and a good direction, this character study is hopefully just a taste of Brommel's aptitude to create characters that work right. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
