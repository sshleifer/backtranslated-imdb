Clara Lago is wonderful as the film's title character, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl moving to Spain with her mother at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that her mother goes home to die and she is back with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is initially a nuisance to her, so they become dense. The film is shot beautifully, mostly bathed in soft colors. Carol longs for his father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel that love is for him. Although the war itself is a kind of back-position in this movie, it encloses character's life. I think you would like it. See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a good job as Carol. She is definitely one to see.
