This movie scared crap out of me! I must admit that I spent most of the movie watching through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Film-making my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly great and the setting was really incredibly beautiful. I read somewhere that it's some strange man and wife team that did it. For some reason this makes this even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the blasts and scares of scary movies than this is for you! Very exciting and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love watching movies curled up on a couch screaming like little girls!
