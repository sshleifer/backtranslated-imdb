This movie has probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it has a lot of quality. It's pretty lively, but you think "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close depict ordinary people, and you will never realize that they are now big-name actors. It seems that trembling in this story is a little too old to chase Eugene's boyfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the baby would travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think it's possible. You may think that family problems in this movie would never happen in your own family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
