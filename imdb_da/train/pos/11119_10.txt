There are so many reasons why I judge the Soprano so high that one of its greatest triumphs is cast and the character building. Each character unfolds more and more each series. Each series also has a number of different 'small time grades' as well as the most important ones. A good example of a character (only in three episodes) that you can feel for is David, the compulsive gambler who played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show revolves around the bully boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance his life with crime with his role as father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and it makes it so credible. While Tony runs things with Capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli) seeks a campaign. Each episode also has Tony's other family somehow, including his children and wife Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco). On top of these problems, his uncle Junior Soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can from Tony's businesses, even though he is under house arrest. All the play is powerful and character complexes, but the two that stand out most are; James Gandolfini, who is 'Tony Sopran'. Also Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern television dramas of such a caliber could not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the sopranoes are certainly Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of television
