A great movie that requires an acquired taste. If you are in action, who bam movies and hate serious love stories then this is not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie over and over, I highly recommend it. The best movie produced in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian movie I would give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even so, the other comes to this masterpiece.
