Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood on his hands and tries to sense what he has just done. Meanwhile, a CIA manager in the NYC describes the agency's response to what has just happened on the screen. An American flag stands proudly in the middle of its desk in the forefront of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan goes into morally questionable territory as if it would not be associated with the course of it action which the government decides is necessary for the sake of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively captures the mood of the movie. In addition to portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also a study of human costs by the measures taken to protect us to achieve stability and security. <br /> <br /> It's also probably the best movie you want to see in the cinema this year. <br /> <br /> It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) "This is not a newspaper story, it's real" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains stable enough for you to see everything and feel you are there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the idea is so good that these guys seem to be the characters they represent , rather than just acting actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive rather than planned for the slightest movement; The stunt work is nothing short of amazing. The pacing is just amazing. It continues to drive toward its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; The script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set piece. Although they are often simple (the Waterloo sequence is basically just a man on a phone monitored by a man on a phone), they are charged with such a dramatic intensity that one cannot take their eyes off them. The movie is just as focused on driving forward that you can't help being swept along with it. <br /> <br /> With its intense action set pieces, brilliant pace history and intelligent study of the decisions of the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that precisely captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its highlight.
