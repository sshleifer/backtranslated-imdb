OKAY. There are people who should not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Don't see it if you don't like satire or black humor. 2) Don't like it if you were offended by The Watchmen. 3) Don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, don't go to see _Mystery Men_. It's fun, it's fun, it's a nice sendup of all bad superheroes known to men. Occasional forays in junior high humor do not destroy the tongue-in-kind key fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a few entertaining minor parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Louise Lasser also get work.) I laughed all the way through. Completely invisible, a little strange but good.
