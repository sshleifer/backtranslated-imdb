`Stanley and Iris' is a heartwarming movie about two people who find each other and help each other overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read her home in her spare time. Over time, they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he does a good job in Chicago, just to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. <br /> <br /> It's a really good movie without nudity, violence or disgrace, which is rare in today's movie. A good movie all around. <br /> <br />
