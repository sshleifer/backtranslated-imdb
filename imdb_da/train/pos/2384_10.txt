It is a well-known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first put Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being "for cerebral". When the series was given a chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set up the events of the rejected episode as a cannon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the successor to what was still on that time, an unfair episode. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew of Starbase 11 visiting former Enterprise Commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) are now horrified and paralyzed due to of an accident. Pike connects her successor to the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spock, who used to serve under the Pike, has effectively hijacked the ship and set the course for Talos IV, a planet without boundaries (punishment is death) since Pike and Spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. It is, of course, a logical being that jumps in and arranges a warfare so that he can justify his actions. There is no need to say more about the plot as the rest will play out in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe by coming up with a particular type flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone on the screen and off to see what could have been of Trek, NBC had not rejected the original project. It is especially fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not return in The Menagerie) playing Pike as a more serious captain than usual, and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully established. the only time in the whole series that everyone's favorite Vulcan spontaneously laughs. In short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who cannot be bothered to track The Cage in its original form (it is available as part of Season 3 set).
