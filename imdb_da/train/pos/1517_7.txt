From Robert Bloch's mind, of "Psycho" fame, four stories of twisty terror come into this Amicus anthology movie, which, while not as fun or frightening as I would have liked, still provides some decent genre entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is related to the cover story of a highly skeptical Scotland Yard Detective (John Bennett) examining a prominent actor who disappears. He is advised that this case is linked to a few others of the house where they all took place and our film is out of service. <br /> <br /> "Method of murder", author Charles Hillyer (always lovely Denholm Elliott) has been haunted by his latest fictional creation, which apparently has come to life. This sequence has some good surrealistic and rather exciting moments and is covered by a relatively entertaining revelation and denouement. "Waxworks" stars horror icon Peter Cushing as retired broker Philip Grayson, who along with an old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) is obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum. Most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it is great as always to see Cushing. The last pictures presented to us in this story are pretty shocking. "Sweets to the Sweet" has another well-known horror star, Christopher Lee, who John Reid does not treat sweetly moped Jane Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it is up to new companion / tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter ) to find out why. The mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently; the filmmakers do not talk about their hand, so it comes as more of a real shock as we get the full truth in this unhappy family. The "dying" moments are particularly horrifying. "The Cloak" has the most direct comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of many actors who has played the role of Dr. Who over the years is very fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact, he is the highlight of this story), confused with the lack of quality in his latest low-budget movie, going out and buying his own cloak. This cape has strange powers that I dare not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as Pertwees' companion; a wonderful example of humor here is a knowledge of jab taken on none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The wrap-up story is then concluded in a predictable yet effective way as Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all the warnings more seriously. <br /> <br /> Examined by Michael Dress's unusual, striking and eerie score, "The House That Dripped Blood" is an entertaining mix of stories; While I don't enjoy it as much as, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still fun. Capably controlled by Peter Duffell, it moves slowly but surely against each of its chilling conclusions, and is certainly a good movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
