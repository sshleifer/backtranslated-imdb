This is only about in the same league as The Black Cat, although I would give this a 9 rather than a 9+. It's actually praise for a movie that has been so poorly underestimated that it's great! `The invisible ray is a part scary, dramatic party and determined part sci-fi. For a movie made in 1936, the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. The mix of horror, drama and sci-fi is a perfect blend, while the action of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. Director Lambert Hillyer captures many items, as James Whale did so often. What I say is that this movie is scary and well shot. The gargoyles scene outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the atmosphere. It's a standby moment in the movie, which unfortunately lacks in today's movie of the genre. <br /> <br /> As with `The Black Cat 'and' Island of Lost Souls', I can't understand why this movie is not yet released on DVD. When you consider some of the unwanted things that have already been transferred to DVD, it is so much more amazing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you get the chance. When released on DVD, take it quickly and place it in a decent place in your DVD library.
