Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved into the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage, and a daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Judith Crandall. Jud is 89 and could pretty much tell you about Ludlow's history. <br /> <br /> Behind Creed's new house is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled animal seminar). When Ellen goes up to see it, Jud deliberately takes the family on a trip. It's the start of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat church dies. Jud feels that Ellen is not ready for her cats, so he suggests that Louis follow him further up the path past pet cemetery. Jud tells Louis about this burial ground, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries the church without the help of judgment. A few days later, the Church returns, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, except for "The Exorcist." The greatest achievement would ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis or Victor Pascow, a ghost trying to help Creeds from making the mistake of bringing things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie plays an extravagant part. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. It goes along with the movie wonderfully. <br /> <br /> 9/10
