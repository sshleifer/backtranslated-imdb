When John Singleton is on, he is * on * !! And this is one of his better movies. Not as close as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to it (and much of the same star cast). This film was very well written, very well put together, and very well shot. There is very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: where did Fudge get the money for 6 years with college and a lot of expensive things? No mention of a rich background ... And why has Professor Phibbs not office - a professor in his stature * should * have one ... and while we are in it, for an engineering student, hick or not, remy is a pretty stupid character - I would think he would have a little more in the way of basic intelligence - he speaks and acts as a total buffoon). <br /> <br /> However, it was very sharp. A large selection of characters and views; and Singleton does not take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of mixing Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides. Much of the film was excellent; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson becomes intimate with Taryn and Wayne, each scene splitting together really well. Also the Malik / Deja scenes were really well shot too. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a bit much at times; this movie tended to become * really * sermon at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it made over your head when the points would be just as clear with silence (we really didn't use for the US flag with 'UNLEARN' written on it, give some credit, we are not morons ...). And to top it off, though * most * of the time Singleton uses the melodrama quite well, sometimes it becomes * way * for cheezy (like Deja's death, which is fine until she screams "WHY !!!" that simply ruined whole effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the play was generally at the top of the line. Amazing performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (surprised hell out of me ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls Although he was a role player), And of course, Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are always * excellent. <br /> <br /> The downside? Jennifer Connelly was flat; Although not entirely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrible. She whined and whined and whined. Yet another in the long line of model-turned actresses who failed miserably (although there are few who prove the exception to this rule). Finally the soundtrack! Wow! A great soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) That fits the movie as a glove. Each scene has a twin song (though Tori Amo's songs began to * really * annoy me at the end ... not her best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... How to Go Wrong? All in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, fantastic script, good movie. 8.10.
