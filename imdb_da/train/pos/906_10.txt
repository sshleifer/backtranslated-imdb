VIVAH IS IN MY BOOK THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book, it's one of the best 100 movies ever made in Bollywood. It is sad that this movie does not have so many reviews and does not have so much popularity. <br /> <br /> Once again, VIVAH is a true achievement from a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj have once again drawn a brilliant a VIVAH. <br /> <br /> These are the most simple and sweet movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2, who even beats Don in that context, I finally see a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. I don't know why Bollywood moves away from the beautiful culture that we have and make Hollywood remake style crap movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. The story is beautiful and very much related to the Indian system of arranged marriage, which I also want to be a part of. Our system that teaches us to obey elders, follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie! Of course, there is no power in choosing your life partner and it must be a brief meeting between the couple and it is up to them to decide, as it is excellently shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> Coming back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of travel between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage. The phase where the guy meets the girl! .... Both understand each other. However, try to assess whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the different ones that arise during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and make Anjaane Ajnabi ...... Everything one must see for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition, and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I'll just say a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
