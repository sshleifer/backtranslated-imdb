This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is also some decor in it. <br /> <br /> It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he will become a famous Las Vegas illusionist and is about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all too busy in showbiz. I thought the movie was charming, and it has a moment or two real magic that makes it all worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is great as a magician who never was, and his mentorship by Max makes for a fun and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, enough, but if you like movies about the trip, then I think you'll like this one.
