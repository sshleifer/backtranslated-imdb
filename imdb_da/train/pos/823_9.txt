Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite movie in the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a very attractive film. None of the actions have focused too long in one place. The last half hour exemplifies this most, as the scene changes every few minutes from the forest to the battle between spaceships to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another great characteristic of this movie was that the two previously were not the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally everyone was on the same side! It was great to see. <br /> Finally, it was simply a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
