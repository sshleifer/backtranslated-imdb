Red Rock West is one of the tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. It is a good pace, well acted and does not leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions as typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stars like Michael, an unemployed Texas roughneck, desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest with a mistake, but always on the dark side of fate. After failing to gain paid employment, Michael enters the Red Rock bar, where owner Wayne (JTWalsh) fails him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas, hired to do in his lovely but deadly wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) . <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for hit at the haughty Suzie. With no intention of following through, Michael accepts the money and then sets up to warn Suzanne of her impending death. He also emails a letter to the local sheriff who exposes the plot and the split. <br /> <br /> As fate would dictate, Michael won't get rid of the situation so easily. As he leaves a heavy rainstorm, he runs down Suzanne's lover. Of course Michael is Michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it is discovered that he has also been shot. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have, Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on the last trip and subsequently picked up by the real "Lyle from Dallas" played with the murderous pleasure of splendid Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are other Marines, Lyle insists that Michael joins him for a drink at where else, the Red Rock bar. There, Wayne realizes his mistake, and soon he and Lyle are in charge of Michael, who falls willingly into Suzanne's guard. As the pace picks up, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really willing to armed robbers, on the one million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the film's central focus with a number of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The movie was very well thrown. Nicolas Cage was typically low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. The best performance was the late J.T. Walsh was threatening without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too fast. Marc Reshosky's photography utilized many unique angles added to the voltage and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight direct style and Morris Chestnut's rapid fire editing.
