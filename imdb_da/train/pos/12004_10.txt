This film is a true and historic film. It is very useful for those who research the LDS Church because it is 100% true. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's very fact, exciting and motivating. There are some who think it's not the facts, but it is. It is about the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and of the Prophet Joseph Smith who restored it. It has such events in his life as the illness he had when he was a little boy, his hip Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, born and so on. But most importantly, it is the revelation of the church.
