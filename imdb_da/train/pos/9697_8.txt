This is a truly heart-warming family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that way) as well (just think of the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was ordinary poor training). The Paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and generally the characters are also elaborated. No more to say, except that this is a great movie! My ratings: history 8.5 / 10, deals 7.5 / 10, animals + eg 8.5 / 10, movie 8/10. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH TO BE!
