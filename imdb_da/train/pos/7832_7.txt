I finally got my wish to see this in a movie theater. I had watched Fritz Lang's movie on video some years ago. I was hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full length print. Intertitles in the original gothic script German with simultaneous English translation, exactly without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie sputtered for a moment, but ultimately failed to catch, at least for me. This movie has no real relation to Wagner's Ring cycle that I already knew, but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - has much that is known to listeners of Wagner. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) Hunen, and her desire for revenge on Hagen and Gunther, the rechristened Nibelungs, to Siegfried's murder. The spectacular conflagration of this film probably developed and expanded in the Viennese myths in his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and Valhalla's end. This film remains the soil. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The massive sets compete with "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendor. There is a large cast of scarred, mangy dogs and art deco burgundy animals. And fighting. Battles that never seem to end in reality. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in her revenge plan. She manages to destroy herself around her. Her loyalty to her martyred Siegfried does not seem to stem so much from love or affection, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "Unsex me here." She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what to do. But Kriemhild shows no normal human feelings, and certainly not something that corresponds to the feminine principle. She is already "top full of direst cruelty" to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the start. Margaret Schön and her instructor convey this with a glow. I do not want to exaggerate, but it is almost the only expression that is ever to "animate" Kriemhild's face. It is the ultimate in one-tone performances. However, it is clearly intended, not just a case of bad action. <br /> <br /> What we have offered is a one-dimensional sketch of a mocking rage. Some may see Kriemhild as an authorized heroine. I just see the movie as misogynistic.
