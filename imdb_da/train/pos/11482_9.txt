This movie is essentially shot on a handheld camera by the actors in it. In some ways, a mockumentary in other ways is a video diary from killers full due to a "Columbine" style attack. While this movie does not respond to all the major issues, it gives you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with. Through the film, you will be shown how the actors illegally shortened shot weapons, made tubular bombs and came up with a "Zero Day" action plan. The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, of course they borrowed heavily from their own lives, but by no means did I really discover them acting (something Tom Cruise would try). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was genius, but I'm not sure we needed the very first scene. Overall, a really good movie on a very difficult topic.
