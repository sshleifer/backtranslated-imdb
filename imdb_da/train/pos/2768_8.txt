Other than Susan Hayward's wood delivery throughout this movie, it was as good as any Bible movie made. Henry King handles this movie with respect for an epic in all small scenes, and Peck is as always impeccable. The agitation Alfred Newman sound score, with the stirring thirty hymns, is unforgettable even after these many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that is badly done for the era in which this movie was made. This goes well with today's smaller Bible stories, "The Ruth's Song" and "Esther and the King." It's worth looking at, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the Prophet Nathan. The film is rounded off by the always fine James Robertson Justice like Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's alien first wife.
