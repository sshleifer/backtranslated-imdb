This has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who is in extinction. he sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respects that it is primitive in good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness add clearly as you see him work in so simplistic yet full of life-like, immediate works of art. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes early, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly. The film is shot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy's art has. It combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix everything without disturbing the naturalistic sound. This is generally a great job in every aspect. It has no limits as far as age goes.
