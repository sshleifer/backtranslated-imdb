I've also just returned from an advanced screening of Redeye, and I have to say that I haven't had so much fun on a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is the best ever. He brings us to a great end of the summer thriller I was so desperately needy. This is this year's thriller .. no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X was great. It's constantly built excitement. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been a while since I heard an audience cheer and pat and get excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> Looking for excitement, action and good plot this summer, REDEYE delivers. Go see it!
