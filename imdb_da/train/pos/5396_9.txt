Simple, meaningful and delivers an emotional blow. I regularly go through boring short films, and it's always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message, without pretensions or self-assertive management. <br /> <br /> A boy in school should attend a lesson when his friend plays loyal and gets the most important lesson in his life, only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around, he shares with the school bully. Unlike most short films with children or actors these children keep their own and it is credible. The sound track complements the feelings of the play well and the film's stroke line works well.
