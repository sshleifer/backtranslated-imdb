As a young boy, I always kind of hated "Cinderella" when I was watched by my two sisters when my parents considered what Disney movies should buy. I wanted "Dumbo" but my sisters won out and we got "Cinderella." They thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I swung the back of the room with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> Much has changed since then. My love for Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young nieces. I like to show Disney as much as possible and we have recently seen "Cinderella" together. With my newfound understanding of everything that is Disney, I saw "Cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> However, from the beginning of the movie I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was caught in such a terrible situation. Why was she such a slave to her stud family, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but when the story progressed, I found myself immersed in history. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun loving characters took me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is a Wish That Your Heart Does" kind of wiped me back into amusement parks. I can picture myself in the carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe inspiring Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie just causes Disney's magic. It can make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up as Cinderella who are thrilled to be in this fantasy world and you know what I'm talking about. The pictures of Cinderella and the glass pipe - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - show why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the world. While "Cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it's kind of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents the fun, idealistic and fantasy-like marvels we held when we were children. I imagine this movie has many meanings for many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)
