Spoilers - to the extent I describe signs and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The subject is immediately cloudy and gripping. The ruling of Stephen Ren's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With any kind of excuse for him, his pendant, which is constantly printed, serves the character well. He is, as we in England would say about the nature of the Taggart TV inspector, bound to be miserable because he sees three murders a week. Well, it's not exactly exactly when Chikatila has worked over a number of years ... You get a real sense of the gentle resistance of the USSR bureaucracy, splendidly depicted by Joss Ackland (who often seems made for this kind of role). A key character (and I write this as the remake of invasion of Body Snatchers being shown on BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support from Burakov is fixed. And it continues through Perestroika, and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see as far as I'm concerned.
