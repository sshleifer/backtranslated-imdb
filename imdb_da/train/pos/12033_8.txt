When I whistle through the TV guide and came across "Twisted Desire" on the movie section, I read that description. Three words caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" absolutely in vain, I hate those kinds of programs, so I just thought it should be a boring old, love story with the head on her ... Little did I know. <br /> <br /> It finally started on television, I had my forest ready if I had to brush on the cheesiness or soppiness you know what I mean. In the beginning, you think she is just a nice, ordinary girl who is in love, but has significant parents. So when you find out, she has manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents so she could be with her TRUE love, you are like "Whoa". You don't expect this kind of role for that kind of actress. She played her role very well in my opinion, I had never expected her to act like such a bitch, and voil√†, she made it perfect! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I would definitely see it again and recommend it to others.
