The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too badly they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you should see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious movie bird or for anyone interested in the still maligned Marion Davies!
