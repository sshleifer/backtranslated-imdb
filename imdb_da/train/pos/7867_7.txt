Madhur from CHANDNI BAR started making realistic films as some called dry <br /> <br /> He made SATTA, another realistic but cinematic movie, but a great movie <br /> <br /> ON men at work was a formula film of him who flopped. He returns with his superlative side 3 <br /> <br /> A movie that works in the lives of journalists and it is a brilliant movie <br /> <br /> The movie is well told, though the half-baked romantic parts of Konkana could be avoided, but it is forgiven. <br /> <br /> The entire Upendra Limaye track is also great <br /> <br /> while the Atul Kulkarni track is also fantastic <br /> <br /> The disc between Manoj Joshi and his friends is fun first but repeatedly <br /> <br /> Bikram-Tara's subplot is brilliant and it is the whole hospital scene and also the final child abuse that shocks you <br /> <br /> The movie has an open ending that is handled nicely <br /> <br /> Madhur makes a good piece of music Music is okay <br /> <br /> Konkana stands out as crazy Havi, using her expression to the best Tara Sharma is decent except her voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual Upendra Limaye excels in his role as a policeman, one of the talented actors Unfortunately he is not used well now today Atul Kulkarni is also good in his small part Boman Irani is detained and has a good work stay in order
