This picture came out in 1975 and it was second in the three parts of Sheriff Buford's life. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last one we saw Sheriff Pusser, he was in a hospital bed after him and his wife, who were killed in unnoticed Sunday morning driving. After Pusser's return, he goes after the men who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge he succeeds, or tries the mob to take him out before he succeeds. The only thing that disturbs me about this picture is that this was a truly true story. How could you leave in a city with this kind of crime and yet do nothing about it. Since there was really no name actress in this picture, I can't give it 10 tissue stars, but I can give 8
