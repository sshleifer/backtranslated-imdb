I rank this to the best of Zorro's chapter views. The exciting musical score adds strokes to an exciting play. There is an excellent supportive cast and mysterious villain who will keep you guessing until the last chapter. Rede Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the great director of Whitney and English.
