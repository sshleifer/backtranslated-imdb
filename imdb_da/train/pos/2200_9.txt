The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early-stage comedy "Mr. Peepers" were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on NBC. Like a lot of baby boomers, this and "Ding Dong School" are my earliest memories of television. Since both ran later in syndication, it is difficult to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts. "Mr. Peepers" is worth checking for more than the value of the nostalgia. It represents a very different situation with comedy than shows like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions these days and ended up taking the heavy grinding path of the two shows; which is probably that they still seem modern. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", which was differentiated by its intelligent detained tone, may seem slow and dull in comparison. But it's really more a matter of adapting to the different style. When you enter the characters, it wins over most intelligent viewers. The credit will give the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producer Showcase", "Playwrights 56" , "Fireside Theater" etc.) Even in Chinese. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" offered a much more gentle style with Wally Cox (to be "Underdog's voice a few years later") in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a mild-mannered high school science teacher. His glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer. <br /> <br /> The series provided Cox with an excellent support molding. Tony Randall played his brash best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the senior gym teacher, whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflicting elements. <br /> <br /> There is some love competition competition involving the school nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), with viewers who quickly adapt to Mr. Peepers who seem a much better match for the gentle Nancy. Their on-screen marriage at the end of the 1953-54 season caught national attention, an early version of "Who Shot J.R.?" frenzy. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
