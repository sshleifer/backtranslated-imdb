According to this forum, I think whether you love it or hate it. Usually, how it goes with any movie. However, there is no need to become testy with others themselves. Everything we do here gives opinions. I rented this movie last night, and I will come and throw my opinion in the mix. I was surprised at how many people throw it. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a horror movie fan. Most ordinary oil movie fans do not like horror movies. So many low-budget video cameras that watch movies come out these days. It's hard to stop. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review about "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's pretty amazing compared to the rest of the unwanted out there. It's nothing special, but it's these horror movie makers trying to be too serious to end up making a horrible horror movie. I really liked this one. You tell me there is no effort in this? And another thing I bet all you have is all those great DVD collections that you are so proud of, nothing but Major Motion Pictures right? Nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to value low-budget ones. I knew what I got when I watched this movie. I'm not going to be sorry because I thought it should be $ 100 million movie. Some of you may need to stick to seeing the Matrix over and over and stop trying to compare everything to the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, it explains everything. Good movie people, check it out.
