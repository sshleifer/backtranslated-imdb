First of all, the kingdom is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Great combination of strange 'dogma' style to tell the story along with good music and good actors. But unfortunately there is no 'end'. For me, it is unacceptable. I thought ... how will it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mayble a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not make small experiments with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (such as "team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even computer 3d animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I think it could work ... only in this way is it possible to make the actors live again. For Kingdom fans this should not be so much different - if the animation will be done well, average 'watcher' will consider it normally just after the first few shots from the movie. The most important thing is now the story. It is quite understandable that it is not possible to create Kingdom 3 with the actors today. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities it gives you! Even marketing one! Large instructor completes his trilogy after 10 years using doll animation. Just dreaming? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Kingdom 3 one day ... or even just to see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and what I expect - everyone here does. <br /> <br /> greets, beats <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about "King's Hospital" by Stephen King ;-)
