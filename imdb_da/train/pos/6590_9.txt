Intelligent, angry and exciting, "The Invisible Man" stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual lineup, which balanced "Farscape "'s amazing artistic direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility gauge, but the fact that "I-Man "'s characters went beyond caricature was not denied. Even signs that predicted predictability like Keeper, Official and Eberts were given from the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving community of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science is only sometimes cursed at the incredible. The low points of the show are still entertaining and I have never seen such tight pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD version of the show. Every time I cross a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, provide the excitement and ability of science fiction television that "Invisible Man" and its ilk represented.
