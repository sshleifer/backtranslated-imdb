La Teta in la Luna describes the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, who is obsessed with breasts growing up in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's movie (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how exciting and exciting life can be in that age. Also from Catalunya (north-east of Spain) it brought many memories to my mind. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, lovely life and especially many non-tight people.
