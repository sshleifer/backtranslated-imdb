What can you say when you see a good French film trying to draw an exciting story in line with the characters' social background? The main point is that we believe in these characters, and when they have met, we want to have them together. It's simple and very effective. The background story is less important. Why does the manuscript go to the side of a semi-developed thriller? It does not help to get stuck in the social demonstrations that most French film journalists would like to make. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is only an entertaining French film with good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the clever noir points in the manuscript, the ending is far too easy. It goes just as easily as in the back window (an obvious reference and certainly not a noir film), but with a less convincing context. Where I am amazed at it is to see that the character of the sampler is not erased. He brings very little to the story; when he looks alone we ask if we haven't missed a lot before. Jacques Audiard has not yet arrived. Strange and weird.
