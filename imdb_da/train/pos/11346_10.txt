I grew up with H. R. Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters are also inciting fans of Jack Wild. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertaining. This movie is also not limited to children. Much of the dialogue is aimed at adults, and Witchiepoo's performance is something you will not miss. The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully. And like the Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the chance to see him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the Hard Life Jack had now made this movie even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me pause in loving worship for him to give me wonderful childhood memories that I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by sending Pufnstuff to others.
