There aren't many movies around that have given me a feeling that Stardust did it all during the film. As a magical fairy-tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is absolutely the most amazing play from the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, fun and equipped with wonderful images as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiros, I especially challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie you know very well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that attracts the viewer from start to finish. Ten stars, and not a decimal smaller.
