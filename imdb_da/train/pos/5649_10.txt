I see the series again so it is out on DVD (yay!) It hits me as fresh as relevant and as exciting as when it was first sent. <br /> <br /> The key performances are gripping, scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I keep my neck out and set it up there with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans and still be seen coming 2035. <br /> <br /> I have been asked to write some more lines (it seems IMDb is that uses unfriendly and anal retentively coded as ever! Pithy and to the point is clearly not the IMDb path.) Well, unlike IMDb's editors, American Gothic understands that simplicity is everything. In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. In addition, the issue of personal ethics and character strength in a way that challenges the viewer to ask themselves each time what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show first aired, I was still grieving for Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off. Personally, I begin to judge it more strongly and suspect that it will be better over the years. Believe it will be no more controversial than that!
