When I first saw this movie, I thought it was the typical "love your neighbor" thing .... The more the movie was going, the more I became involved. Action is magnificent from both actors, direction was great, the story unusual. Cry my eyes, the first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10
