All the people who are going through this movie, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it. This film was made with food sequences and art techniques, like the works of the great Czech filmmakers, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of Zeman's movies, such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time or Comet. If you can't find a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If you were to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci / fi fantasy films of the time, the viewers would probably not have got it then either. It is unfair to compare one of these filmmakers' styles to today's standard technologies because both Zemen and Hines do not "calculate". They have a style that is unique to them and should only be judged for their creativity. If you look at this movie from a perspective where you know he deliberately tried to create a pastiche collage of matting mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It's not easy to make a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. Hines took a good game, and I think his films will not be judged in the years to come. Someone advertising the movie should have tipped the audience out of what they wanted to see, rather than letting them blindly enter the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zeman's book, as many of Zemena's actors were initially expressive, but became much more engaging when the film and action took place. It is quite refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I want to see it in the coming years, all three big hours of it.
