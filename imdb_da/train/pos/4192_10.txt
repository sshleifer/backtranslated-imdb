In what will probably be on my list of Fuller's best films (that is, when I see more of them, just this and Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a movie noir where femme fatal, as well as the male protagonist, is not the stereotype of the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the New York-style feel that is not normally found in the Hollywood Noirs. On a small budget - at least for people like Darryl F. Zanuck-Fuller and his actors creating personas that like themselves in such a dark atmosphere. The good people are basically those who do not become violent with yourself as they look for an extra buck. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all great in leading parts. Widmark are just a few players I can think of who really could have drawn this character. He is a bit like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a clever ass, who is a bit creepy. On the other hand, Skip McCoy has a set of values ​​in his life. He does not go into the affairs of others and does not try to worry about much of the working life outside his little hut on the river after he has been sent away for three years. He slides up, unfamiliar to him when he pockets a woman (Peters) on the train and promises a thing that is under the government's eye. It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money. But at what price is the film's centerpiece, as it involves Stoolie Moe (Ritter is one of the finest and most credible character actors of the period), the woman's ex (a fleeting Kiley) and the police authority. <Apart from the thematic elements that are told with a dramatic journalistic style (which was also Fuller's former position with the boxer), the dialogue is fresh and involves. There is spontaneity in many of Fuller's camera movements. And what third action. This is a lean, tight movie noir worth checking out even if you are not familiar with Fuller (it is relatively less bizarre than some of his later works).
