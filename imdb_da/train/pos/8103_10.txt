This was the most expensive movie when it was produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells was both worried by his bad reviews --- for good reason. It was and remains far ahead of its time. Apart from the seemingly bad direction, probably editing in the beginning, the work goes on to a great conclusion. <br /> <br /> about its ralph richardson's 'boss' role or even better his wife Sir Cedric's, as an opponent of spaceflight, Raymond Massey's 'John Cabal' center role - all deliver scary performances. <br /> <br /> The scene with Mr Korda's incomparable set, of the little girl-child, runs out to a "never-to-match" scene that comments on "Life just gets more lovely and lovelier"? that quickly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. This is not a movie for the young - unless "experienced" and rather those who have seen "horror" it opposes. <br /> <br /> sure, "false parachute" looks hokey --- while using a "magnetic cannon" now referred to as "mass driver" can be considered ridiculous, versus rockets --- give Sir Korda a break - Mr Wells made that choice. And at +/- $ 8 million, this movie went far beyond "over budget" --- so he concentrated on what he could do. <br /> <br /> The real power of this greatest cinema rests in 'John Cabal's final account of man's destiny --- his friend' Passworthy 'doubts the spacecraft's wisdom and says:' We are such small animals. 'The correct answer of John Cabal is (rewritten)' Yes, small animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such. ' they are under a large astronomical telescope. He sweeps his hand over the night sky. "But we can have the whole universe or nothing." - then the last cow goes in --- "What should it be?" --- It is not 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner' --- all you can consider 'Great' --- this is the right thing. I recall all of Steven Hawking's latest address, on his latest 'Medal of Honor' --- 'Man must leave Earth or die.' - - the core of this work --- I love 'standard entertainment' --- but This 'relic', for the wise viewer, offers much more. "What should it be?" be in the right 'mood' - whatever that requires --- this will catch the breath --- I 'guarontee' --- generally for humanity? the most significant of cinema. <br /> <br /> Since posting, I am aware that many have commented on the poor "media quality" of "survivors" examples. In the 80s, I developed a 'proprietary' 'dyeing' process that required a 'clean' original. this led me to Michael Korda, who unfortunately noticed that everyone was gone --- so we must enjoy what is left --- 'sad but true'?
