I am a college student studying A-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has views on the theme of Mothers in Film, in the mother. Whether you've reviewed something similar or just want to comment and help me explore more about this movie, any comment will greatly appreciate. The comments will only be used for the exam and will be included in my written examination. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I can put them to use and you can help me get an A! I also study 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole', so if you have seen these movies too, I would appreciate it if you could leave comments on that page. Thank you.
