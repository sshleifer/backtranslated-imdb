When you come across a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the 80s were the greatest decade to live through. Rock music, and also movies ... especially horror movies. Filmmakers knew how we entertained us, & "Trick or Treat" is clear for this. When rocker Sammi Curr, most likely written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie, is confused. He goes to the friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the very first recording that Sammi made; This is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, somehow it brings Sammi back. He helps Eddie with the bad guys in school, but then goes out of control. It is definitely a fantastic movie. The bad thing is that this movie is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 for finally getting it off eBay. You should also ... $$ well used!
