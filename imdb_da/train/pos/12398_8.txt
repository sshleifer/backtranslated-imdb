What was always lacking in the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world. Say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases. It was really interesting how politically it was, perhaps even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things one could think of to combat the robotic horror, which was intended only as servants of humanity. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was sustained by the idea of ​​the unknown. We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often, so the lack of logic and thinking takes us over because people can't believe the opposite. Well represented and composed, this is a true testament to how illogical people can be.
