When it comes to movies, I can be pretty picky and I will complain about everything that has been done wrong. While each movie has its faults, Night Listener had an unusually low number. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult as half of it was written in caps and it didn't contain any real information about the movie), you may have thought that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you have discovered the poster's cause of contempt: he / she does not like the director to be gay (or that the production team smokes ... apparently). <So despite the fact that I've never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its benefits, not its sexual orientation. Let's go over a quick checklist first: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I will not give away a piece of it, but the plot is very convincing and definitely not what one would expect based on advertising. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be used as such. The story will really amaze you, even more so because it is true (and the plot was entirely true to the actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful Acting? Oh yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chain of the comedy cast, and he has since flourished in serious roles that many people would have written to him just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who is increasingly concerned and anchored in case ... well, I let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Safe. Now, unlike the other poster I mentioned, I actually know something about direction. I have sutdying the right art at school now for 3 years. Of course, I really don't think there is a kind of difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but I thought I should just say that I base my opinions on something that is both essential and relevant ... for example: not the director's sexual orientation (or the production team's alleged habits). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was mood and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create the sought after feelings of "excitement and release" instead of the messy, fast-paced camera work and quick cuts that we are so often exposed to today. Some people can really show you a story through their camera while others feel as though they are making the story with the camera. I appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as it should be, which is like an eye we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, Filmography and Editing? Great all around. I've already written so much and I could continue on the last three things in another ten paragraphs, so I just wanna unpack it. <br /> In short, watch this movie. Do not listen to people who have prominent motives for garbage, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal the motive 1/4 of the way through their speech. Enjoy the show! -Leg
