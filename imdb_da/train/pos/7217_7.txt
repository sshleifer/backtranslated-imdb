Internship adjustments often have a big mistake. They often appear that a movie camera was simply placed on stage (like "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's direction keeps the movie alive, which is particularly difficult as the picture did not give him any real challenge. However, it is fun to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is amazing as always, and Reeve gets one of his few chances to really act. <br /> <br /> I confess I have never seen Ira Levin's play, but I hear Jay Presson Allen's fidelity is true. The script is incredibly unnoticed and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is an extremely entertaining movie and is recommended for almost all fans of the stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
