It's been a while since I've seen this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is absolutely true to the original work. Visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Occasionally, the movie is confusing or confused. There is one or two times where the story is delayed to a crawl. But in general - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
