It takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so miserable, beguiling, disgusting and repulsive, but does it in a way that also makes it brilliant and characteristic of personal cinematic liberation. Crispin Glover, in all its "out there" antics and preaching, really created something unique. In a world that has become highly partisan, this film seems to evade the normal lines of creativity and art and effectively disturb everyone. <br /> <br /> Right from the bat, the film takes a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model at all) and initially forms with similar Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasure a man with cerebral palsy. These are pretty shocking things, but if you had the opportunity for the Q&A sessions after the screening, it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leave you wondering if it's art or just the lowest common denominator. In one form or another, you sense the tremor that this movie will eventually bring. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed authors of the world, discussing the human condition in a debate. You don't like it, but it's definitely worth seeing.
