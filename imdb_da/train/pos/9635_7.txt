The romance of the film, which is also the main theme, is presented well and nicely. However, the environment of love history is lyrical, graphic, and unrealistic. Even worse, the protagonist's psychology is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the movie. Don't hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest, but don't expect too much of it either.
