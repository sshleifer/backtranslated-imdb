For many people, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative with the hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> The young Lee lives in NY in the 80s when hip hop was in the beginning. He is a crew member on "Beat Street" - a b-boy crew. The film follows Lee in his average day, dance, graffiti etc. The director has managed to make a movie with a plot and at the same time present hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie features old-fashioned features like <br /> <br /> Africa Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel and Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers and many more .... <br /> <br /> Neither the movie Beat Street nor the Beat Street Spirit will ever die.
