The beginning of this movie is a bit lumpy and also confusing, but is tight because you are in life for life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices used to tell the overall story. There are good performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. The Management of Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a seventies feel in the sense that there are risks in the story of this story, but unlike most trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller who is genuinely based on relationships rather than special effects or product plug. You will be highly rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
