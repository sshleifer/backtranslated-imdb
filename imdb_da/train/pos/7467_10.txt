David Aames is a great guy living in New York City. When his sleeping partner Julie Gianni gets very jealous after David falls to Spanish beauty Sofia, she gets David into his car and tells him that he is the only guy she loves and wants to be with but when he is in love with Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her by driving from a bridge. David survives the collapse, but is left with a fateful face. He is then accused of the assassination of Julie. The thing is, David does not know what is right and what is not as he holds on to these weird dreams (most are actually nightmares.) And flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense to him. Everything comes back to him soon, even though he begins to find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Now there is an all star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, all of whom give good performances in the movie. In the film they all struck different things about there signs, like happiness, sadness, angry, etc. Very good. There is also a como in the movie from the brilliant Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-functioning, different, interesting and original film that will let you talk a lot about it when it's finished. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is really good, but the film is so different from what it can be made to be. It has been corrected very well, and there were also a couple of really good scenes here. All in all, an enjoyable movie, which should also pay attention. They are sure to make a lot of "Are the Dead, If Not Who's Dead" movie recently.
