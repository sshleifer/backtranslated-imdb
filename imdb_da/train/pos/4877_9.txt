In fact, a particular person / character is not "right there", but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And all this is achieved without the desire for camera movements and / or large production sets, but with a great story and much (credible) and good actors who convey the story (bow). You can call it a companion piece to big japan movie / cinema (such as Tokyo Story etc), not so much history-wise of course, but more mood-wise! Great acting, nuances in the performances that are truly precious stones. If you are eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie that touches you emotionally than this is the one to go. As you have noticed (as with many of my reviews), I do not come into history. There are places here on IMDb where you can look them up, I'm not one to spoil the story at all!
