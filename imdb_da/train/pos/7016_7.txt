Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still found it amazing. It will touch you, and unless your critic goes deep into the mistakes and mishaps of each movie, or you simply are not affected by anything, it is worth seeing. Don't get into the movie expecting something, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the play is brilliant. I think Will Smith, even though he is playing another lonely depressed person again, is amazing. I think a good actor is someone who can really depict emotions and feelings that we all have on our worst / best experiences in such a way that it reaches you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a try.
