Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and also a copy of this on DVD. There is just enough variation in scripts to make all three entertaining and reverent. In addition, any other movie has been remade three times with such all-star casts in each? Of course, the most important stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also amazing. I especially like William Tracy as Pepi. He was such a scene stealing as I have been trying to find other movies he is in. He appeared in many, but most are not available. Like the other comments, I also say - buy this.
