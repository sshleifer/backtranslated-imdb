Hi now, your real, TheatreX, found this while clearing through the flea market videos, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box, you saw that it was something of a "cool hit", so of course came it home with me. <br /> <br /> What a weird movie. Aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this dilapidated 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eye!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was over them at some point to live in the dirt and old Jackie himself came by putting things right. Anyway, this is a strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always carries something over her head and dances, sings and gives a little to the camera, which rarely makes sense. Big Edie (the mother, age 79) seems to be running around naked, and while we get hints about what it might look like, it was tastefully (?) Made to the point where we were mercifully spared it. These women speak and speak and speak, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make much sense, except for them. They live in absolute filth, cats do their business everywhere ("Look, the cat goes to the toilet behind my portrait!"), And a bedroom seems to be their center of operation. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Eie's voice, it reminds me a lot about my own late aunt who was from this area of ​​the country and had the Lawn Guyland accent. A scene has Little Edie running, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time, so the place must have been infected. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric" and I have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for "wacked out of their calories", but this movie is not without its moments when you really feel something for them. This is just as scary, sad and obnoxious, but I couldn't stop seeing when I started. This is not my "normal" type of flick, but I found it to be a bit fascinating. It won't be for everyone, guaranteed.
