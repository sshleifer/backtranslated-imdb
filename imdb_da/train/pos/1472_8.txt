Lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. <br /> <br /> Even if you haven't seen most of the movies or at least some other movies by the same directors mentioned in this document, you'll be a little lost. <br /> <br /> And the movie list is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) <br /> <br /> There are some Segway movies like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but these, I suppose, are bait. Surely Zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy the psychoanalysis (or if you have it), you get annoyed at no end. <br /> <br /> However, you should not, as a setting, cut, the way the film interlaces with these clips, Zizek's points are never boring.
