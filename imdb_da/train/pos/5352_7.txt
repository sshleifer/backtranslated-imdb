This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know, I've saved many of you the time it would have taken to read this review. If you don't like Arnold then you won't like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will most likely like it. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading this, I expect you to like Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, not he. The running man is a very typical Arnold feature. It has the usual retro future, we know so well from the 80's B-Sci Fi, it has a lot of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a nice heroine and a good ending. <br /> In this case, the evil opponent is the all-time 1984 government that uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. Of course Arnold ends up in one of these shows and turns it all upside down with a little help from his two confederates and the beautiful Amber. It is not a big budget movie, but still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere in the future, with some nice math paintings and set to help it. It's hopeless 80, but I find it charming. Works vary, Arnold makes his usual shallow and shouts things, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a little stereotypical, and the subtle named Lady Killian is a typical evil TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all that is lacking, the film shows its message very clearly; TV is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some futuristic digital video editing so the evil guys can change faces in a video to trick their audience. This does not seem to be futuristic at all today, which is a little alarming. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's movies before, then you know when to watch this movie. Enjoy.
