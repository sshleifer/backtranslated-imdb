There has been a lot of talk about "psychological westerns", but this is one of the few really in that genre. It has great name stars that work very well, but it is the director who makes this such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a crocheted retired buffalo hunter convicted in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the start (unlike the usual young startup, Taylor's character is also in the middle of the age) who wants to slaughter buffalo and entice Granger into business with him. They hire two other big name actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to be their rails. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he might be guilty of extinction, and knowing if they are being wiped out, the Indian lifestyle will suffer. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic sagism, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern films created by nerds and dorks. He is uncertain and needs human friendship. Yet he will not stop at murder. The end throws the two against each other with a striking conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well depicted.
