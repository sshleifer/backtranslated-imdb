Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art house with the artwork of the exciting and amazingly intelligent Cube, which is my personal favorite SF movie from the 90s. It hit the basic objection of a group of strangers caught in a labyrinthine shape like a huge cube, shot all in one set and took this idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I have been eagerly waiting for Natali's follow-up, and although it took five years for him to mount another project, I'm happy to say it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of a man's place in the world, and how through a logical event he finds himself in a situation outside his control. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the various roads it takes us down. It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF movie that has more than one idea in its head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the most colossal people ever to go on the planet, is recruited by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record various seminars. For their confusion, they are incredibly boring. Includes topics such as everyday shaving cream and cheese. While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he runs into Rita Foster (an effortless cast of Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice cream girl. She gives him the brush, but there is something for her that he finds irresistible. It is not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. <br /> <br /> When Rita arrives at another of Morgan's seminars, she tells him that his life is not what it sees out to. And I'm not saying anything more about the plot. If you want to do that, it would be cheaper to get the effect that the rest of the movie has on us, as well as the weakest road that is so fun to follow. As with Cube, Natali shows some talent to include seemingly ordinary people, takes them out of the familiar and basically sees what will happen when they are dragged into the unknown. And cypher follows similar patterns. But it's not a carbon copy of the Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy players and paranoia stories. One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into history without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his fake identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that separates Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is. Where Cube was limited to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a throw of unknown, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali economizes it as much as possible so that he can expand the horizon and launch Morgan on a fantastic journey through the maze of Their own identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's direction is unusual, with a handful of hands on the reins. There are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the DigiCorp building as a large and robust office block in conjunction with the insignificant mirror that Morgan is standing outside. All the color seems to have been blown out of the picture, which complements the tone of the movie perfectly as a modern film noir. The play is uniformly excellent throughout. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic character from his beloved marriage to question his own identity. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. He literally seems to change just before our eyes. From a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do everything possible to maintain his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett puts a welcome look that has made such an impact in the Cube. He lives in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed by men in black. His scene is one of the best because it is an exercise in carefully calculated excitement and paranoia. He is a presumably expert in identifying dual agents, and it's a great piece of writing, brilliantly traded by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan and we are drawn into his complex mind game. <br /> <br /> But it is Lucy Liu who is the stage performer here. Too often, she is thrown into movies, where her potential is not utilized to full effect. But in Cypher she finally gets a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is a secluded, protected femme fatale in which Liu is located. I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence the power of her ice-cold stare alone. Things come to a very gratifying end, it does not conclude on an ambiguous note how the Cube did. But Morgan deserves his good end. After he was put through the ring like this, I cheered for him in the last scene. It's a perfect last minute because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes. Cypher succeeds in every respect. Engaging, shocking, always entertaining, that's all that Total Recall would be, but not. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix. <br /> <br /> A nice follow-up from Natali. And now I'm a committed fan of the man. Excellent stuff!
