For Muslim women in West Africa, married life in the hands of violent husbands can be very difficult. Society must not explicitly adhere to such behavior, but they may not be ready to see it as a criminal, an attitude which, of course, makes it possible to continue. Fortunately, the letters of the Cameroon law promise equality to all, and this documentary follows real life exploits of various female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system as they seek to ensure justice for a number of women and children. The noteworthy (apart from the uplifting central story) is how, despite their informal nature, the courts are actually pragmatic progressive if a case is actually purchased. The program also provides a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroonian way of life, which (besides the horrific crimes committed in the selected cases) seems incredibly emotional and pleasing to what is enjoyed by residents of Europe or North America. And while I admit that this comment may betray naive√© from my side, this attitude seems to be caught in lovely pidgin English, they speak. All in all, this is a great little movie, and much more fun to see than you might imagine.
