I really enjoyed the reunion a lot! I would have rated it a 10 if they had had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even mention of where they are today or why they did not participate in the reunification. They were very popular characters, and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation for their lack of appearance. In any case, I was glad TNN ran the series again! I had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to lose the whole series (I may have missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
