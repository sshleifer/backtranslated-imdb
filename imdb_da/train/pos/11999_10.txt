I have seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me something about the actor who played the smith's wife - I'm not sure of her character's name. I went to BYU with her and lost contact with her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any info about her. She is not listed in the credits. This production was excellent, a tear button on all accounts, great performance by everyone. I suppose I will not even put it in the general category of "plays", more like "portraying feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this final dispensation" ..... something like. If someone worked with Kim or has a website or something, let me know !!! She was amazing in her role, by the way .... Thank you, Melissa Thorne
