It's a weekend I've been watching this funny movie. And I really like it. All the children are sweet, reminding me of my own childhood with the stupid thinking. It's a really entertaining movie for a group of families on the weekend, who could make lots of memories and laughter. Kid humor always works. good deals as well. simple story but cool shooting. Good job for director to find the baby's way. When it comes to the baby movie, I think of "12 and holding". another this year but deviating aspect to the child's world, which is genuine and cruel. great work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and family needs. P.S. Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo".
