I was also ready for the Toronto premiere. This movie was kind of comfort when I thought I couldn't come in to see my first choice. Well, I was completely blown away. When I got to the theater, I could remember a little bit more than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was right in it). Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days like Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I don't think since Chaplin has an actor who played so brilliantly without any lines whatsoever. The kids were also great. Check this out for sure if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I got to see my first choice - and it was much better.
