I saw the first thing as a child living in East London. The wounds of Hitler's Luftwaffe were far too obvious, and the film's landscape resembles our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing it. The odd thing is, it's really not dated if it is seen as a piece of social history in biography. <br /> <br /> Apart from a globally devastating war, the scope of the machine was very poor, more nano-technology now, but generally an excellent and well-done work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived then. I would think shooting a spacecraft from a giant gun would almost kill the astronauts. But much was right. Man's desire for war, but inhumanity to man. The military agent as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
