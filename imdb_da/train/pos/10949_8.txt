First of all, I would like to say that I am a great Sarah Silverman fan and to have other people say it and then the rag on the pilot over me. Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form, perhaps not directly fun, but the situation and delivery is what counts. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jesus is Magic then I don't see how you would like this. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. It is true, it is only for true fans, but if you are, you will be happy. <br /> <br /> Again, just for the true fans, there's no way around it. If you're not used to her style, then you wouldn't get why it's fun. It is, however, and I hope you also think about it.
