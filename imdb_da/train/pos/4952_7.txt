Reviewed September 12, 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theater VISA Screening Room. <br /> <br /> The basic plot implies that Morgan Freeman plays a once-in-a-lifetime actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who takes on roles that may be under him but which he still does with a positive attitude by knowing that he must pay the rent, etc. The downward slope is indicated by a long time between roles with previous flicks in negotiating DVD trays and his driver by a not too sure production assistant who lets Freeman off at a community market where he has to investigate for a role as supermarket boss. He soon discovers the real market run by an iron-wanted "10 Items or Less" checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's turn never returns, and Vega needs help preparing for an interview, the circumstances make them go together for a ride across town to get Freeman home and get Vega a job that gets her on one more mobile mobile career. <br /> <br /> While the movie was fun, it still seemed like a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other songs in the car, one that literally plays as a Paul Simon music video) that felt like padding to retrieve the time and even the movie was only about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's good, Morgan Freeman likes as much as he is, because without him it would have been too little. Sure it was fun in parts, and Paz Vega is also a pleasure, but there wasn't enough here to say it was a complete movie. They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car asking for directions and Paz Vega said she never did. Who ever heard of a guy who wants to ask for directions and the woman says no! In the real world, it is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay away from the credits. The piece with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to get busy sales is just fun! An early bit where Freeman's driver insists on that is Freeman's voice on a "Books on Tape" reading was also quite fun. <br /> <br /> The conductor / author Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a short Q&A after screening. Silberling answered a question that said the manuscript was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and when Freeman took the role, he actually changed very little of what was there. Completely compliment both Silberling's writing and also on how Freeman can just get into a role and make it feel like he was born to play it.
