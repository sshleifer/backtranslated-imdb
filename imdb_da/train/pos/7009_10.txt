I thought it was a wonderful movie. It touches all fibers of a human. The love of the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance to date. Great directing. Wanted editing. Music was great. Good use of flashback. It's the kind of movie everyone should see. I hope people get something wonderful out of this. Overall, excellent movies. I think Hollywood should do more movies with fabric. Even action movies can have a nursing story. I like Will to be very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest seeing this alone or with someone you really are interested in. For me, I found the world stopped and my only focus was on the movie. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a good feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. And with this me generation, it was great to see something (someone) that looked after other people more than themselves.
