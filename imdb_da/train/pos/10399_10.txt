This was a favorite in my childhood - I remember watching it on television and thrilling it every time. Now that I am an adult and have a child, I would introduce him to this classic movie. We saw it last Friday and he liked it. During Abu's struggle with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over and grabbed mine - he was really scared. "Should he beat the spider, Poppa?" Just see you want to see. He has no historical frame of reference to talk about (eight years) so Baghdad during the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid may as well be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he liked especially how much of the heroics and the offense were committed by the boy's thief, and not the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the film's story a little, the king's sidekick, not the hero at all, has to be very satisfying for imaginative, adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It's certainly a while - I suppose, since he is eleven or twelve, my son will find the "corny" or whatever the next generation will use for then. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the story requires it." Abu's willingness to put himself at risk (repeatedly) for the clueless, affectionate deposed king is just as unlikely. But in order to quibble on such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty feet of geniuses and the temple of the omniscient eye will be fiercely at the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled in the film's climax is enormous, as Abu's final shot triumphantly flies away on his (stolen) magic rug and seeks "fun and adventure in the end!"
