You sit there for half an hour and see a story, believe it all, then watch another half hour of the same story completely unraveling ... and then put it back together. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I don't know if - apart from Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans" - there has ever been something like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $." It describes, exposes, defends, reveals, and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost", the acclaimed and famed 2001 bestseller of honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is amazing and what makes the movie so unusual is that this "exposure" of Khouri is made with Khourio's full participation. <br /> <br /> For the first part of the film, Khouri presents her story of the supposed honor of killing a friend of her in Amman, the story of the book. She sounds completely credible, convincing. Then her story is taken apart, exposed to prominent and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative journalists there and in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the charges and tests a successful lie detector test. There is another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because it would reduce the shock value ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all but the main ones of the book's questions). <Br /> <br /> And the Houdini law continues, round after round in this powerful, seesaw prize game, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the form of decision. Brilliant.
