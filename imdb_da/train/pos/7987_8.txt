The man on fire was warm. I love a classic tale of good ol revenge, and what better cause of revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl. The authors did an excellent job in this film about building the relationship between Creasy Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning), so the viewer would understand and actually feel the driven Creasy had to save Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a cross-type who tried to save Pita through the "real" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. Some may say, "Torture is wrong regardless," and it may be you, but when you see the pain Creasy goes through because of the loss of Pita and the pure passion he has to get her back, you can Don't help but then with Creasy and draw for him to be even more relentless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the various imprisoned gangsters and criminals, and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's quest ended with Pitas back to his mother and Creasy who died in the bad guys vehicle. But Creasa's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, it actually reinforced it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job as the authors. This movie deserves good marks because it was definitely a good movie.
