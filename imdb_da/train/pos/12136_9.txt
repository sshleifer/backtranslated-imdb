Coming shortly before the introduction of a moral code, the spirit of darkened authors, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" titled countless movie guests. It has no shock value today, just fine acting. <br /> <br /> While casting is excellent, this is Bette David's first major role and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey, who cautiously and firmly states that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is not a substitute for true genius. He takes the lesson to heart, returns to London and enrolls in a medical school (incidentally, it seems to have no female students - at that time there would have been at least a couple. Perhaps the author / doctor Maugham does not care for distaff medicos) . <br /> <br /> With tea one day Carey is attracted to a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago. Her cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. His repeated attempt at her being met with the less than enthusiastic response, "I don't mind it", a sure sign of any man with his head straightened that he plumber the depths. Maugham's Mildred complemented her waitress's tips with a bit of old-fashioned street-walking, something that's not clearly brought here. <br /> <br /> Carey's dirty prostration serves Rogers' haughty need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her - she plays him as a Sunday church organist suddenly blemishes her instrument. No sex here. By acknowledging that he is going nowhere, he begins a coastal relationship with Norah, a woman who loves him. Go again Mildred, filled with a baby, and in his usual need to be taken care of. End heartbeat Norah. Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins with a long-term friendship with Sally, and she is enthusiastically attracted by her father who seems to see eternal marriage as both a good thing for the two youngsters and a chance to be relieved by one of his nine offspring . <br /> <br /> The movie reasonably, but not completely, follows Maugham's excellent novel. Howard's Carey is naive and vulnerable, and for much of the film, his sad eyes are reminiscent of one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun. Mildred is scary evil, a user of the worst kind, she is alone worried about her own needs, barely disguised when she tries to twist Carey with a thin patina of loving words (and offerings - at one time she promises she'll do "Something [he wants," a bold statement for the times and one I'm sure the audience fully understood. Pre-Code it can be, but Mildred's quick march resolution would have met the league for Catholic decency. The end is conventional sin losing, basically acting triumphs. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell performed excellent performances from his two star stars, a well-established, second-hand based largely because of this movie, the atmosphere being the 1930s London and the return journey in time is worth taking. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD 9/10 (for Davis and Howard's performances)
