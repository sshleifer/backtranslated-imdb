Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I've felt down in the dumps, and it's such a lovely little adventure. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent plays (especially De Niro, who's great). This movie made me happier than I have been for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very fun and smart movie. The scary joke of the kingdom's story of the prince's delusion and succession, the way of indulging in magic effects, the witch and dozens of clever little touches kept me all excited. It's a lot of what makes it so good; It is an elaborate film with special effects, with more history than most adventure films, but there is an incredible attention to small things. I just want to go ahead and see it all over again.
