My baby was sitting a fan, so I saw so many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the television when this show was premiered. To my surprise, I found it comfortable. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodges tomatoes from fans of the other * so I like that they only focus on the two. However, this can cause fans of the original show to hate it. I like the voice, especially Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me as if he really enjoys his job as an actor. I also get a kick out of techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act scenes from Star Wars (not called by these names in the show, of course).
