Although this movie has a premium roster of fine actors, excellent effects, excellent, and a storyline full of surprises, it was not downloaded for studio distribution and went directly to DVD. Perhaps it contains too much "anti-police" information, or perhaps it is too many action flicks released during a glut, but whatever the reason for the big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately, the new concept of publishing directly to DVD gives us the pleasure. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: rookie reporter reveals an inner circle of police that is corrupt - in this case the FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well-trained policeman created to clean up the mythical by Edison from his low point of crime, drugs, prostitution, etc. Working undercover is tempted to pocket the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity, and now 15 years after its formation FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorism of innocent people, etc. The main dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a scary real gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buff than normal and proving he can be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) captures the wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his fraud and corruption theory to his papyref Ashford (the always reliable fine Morgan Freeman). Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently fine character actor), and they help Pollack in this survey report. The closer Pollack comes to the truth, the more surprises and bad events happen, and the story runs counter to a number of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks charisma to carry the lead, especially in the company of such spicy actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling at the end. No, it's not a good movie, but it's one that creates an edge of sitting action girl with a message. Grady Harp
