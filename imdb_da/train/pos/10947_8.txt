The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's stand It is so over the top with prejudice that you may not be able to take it to heart. The fact is, however, that while most everyone will "get it", it does not mean that they will all appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you might as well give up there. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because all episodes so far have been as good as the last. Like all shows, however, it is not perfect. Personally, I love the program, but there are some big mistakes with it. Racist songs are fun, but getting older much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I also had with "Jesus is Magic". It seems that Silverman made a quota for songs per. Episode that doesn't have to exist. Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music is not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python, upright citizen brigade, etc., it's not something they show. I can see Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can't see more than half an hour at a time. It gets flat very quickly. The repetition value for this show is also low - the second time around an episode is pretty funny, and for the third time it's in my opinion boring. <br /> <br /> Still, the first time around is very, very fun. Give it a shot.
