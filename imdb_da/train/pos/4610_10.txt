On a winter day on December 28, 1986, two boring 14-year-olds hire a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "who is this Jackie Chan?", "Never heard of him". Two hours later after watching the movie, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and seriously out of pocket from collecting JC movies!) The movie still grabs me like no other. Okay, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my "first" (Cannonball Run doesn't count !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic JC elements, action, humor, action, heart and action! Some comments say it is dated, it was made in 1985, of course it is dated! But then also Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without film like Police Story where will Hollywood action be today? PS set standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies. To really appreciate it, you have to watch it on widescreen, you miss so much of the movie otherwise (yes, he really falls off the bus going around the corner!). If you haven't already seen this MOVIE NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
