If this movie only shows one thing, it is that Keaton is, was and always will be a comic book at heart, even when you throw bullets, go to the electric chair and come to the wrong end of an information line in the prison. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" continues to prove even more. In the 80s, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the highlight of the genre spoof world. But there were several preachers to the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") is trying Heckerling's hand with a great amount of TV writers behind the script (go and check). <br /> <br /> This slick-happy slapstick spoof from the 1930s cops-and-"gag" star movie throws almost every clich√© for a loop and even adds some cliches that didn't exist then. <And not only is the always reliable Keaton at hand like Johnny of the title, but also funny guys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and just about every other Hollywood actor who happened to go into the immediate vicinity. You will be surprised at how many faces you will recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start, they quickly and furiously come to you as a machine gun. There are too many to count in the beginning, topped with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you need to be careful when reloading. And they have to be reloaded a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody, they seem to have fun, and I laugh a lot of time. In the end, however, there was plenty of time to think about how some scenes might have been more fun - usually not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV, pop in "johnny" and be ready for something "dangerous" serious laugh. eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerously" ... not be a "bastidge".
