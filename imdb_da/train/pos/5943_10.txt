This movie is really cool. everything looks like it came out of the comic. the sets, costumes and plot are great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a little better at the end, but he still pulls it out. superman is also great. the flying effects are ok. But it's a fan movie so we can't expect them to be the biggest. The shot with superman to catch the car was very credible. it was great. This is a movie, I would definitely see if it was right. It has all the things you want in a Batman / Superman movie. one exception though, I would throw joker instead of 2-face ..... overall I give this movie a 10 because it's a good movie.
