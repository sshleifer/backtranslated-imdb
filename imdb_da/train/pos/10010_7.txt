There are many diseases born in the human mind that have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accrued information in the Pyschos kingdom has kept psychologists, counselors, and psychiatrists occupied enough to keep them for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who do not know their means or even their existence. It is the prerequisite for the movie titled "The Night Listner." It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings enchanting his audience with vivid stories of gay lifestyle. Perhaps it's because his show loses it's authentic veneer that gives rise to admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his girlfriend Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton), he is keen in his deepening despair and isolation. This is where a mysterious voice at night asks him for help. Noon should feel helpful and reach the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). When he reads the boy's scary manuscript depicting early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is imprisoned and will help. But things are not what they think, and dinner soon finds itself wrapped up in a heavy and bizarre tale torn straight out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and was not for Toni Collette, who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this can be comical. Instead, it may turn out to be one of Williams' more serious notions. ***
