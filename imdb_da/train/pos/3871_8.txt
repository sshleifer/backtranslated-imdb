Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in a crowded Jewish ghetto in 19th century England. She is surrounded by threatening, oppressive, dull, featureless, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, black windows and hordes of black and brown jackets. <br /> <br /> She lives in a small apartment with her large family running a clothing store in the apartment. As a child she did not work, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed, and was silent to ward off her mother and siblings who ridiculed her to mimic them out of boredom. As a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical haunting and lethargy and inertia, exudes an empty, featureless expression, is clad in clear and motionless clothing, and is constantly suppressed and dwarfed by the gray, earthly, massively impressive buildings and narrow streets, narrow aisles and narrow doorways and her high-spirited mother and siblings and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family. form of mental escape is the yiddish theater. Sitting in the balcony, the front row leaning on the rail, there is a large space between her mind and the stage, a space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and long. <br /> <br /> However, despite freedom of thought, the open stage for Esther, her face and body remain torpidly somnolent, monstrous, eerie. <br /> <br /> The common and ordinary look Summer Phoenix brings brilliantly Esther's emotional behavior - Summer / Esther does not pass any desire to want anything or expect anything. Finally, after an unusually explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther decides to break free from the gloomy life she's caught in. <br /> <br /> She's been thrown into smaller parts in a few scenes and meets Nathan Quellen, depicted by well-known British actor Ian Holm, who begins to learn Esther's technical skills in acting. From this point forward, Esther begins a grueling double journey to learn to act and learn to feel. <br /> <She begins to experience feelings she has never felt before, and she begins to gain the experience she needs to fully understand and exercise the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional stairs of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-sufficiency, etc. she begins to go through these emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths Nathan tells her - the truth about how a character responds, the truth about how the actor will react, and the truth a character and actor are not the same person. These technical steps and three truths slowly decronate Esther's defense and lead her to two constructive experiences in the film's sensation, marking the beginning of her thinking, movement and emotion. Esther Kahn is a technically challenging movie to watch because of its odd and clever camera shots, sharp photographic directions that convey Ghetto's realistic sharp attitude and Summer Phoenix's characterless and crisp and unpleasant depiction, brilliantly conveying Kar's mental and physical hut and dullness and lack of nature. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie for people who want to learn the technical craft and for people who appreciate minimalist film and character studies.
