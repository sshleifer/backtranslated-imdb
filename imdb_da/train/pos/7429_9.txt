She is such an extraordinary singer who cares about something else !!!! The last scene is one of the best moments in any show biz - bar none !! I'm glad she held the camera for herself for ten minutes - she deserves the iconic status - that's how the voice of the voice is. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie when I was five, and it had a big impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the errors (which Esther wants to leave Grammy's right when her prize is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other user comments are just plain fake - I mean where's the free nudity - maybe we saw different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's songwriter is monumental, and if she has a big ego - fine! <br /> <br /> She has earned it.
