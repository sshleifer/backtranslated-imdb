I had seen this movie back in the 80s and had almost forgotten it when I saw it was on TV again and watched it. I remembered seeing this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even better by other viewing. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as the twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for his elder brother at an unfortunate shot), are amazing . The film has a very real feel for it - a discreet, quiet and profound story of a family afflicted with grief. The dialogue is sparse but tells, and the non-verbal action is excellent. Kind of like a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People feel psychiatrists, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy involved in seeing it.
