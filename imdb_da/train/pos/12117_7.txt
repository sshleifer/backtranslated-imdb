Although this movie put Davis on the map because of her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate boy-snap waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this movie is oddly unsatisfactory for me as a whole. The action is actually fine in most respects. What I can't understand for life for me is how or why Phillip, a sensitive, well-behaved young man would take the constant abuse that this tramp constantly stands against him: I find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously incredible in some respects . Yes, I know he is a sensitive club, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who cultivates would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it credible. Davis is amazing in his role: Yes, she can go overboard in histrionics now and then, but it is a living creative depiction, any way you look at it. Too bad, she didn't play a gangster's minor. Her character would have been completely credible as a tramp among low-living creatures!
