Depardieus most infamous movie is this (1974) groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier. It contains many very sexual scenes that go on an X-rating, including one by Jeanne Moreau, who makes a warm 1970s version of her Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two hardy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware) . There is nothing like a sacred territory in this movie; everything is fair game. It is very strange that Americans tend not to like this movie much while many French people I have met consider it a classic. Something about it goes against which Americans are programmed to suffer. <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch-relaxing, hippy drifters with many sexual uncertainties, going around bullying women and committing small crimes. They are out for kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro-Commie, slacker 'freedom.' Being satirized hell out of these two guys, while bourgeois society itself looks much more ridiculous. Best of all, the way the amazing Stephane Grappelli score gives the restless soul of the drifts, the deeper subconscious consciousness or 'higher ideal' motivates all the bad emotions they involve.
