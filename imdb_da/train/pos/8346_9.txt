I just watched Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that everything is right with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart all the time from the opening with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin to him who lobsters Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a particularly unique situation for the 1950s where this movie is set. (I myself have been a teacher, but kept myself at home to raise my children, so please do not think I am a victim of women's liberals.) It is wonderful how a man who is "just a fat loss" finally seen as the same important and dignified as Catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no marks. There are so many small gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't look and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I caught a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene, where Ed Walters is going to speak at the symposium, there are 3 instruments (degrees, ruler, etc.) that hang to the right from the chalk frame. In the next camera shot only 2. In the credits on our video, it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti when he introduces himself to the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It can be a piece of fluff in some estimates, but has much more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that which large cast is mounted here. See it and enjoy it!
