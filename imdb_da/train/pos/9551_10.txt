I must say I was surprised at the quality of the movie. It was far better than expected. Scenario and plays are pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it's a decent movie in general. The idea was clearly brilliant, and the truth did not reveal itself at last. The mental hospital was given quite well. The reason was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it a little boring, but since the story is very focused and they take their time for character and history development. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre, and it's amazingly good.
