Of the elements that do this best at this time, I have to say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene poisoned and her reaction is truly magnificent. I imagine that as a poster suggested, Christine tried to laugh at that scene, but it actually made her seem even more gorgeous to be smiling at Shemp's dying. Another character that helps this stand out is Goon. His appearance was a good cross between horrible and comical goof balls. Hardly a sign I would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter. I would have preferred a little true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a card is this good, who is going to complain. Not me
