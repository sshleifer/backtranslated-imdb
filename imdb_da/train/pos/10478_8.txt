<br /> <br /> This is definitely a "must see" for those who occasionally smoke a reef in their secret hide-out, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, police etc. The protagonist is a lady in the fifties who live in her mansion, breed orchids, and completely unaware that her so-called rich and truthful man has actually gone and cheated on her. When he suddenly dies, she is confronted with the truth. The bailiff will pass by telling her that she is in a big debt. She does not know what to do before her gardener tells her about the latest success with marijuana in the UK. She decides after some long thoughts to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead ... The story is completely original, the excellent performances! I can think of just a few movies that made me laugh more than this one. Nevertheless, the melodramatic touch is present. The movie is typically British: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence involved. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few drafts before seeing 'Saving Grace'. It gets so much fun! Especially the stage with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is fun. I thought my jaws would break. 9.10
