This is a strange movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (really fake look) mummy out of a burrow and brings it home to study it. Well, soon she starts acting strange and talking to this mummy. And shortly afterwards, her son becomes obsessed with the mummy's spirit. Even foreign events take place as the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. This is actually really boring together, and it will make you fall asleep the first few times you try to see it. But if you keep it, you can just make it to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is Mama's Secret? Is the spirit of mummies angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to ascertain what spirit's motivation is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!), This will have some comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I've described the story is much clearer than the jumbled, boring way movies tell the story out. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... that way it achieves it. Perhaps this is a good movie at heart, but executed in a rather awkward way. I do not know. What I know is that I enjoyed it quite a bit despite its stupidity. Fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested in knowing that a few music tracks from that movie are used in this (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> With a scary and pretty well done sequence showing occupied rocks and rocks rolling around in themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. Other scenes in the movie are just spooky or quirky; But this scene is actually quite scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It's strange and it's worth your time. You may even have one on your shelf.
