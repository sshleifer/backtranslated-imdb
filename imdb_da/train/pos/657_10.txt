La Maman et la Putain should be seen as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and forever in many respects. It is true that the actors do not "act" ... they certainly speak a lot ... But what they are talking about is just what makes life worth living ... or die. The very long monologue spoken by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written about femininity, manhood and love. Not easy to translate exactly though. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
