I found 'Time At The Top' an entertaining and stimulating experience. The action, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film, of course aimed at the younger demographic, it is certainly one of the better works in the genre (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and 'Time At The Top' does nothing to discount this theory! I don't think continuity and great action are important to younger people. A good plot and an imaginative play are far more important to them. Both are in abundance in this movie. The special effects are good without disturbing the story or closing viewers from their own fantasies. It would have been very easy to inject an overload of SFX into this movie, but it would completely destroy its entire Raison D'etre. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this movie is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children or those trying to, like myself! Now I really need to read the original book as soon as possible.
