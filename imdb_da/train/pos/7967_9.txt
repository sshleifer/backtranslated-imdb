This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It is a real pleaser to anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will excite you. <br /> <br /> Basically, what Homeward Bound is all about is three pets sent to live on a farm while their owners are on vacation. They do not know what is going on and desperately want to go home, escape from the yard and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last movies Don Ameche starred in. He gave Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also the lead role in this film was Sally Field, who gave the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is about is chance! Spoken by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is just about anything you would expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I break up when I watch this movie is it because of Chance; It's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds of the times they have been alone or when they lose their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that always excites me is the scene where the trio tries to escape from the pound; I feel particularly shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar trapped in the fence and hardly does it. The film had other exciting moments, but none for me seems more exciting than the one. <br /> Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoy this movie, you'll probably also enjoy the sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
