This is a movie I saw when it first came out and which I have seen a few times several times over the years. It is always fun. <br /> <br /> One thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it spikes labor and capitalists equally. Only Sid works outside the classic battle, even though he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning: Do not read further if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, but presented fairly plausibly. Ask yourself: Can anyone support most of his or her weight in a single strict drug? It would cut through almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also, when it's the corner of an alley, Sid uses a trash can as a knight's shield. Sweet symbolism. <br /> <br /> Today I get it on DVD.
