This is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous movies out of the collection. It took me a long time to finally meet and get my hands on a copy of this infamous group of movies. I bought Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to see the collection in order after the release date. So I popped this sucker in and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I had read on the Internet and realized the content involved in this movie, I expected to test my nerves in full force. That was not the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hope of discovering the human breakpoint and how long a person can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a sick flick right? Wrong. The movie fails to shock. It may be because I've been desensitized over the years, making my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that a true gorehound could ease this. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, an individual who does not have good knowledge of this type of movie is likely to be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although I did not succeed in shocking me, the film contains some rather average spiritual and graphic scenes of violence. Included ripping out of nails, intestines thrown on an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. Generally, I believe in the majority of gorehounds on this board that you just need to get your hands on a copy of this movie for the news of it, but I suggest that for every new one come to this type of movie that you need to work your up to this one.
