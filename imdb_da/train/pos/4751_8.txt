I have no idea why this flick is so badly raped by so many IMDb users (some say it's his worst movie ever.) What doesn't any of you have seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is completely silly, and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. You h! What did you expect from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone believed in the story, and then read it out with action? Of course not! Black Mask is great, wall-to-wall action for almost the entire term. It's also terribly cruel, and we get lots of separate limbs, beheaders and creative ways to look at the evil people (and also a few innocent people!) Are slaughtered. Most of Lis's other martial arts films are preschool compared to Black Mask; There is no restraint on the free violence, bloodshed or action sequences at all! And that made me a happy camper. Again: If you go into a Jet Li movie that expects great dialogue and an exciting plot, you go for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movie (though watch out for the terrible dubbing).
