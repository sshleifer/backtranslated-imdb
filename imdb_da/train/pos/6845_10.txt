"Dressed to Kill" is probably one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It is exciting, stylish and extremely exciting mix of sex and violence. The play is pretty good, the orchestra track by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable, and there are lots of surprises to keep thriller fans fascinated. "Dressed to Kill" is a murder mystery involving a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine) and a high-cost girl (Nancy Allen). The murderer in the film is a transsexual named Bobbi, who is also one of Caines patients. The movie is full of amazing moments: the infamous elevator scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well.Highly recommended.
