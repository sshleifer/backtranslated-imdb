I watched this movie last night at a special cinema in Nuremberg, and it was great. I have to admit that the original music composition of the cell player and percussion / xylophone player has influenced the mood of the movie, but the film itself has power in its depiction of the tragic Nibelungen story. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in quiet movies or in the Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this movie. The costumes were amazing and creative, the sets were lavish and exotic, and the play was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent movies "tragedies") Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this movie duo that relates to Siegfried. The story of this second movie begins after the death of Siegfried when Kremhild begins to plan her revenge on her brothers. I also saw this movie in German; I am native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge. It was difficult to read the "subtitles" (what do you call it in silent movies?) First because of the old German script, so I recommend that if you see it in German, you will make sure you can differentiate your "k "," f's "and" s "in the old script. :)
