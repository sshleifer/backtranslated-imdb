It is expected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The expected toll is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 55 million deaths expected. In addition to the ugly statistics, personal stories that we rarely hear about are. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving near Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with youth. Although it is fictitious, it is about a situation which, unfortunately, is too common - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close family. <br /> <br /> When twenty-one Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, the family is destroyed. For the sake of their youth, they decide to detain the information from their youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he listens to the conversation and begins to succumb and act illegally. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and Marcel is sad but accepts. When he brings Marcel together to meet some former gay friends, tensions between them stretch to the surface and set the scene for an easier conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed that involve physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the amazing performances of Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales to his advantage . Watching events unfold from the young boy's perspective gives the film a authenticity that reminded me of Quebecoi's film Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that dance about AIDS's anxiety, Close to Leo tells a hard truth, but does it in a way that is tender and wonderfully real.
