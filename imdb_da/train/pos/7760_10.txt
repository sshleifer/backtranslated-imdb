Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, grandmother of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece that beautifully combines all elements of Sir's soaps and strategically places them all in a movie. "Written on the Wind" has very clearly influenced the 1980 series TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically a feature length version of the later night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, wonderful and subtle, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Not known to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family mansion in Texas, where we meet his white garbage man, a sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning tour). Yipee! Sparks start flying - from romance to catfights, this is a campy ride. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone as she can't have her only true love, which is Mitch. Kyle learns that he is impotent, but somehow Lucy gets a pregnancy. <br /> <br /> It's pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is completely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every way - the theme of the wind is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underutilized even though it receives top billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss apparently destroyed him. He meant this his finest performance and apparently no one was too happy to lose weight. And he turned out to be a fabulous performance as the roaring alcoholic. What a great movie! This film proves what I have been thinking for years - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? <br /> <br />
