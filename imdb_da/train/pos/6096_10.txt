I know technically it's not the biggest TV show ever, I think it was shot on video, and its limitations show both the sound and the visual aspect of it. The action can sometimes be a bit crumby. But I love this show so much. That scared hell out of me when it was first sent in 1988. Of course I would be 5 years old. But I recently bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear, have now been deleted. And I also heard warner is not going to release more because of the first DVD's bad sales. Also, the TV show did not have the same feeling as the movies, I actually thought it had a more vicious tone. although the color palette resembles nightmares on elm street 4 (both the movie and the television show was made the same year), this has more of a serious tone, while fims became gradually more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing, i like freddy as clown wise cracker.but i think it was the strength of this tv show, you did not freddy popping up every my out cracks a joke before and after he kills anyone. In fact, this has more of a dream feel to it, enhanced by the soft focus of the lens. I am not sure if it is conscious of the part of the shows that creates or just the limitations of being shot on video. I love this show and not taken as a companion to the movies can be very fun. Much better than anything on TV today.
