"Honor Men" - True Story of a Proud and Persistent Black Navy Diver (Fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely an amazing movie that both touches and entertaines and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Wonderful play is the main reason for making this movie a truly special and beautifully enjoyable, amazing experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as a rough, hard and indecent boss Billy Sunday - the role is practically written to him. This movie along with amazing "15 Minutes" (2001) are two of the latest evidence that he is still one of the most finest actors of our time. On the other hand, "Honor Men" includes a good performance from Cuba Gooding Jr., who has been one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz n hood". "Honor Men" goes directly into the company "Jerry Maguire", "As Good as It Is" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a talented and amazing actor and I am ready to get lots of more amazing movies from him. "Honor men" also have quite a large history and probably the most exciting diving sequences in film history. This is a fantastic, fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.
