First, I give my rating to the series overall; ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I've taken away three to downhill slide this series led after John Amos departure. Don't make me wrong, there were hard hit episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left a season and returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a very good sit-com (with dramatic overtones) presented at CBS. It was a television first, a show about an African-American family who lived in the Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude", he again struck the right chord with the viewers. <br /> <br /> Not since this show have I seen a situation of comedy direct talk about fighting in inner city families. (Now there was Fox's "South Central" in '94, but was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted like any father had to keep his family together and his children were walking down the wrong paths in life. Esther Rolle was a wonderful no-sense mother mother who was on the same side as her husband when it came to their children upbringing. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael is a young but very bright young man of his age but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the show's founder Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and is dealing with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghett. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young wise cracking, jiving kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough. Simply put, all of my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson history lines. <br /> <br /> After the outcome of James Evan's character, the show lost its stability and the viewers left. Esther Rolle left a whole year that didn't want to play the other enemy to JJ's smart aleck "Dyno Myth"! <br /> <br /> She returned next season after ensuring a guarantee that the author would do things herself. Florida's neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who ended up adopting a battered little girl Penny Gordon (played by a then 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's fierce mother was played by Totie Fields, Kim Fields' Mother. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the show ended with everyone who left the projects for a better life. The JJ artist had sold an idea for a cartoon company, Michael went out to live on campus in college. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma & soccer player Keith + Florida all moved into the same building in uptown Chicago. Not the most realistic end, but then it didn't matter.
