BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find" - although a rock fan for almost thirty years, I first saw the film a few days ago and ranked it among the best rock movies from all the time. The music is fantastic (T. Rex's cream) and the images are consistently exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer demanding Ringo Starr's previous management effort that did a good job here. If you love the music, you will be in T. Rextasy all the way, as Marc Bolan really is the star's piece, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a little: different places, costuming, musical events and bizarre visual concepts are all accustomed to borrowing different textures and very optimistic humor for what might have ended up as "only" a concert movie As rich and packed as BORN TO BOOGIE, the movie is only about an hour long, but what is there is quite satisfying, there is my only criticism - the video pack indicates something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims to film must be 67 minutes, but it seems more like 61 minutes of rocking fun.
