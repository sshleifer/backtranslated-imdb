This complicated story simply begins with an English journalist who accepts an effort by Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted Blackwood Castle. Once there, the author walks around the dusty rooms and corridors until music and a glimpse of a rolling couple leads him into a void. He sits at the harpsichord and starts playing the tune he has heard and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder of the amazingly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him with an ambiguous charming / creepy way that she has prepared her room upstairs and that one is always expected on this night ... the dead night. Thus begins an amazing series of supernatural events that confuse the journalist throughout the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: It won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a fun movie with absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky slot, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (though both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) The prolonged, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma as opposed to others you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
