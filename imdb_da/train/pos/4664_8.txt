"Hot Millions" is a wonderful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the amazing cast merged with it. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the play and appears as the key figure of a devotional immersion. The film, directed by Eric Till, does not show signs of being dated as horrible as some others from that period. In the middle of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, establishes the income tax forms for the guard who is amazed at the reimbursement he owes to the government. Marcus, a genius in numbers, sees opportunities where others would not. He is starting to work for a company that uses the latest computer for accounting, but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes various false accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is awarded a secretary who also happens to have an apartment in his building. The inappropriate Patty is seen as a busfield taker who manages to make a mess of everything. How she lands a job as a secretary is without understanding, but things are never the same in the office when the scary Willard Gnatpole decides to go after her but is not afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, a successful pianist and She is a flute and they make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Peter Ustinov. He understood clearly how Marcus was to be played and ran away with the film. Mr. Ustinov gives a secured account of the fraudster. The excellent Maggie Smith is also best with her at Patty, the friendly woman who loves Marcus and who turns out to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in Marcus pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as the American with responsibility for the company. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who wants Patty, but cannot make her reciprocate. The marvelous Robert Morley is seen as Emperor Smith whose identity Marcus has assumed. Cesar Romero also appears in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> The "Hot Millions" will delight anyone looking for a fun time in the company of the monstrous but charming character, Marcus Pendleton.
