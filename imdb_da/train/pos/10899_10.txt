I laughed so hard under this movie that my face hurt. Ben Affleck was funny and reminded me of a beautiful boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. The whole cast is fun, the story is quite good and the comic moments are amazing. I went into this movie not expecting much, so maybe that was why I was so surprised to get out of the girl thoroughly happy and the face exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness in the holidays and / or put up with relatives. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) was the subtle bits of humor that got me totally free of guard and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience had stopped. Namely, the scene that involves the Christmas tree lighting. Go see it and get a good laugh!
