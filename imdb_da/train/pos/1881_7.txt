As a drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man caught in childhood. As it turned out, the role of Moore fits so perfectly, it caught him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including the film's pale sequel), but it does not diminish the charm or appeal of this image, which is wisely written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced, parts of the movie are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much pleasure it is a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives the Oscar winner John Gielgud a blurry and dry funny role as Arthur's cop, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous report. Liza Minnelli (as a floral love interest) is sassy in a low key and Moore is brash, but skilled and lively; He never shook Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document of a career high to safeguard. *** from ****
