Some comments here on IMDb have resembled Dog Bite Dog for the classic Cat III movies from the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very scary, this movie from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really blurry, lurid or sensationalist enough to serve this comparison. But it still packs a punch that makes it worth looking at, especially if it's cruel, hard-cut action is your thing. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hitman who travels to Hong Kong to murder a judge's wife Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless policeman, determined to track him, regardless of the cost. When Wai closes in on her goal, Pang stops at nothing to secure his escape until he meets Yue, a beautiful illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape his life from abuse. <br /> <br /> A relentlessly tough drama with great filmography, great sound design, a ghost score and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as beginner Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hypervold (think along with Chan-wook Parks Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: everything happens regularly in this movie and is caught incompletely by Director Cheang. Of course, this is the kind of narrative that is destined to have an unhappy ending for everyone involved, and probably enough, almost everyone in this movie dies (rather scary deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedies and (unintentional) comedy, and in his last moments, Dog Bite crosses it: In a ridiculously over dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle, as a pregnant Yue is looking at. Eventually, after all three have suffered severe years during the fracture, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarea on (a now dead) Yue that delivers their baby moments before he himself dies. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not be a "classic" slice of Hong Kong's excess, with its deliriously OTT action and stylish images, it's still worth finding out.
