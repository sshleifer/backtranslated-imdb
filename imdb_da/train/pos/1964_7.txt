I cannot accept the negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema feeling happy that I hadn't been swayed by IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I still try to find fault in the plot, but I can't think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it for yourself and make your own mind. It follows a similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. It left me still wondering at the end, but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and carries her 48 years very well; this remains her defining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is not Michael Douglas. Of the support, I especially liked David Thewlis as a police specialist.
