This Wrestlemania just didn't do it for me. While some things, such as the kings' struggle and the involvement of celebrities, were a recall to the good old days, it seemed to be more of a highbrow "in your house" than anything else. Above average ... worth it for more matches such as. The roof's standoff match, although it is worth noting that the title change didn't matter when it was turned next night.
