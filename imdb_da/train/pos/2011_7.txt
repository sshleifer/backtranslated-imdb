If you've never seen this movie and like old veteran actors, this is the movie for you. Watch Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with the cheeked cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang some good old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) provided an outstanding performance with lots of dancing and musical songs. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played a major supportive role with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy as he did in his career. This is not a fantastic musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
