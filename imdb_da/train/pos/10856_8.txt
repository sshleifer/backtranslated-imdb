British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet, introspective, usually romantic study, and the Pharisa social satire. Settings, characters, and concepts vary, but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows in one of the two categories. Butterflies are perhaps the first type of epitome. The scripts are very verbal, including long inner monologues by the protagonist Ria, a basically happy but indefinite housewife curious about what she might have missed when she began a thoroughly conventional life. When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who is clearly interested in her), she plays with the idea of ​​finding out what the other way might have offered. <br /> <br /> The action and scripts are always on the money, making one's reaction to the show almost completely personal: I was also not blown away or turned off. On the other hand, my mother offered this show. I believe that the degree that one identifies with Rias dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's response to butterflies.
