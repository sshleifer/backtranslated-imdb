I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big cinema screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later in the summer of 1969, I was delighted to see that this movie was still playing at a prominent cinema at Leicester Square in London after winning the Academy Award for Best Picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> Good luck with "Oliver!" on both the stage and the screen reminded me that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, part of the English-language literary heritage, was admirably brought to the London scene by Lionel Bart of Britain. His charming musical then became a hit in New York and all over the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sentences and music tracks are insane. The song "Who will buy?" demanded hundreds of actors and the British film director really deserved his Oscar to put it together in a seamless way. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but it is especially a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios at Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years.
