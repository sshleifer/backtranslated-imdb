This movie is a different horror rhetoric. It's pretty good, but it could have used a little more. I compare it to "Doctor Terror's House of Horrors", even though the title fits this one. It has four stories that are all connected to a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife moving in. He creates a killer for his latest novel, and then he begins to see the killer roaming around in his house. This one is a kind of predictable, but it throws a few twists in the end. The next story is a little more unpredictable and you really don't know how obscure it is. This one has Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the pile. This guy buys the house, but it is not the house that takes the center, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story begins quite well and contains Christopher Lee. This one has him as a pretty bizarre father who seems very protective of his daughter. The problem is that when you know what's going on, the story doesn't end soon enough. It draws a little and leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final story relates to an actor who buys a cloak from a strange little store. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a little story about an officer who is seen all the time and is trying to figure out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I wasn't very happy with the explanation, I didn't think it really explained Cushing's story at all. I think they needed a bit more back story for one. All in all, it was an interesting set of stories.
