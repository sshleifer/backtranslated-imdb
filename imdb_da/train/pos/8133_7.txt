Well, I don't personally like rap, but I still found Fear of a Black Hat hilarious. I'm sure I didn't get any in jokes, but some I knew and it was fun enough to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Loss, so of course I had to check this out. It was derivative from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this film was still on its own as an original, intelligent and fun satire. My personal favorite: "Back at slave time, they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired for rebellion. Now we have hats."
