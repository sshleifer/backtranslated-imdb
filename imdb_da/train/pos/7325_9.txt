John Carpenter's Halloween is honestly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped psychic patient, Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to steal and kill a group of babysitters. <br /> <br /> This was the first and no doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great reluctance to pacify the story very slowly and build similar characters; unusual for a horror picture. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the lack of blood and doings, and yet it remains the scary Halloween to date. Take it! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a crucial point in the late Great Donald Pleasance career. A real classic.
