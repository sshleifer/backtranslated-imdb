Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master) made an entertaining non-stop action picture. This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with lots of dark humor too. This was one of the biggest hits in 1993. This is one of Harlin's best movies. Lithgow is a wonderful entertaining villain. Stallone certainly made a brief return of this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as the film maker. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35: 1) transfer and a fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.
