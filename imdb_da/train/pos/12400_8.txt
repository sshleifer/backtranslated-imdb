This is the second Animatrix card, and the first one is what you could call 'artistic'. It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a maturity of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human" or trying to draw against humanity for their "sins against machine". I don't think it's true; It only uses the robots to show us that we as humans do not particularly accept or open to anyone but ourselves. I would say it does a good job with it. The reason is good ... it plays as a historical document and tells what led to one of the greatest conflicts in the trilogy. Thus, it contains clips from fictitious news reports and the like. The voice effect is very good if there is not much of it. The animation is beautiful and the use of color, despite the usual realistic drawing mode, makes it more open to making the smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has several pieces of strong violence and disturbing images, as well as a little nudity. The disc has a comment, not in English but subtitle, and worth hearing / reading. There is also a well-designed and informative representation of both, so I would recommend seeing it after seeing the next one as well. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8.10
