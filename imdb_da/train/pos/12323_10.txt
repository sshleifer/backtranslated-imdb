This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen, and in my opinion much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The movie is a unique combination of several genres: It's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really does succeed in all this! <br /> <br /> This movie certainly makes it to my top 5 and should be fun for any movie lover. The action sequences have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying, but the way it is shot differs greatly from Hero's style, and the flying always looks good and usually also has meaning (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, you won't regret it. 10.10
