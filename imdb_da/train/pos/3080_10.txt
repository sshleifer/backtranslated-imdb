I've complained to ABC about canceling six degrees. If enough people do the same, it might be enough to bring this amazing show back to life !! Just go into the official site and the rest is simple enough. I do not understand why this show has been canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and character. The whole concept is poignant! I am amazed that my favorite program is over after just one series. Why is it? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV shows out there! Until I heard that they stopped it from a friend, it didn't even happen to me that this could happen.
