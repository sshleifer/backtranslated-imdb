Do you like really imaginative comedy or do you love "wedding scratches" if the answer is that the latter stops reading now. I can't believe this movie is no higher. Basically, Meadows plays a character that is not unlike Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From crudity - Leon play with himself on the porch, the former girlfriend wondered about eating. . Oh good. For inspired lunacy-clown sex, Broadway routine, voice over. Meadows are great as the childish, but very sweet natured Leon. Some good lines "don't blame wang" "freaky deaky sex world" for many. . . Why this movie was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy.
