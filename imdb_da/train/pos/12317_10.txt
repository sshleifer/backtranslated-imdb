A masterpiece of comedy, a fate, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about a Chinese ghost story, may be the special effects dated to modern technology. The movie has a simple premise: A bad debt collector must remain in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. It is of course also haunted. <br /> <br /> What I didn't expect the first time I saw this movie is that it's one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen; It's without losing any of the slapstick comedies that will get you stitched. Unlike some movies of Asian cinema, a Chinese ghost story is not hard to swallow for those who are not known in Chinese culture. In fact, it plays on timeless, culture-free themes in paranormal and romance. <br /> <br /> Think evil dead 2 if they had cast a wonderful love story into the mix. This movie is too real, despite being overlooked by many. It is definitely among the best I've ever seen. It is the ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of amazing. Highly recommended, 10/10.
