Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a crap load of children who don't look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunk night during a vacation in Vegas. They each come home to find out that their respective children are already familiar with the groom because of tabloid-like not so foot. They, Rob and Josie, both move them and their eight children in someone's house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, I think is close enough to Frank Lamberts (Patrick Duffy) construction work on the very similar step by step to justify eternal mockage. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of cookie-making queen, though it doesn't look like she's making any cookies. Not close enough to Carol Foster's (Suzanne Somers) hairdressing job to justify lying, but hilariously preposterous enough to justify evil mockery. <br /> <br /> Unlike step by step, they were a few before the holidays and actually knew another's surnames, or one assumes they are serious enough for a relationship to take a trip together. <br /> <br /> In any case, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should just have called the younger Andrew 'Andy'. There is a lot of product placement, especially for Soup at Hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid, pointless moments. It is also not a good movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> Hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review of 'Step by Step' on some really bad drugs. 'Look at Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes. There are some beautiful beautiful eyes shots.
