"Gandhi as a man and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story that few would have known for such details. Surely an insight into Gandhi's personal life. Overall, I liked the movie for history and movies. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah have all done a good job. Most scenes in the movie would be lovely desktop wallpapers ... commendable jobs. Traditional Indian folk music as a background score in some parts of the movie gives a good sense of the events. But what I didn't really like was the narrative style. On several points, I found the tone overramed. <br /> <br /> All in all good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8.10
