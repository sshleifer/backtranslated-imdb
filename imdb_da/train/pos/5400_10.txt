This film is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history set at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate lost a great fight against the loyalist who wanted the Emperor back on the throne to rule Japan. Really, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives a great performance like Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Human Slayer) of Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To get a good life, he becomes reluctant for Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke out of the Doom's sword). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of Hitokiri murder a lot of senior pro-West politicians to reach his political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go and drink and spend at his whore. Okada's killing becomes more and more brutal during the film, and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he comes. <br /> <br /> It is an excellent portrait of the life of a simple samurai caught in political affairs and really naive to realize what is happening. Only after being betrayed and tortured and always had conversations with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and views on life. But too late .... Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance. Each actor reaches their role. Sword - fighting a very unique and fast ... probably faster than more movies today ... <br /> <br /> Check it out if you have the chance !!!
