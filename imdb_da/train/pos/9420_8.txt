The Man in the White Suit is one of the great comedies that Ealing studies did so well in the 40s and 50s. The reason for this follows a man who discovers a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. Of course, this is a major breakthrough in the textile world. But things are not as simple as the cloth will threaten many people's lifestyles, including cloth manufacturers, the cloth factory's workforce and even an old lady who washes her every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film of scientific progress and the way they do not always help; As the old woman says at some point in the movie, "Why can't scientists just leave things alone?" Like many Ealing comedies, this is a stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a wonderful actor; He has the ability to turn on the screen with his presence (and he does in this movie, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a land and credible manner. He is appropriately scary in this movie, and he just captures the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious but somewhat naive researcher. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also has Joan Greenwood, the deeply voted actress who co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman movies. The action in the movie is not always good, but it is always decent and it fits the movie. The man in the white suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a movie that provokes the stomach laughing, so it is forgiven. I recommend this movie, basically to anyone who is a fan of movies.
