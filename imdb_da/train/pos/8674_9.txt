Tis is a very typical Tom and Jerry card - a situation is designed, conflict arises and chaos follows. The signs behave appropriately, the natural tensions between different signs lead to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace agreement is in force and respected - all kinds of weird wonders appear to your eyes. A word of warning - it's most unwise to let Tom help you do your morning cleansing routine! Highly recommended.
