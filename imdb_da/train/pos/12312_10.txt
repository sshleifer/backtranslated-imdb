Can't believe in a movie that can be made so good in 1987 and is almost unknown in the west. Don't repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moves. Literally it means "Dawn never comes" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look good. I enjoyed Joel in Old Gamblers and many movies by Leslie including Better Tomorrow.
