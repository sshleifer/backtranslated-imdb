No day goes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After looking at ice age, I felt that it was not so much impact on me as any other movie of this genre. But that's because I'm a big guy now, and I'm pretty sure this is a very fun movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the "actors" are fun in a sweet way, with no raw or complex humor. Even the "evil" is lovely, fluffy big cat with the funny teeth. And the story has a happy end, which was a little disappointment to me (knowing that most protagonists are doomed to extinction in a sad way), but a great thing for children. And apart from some fighting, no one dies (not even when he is stomped by a mammoth several times), which made a cartoon-like feeling. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, except for some really nice cartoon-like emotion scenes when you want to go in a nice painting or pages of a cartoon. [That still means a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There were some gags that made me smile - I accept that the creators were trying to please the adults - but they are hard to spot and (after my opinion) Better left unnoticed as it does not feel fit in the story. All in all, it's a good movie, but it's rather in the ideal world and fluffy-animal-for-children disney cliche. If you do not hate cute animals that do fun things, you should see it at least once.
