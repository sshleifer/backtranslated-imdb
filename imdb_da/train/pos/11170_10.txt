There's something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else. Perhaps I was a child, when I first saw it, made this experience so memorable. But as I watch it over and over, it never gets old, and I never get bored. From the opening orbiting the sinister opening song to the very chaotic end, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it continues to ring in your head: sometimes death is better! <br /> <br /> I don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns to point B (which is, believe me, completely end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, special effects are cool, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I wanted to be. As I said, it is sometimes dead better!
