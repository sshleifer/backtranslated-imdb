I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as entertaining as really good movies (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood patos), but they are often far better than the movies. And that's why I love Italian rip off cinema from the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has made some really great movies, like House on the Edge of the Park and also his Atlantis Interceptors and live like a cop, die like a man's funny action movie. But it's really bad. The barbarians are such an idiotic movie. Peter and David Paul as the barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and action skills. But if they can't act, they shout and scream every time they do something important. On a scene, people try to hang the barbarian brothers, and they avoid very extraordinary ways. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, poor direction, in fact, everything is bad in this movie. I can't describe how much I laughed when I first saw this. The barbarians & company are camp classic, everyone should see once. If you thought Plan 9 from outer space is a fun camp, it will be a real killer.
