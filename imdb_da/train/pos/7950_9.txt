First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this was only added to the movie's charm. The best aspect of the movie was the three animals, superlatively pronounced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather vicious otherwise engaging character (the voice of the reason), and Field adds white to a character that is always seen to tell Chance off. The people were not so engaging and sometimes pulled the movie, but that's my only complaint. This is a beautiful movie, with beautiful close shots from Canada I think. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a serious dull moment, and this is beneficial for voice and well-written script. All in all, a charming and perhaps underrated movie, with a 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.
