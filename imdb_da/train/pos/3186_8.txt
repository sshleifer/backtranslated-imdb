I find this movie very entertaining. The reason is simple and easily digestible, humor is light and clean, and because the story of erroneous identity is quite common, I look forward to how this movie meated this story. Turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female leader is admirable; her depiction of an innocent, naive girl trying to make some white lies to David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also find Vera's dance very, very well done. I find myself attracted to the toes as she told about the scene effortlessly and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who have had plenty of profanity-filled movies today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.
