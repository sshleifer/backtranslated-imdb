This anime was underestimated and still. Hardly the dorky kids movie that I noticed is still coming back to this 10 years after I first saw it. One of the better movies released. <br /> <br /> The animation, while not perfect, is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and the story is still so good today, even after I grew up and saw earthbreakers like the Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It has nowhere near the depth of course, but tries to see it from a light-haired view. It's a story to entertain, not to ask questions. <br /> <br /> Still one of my favorites, I also come back when I want to giggle on more light hearted animations. Not to say it's a childish movie that is surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
