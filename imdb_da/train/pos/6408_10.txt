A classic Hollywood Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both provide spectacularly good performances in the two leadership roles, and the support cast is uniformly outstanding, with performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "nit" I can choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance, which was fine, just because the movie seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate its role.) <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the characterization, the dynamics, and the impact of the real life story are nonsense and unforgettable. The development of the protagonists, and how what they experience, develops their beings, is uniquely characterized by the performing artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, pacing remains intact throughout. The score is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> We're a predictable Hollywood movie? You can believe that. So Mike Leigh's addicts have to pull a star, but everyone else should enjoy it.
