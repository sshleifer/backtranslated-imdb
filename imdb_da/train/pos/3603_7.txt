"Girlfight" is much more an upcoming age story than it is a battle flip. And what a relief to have in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and credible use of Brooklyn project settings. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that virtually every Hollywood high school movie is set in luxury suburbs or small towns. (Even the slightly comparable "Love and Basketball" that focused on teen-American Americans was put into suburbia.) While these children share some of the same peer problems, these problems fall in relation to the other battles of these children, where high school graduation May be the great accomplishment of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here rivets in its originality, holding your breath to see if she can have a relationship - and a victory - on her terms. A lot of audience members go to the guy who is challenged to rise to a situation of gender expectations. <br /> <br /> The film draws a little here and there, but it's no cheap tensions "Rocky" fighting movies, as practice and struggles have complex results, and all relationships - especially with fathers and father figures - take more center than center ring . <br /> <br /> There were many interesting music credits listed at the end, but I hadn't really noticed the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written 10/7/2000)
