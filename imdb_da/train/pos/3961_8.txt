This is magnum opus from the Swedish king, Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely has a film of this size been made in Sweden, and it really looks like one of the most amazing results in Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear researcher Markov will defect in Sweden. But his plans were destroyed by the Russian military who kidnapped him and told him that he had arrived in Sweden. This trickery is their way of seeing that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply of the whole planet. However, the CIA is bent on getting Markov to the west and sending their ninja to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of having Swedish actors speak English is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. The cheap b-movie that feels this creates is probably unsurpassed for performance. But beyond this? Now the action is standard direct to video style. Machine guns shoot huge smoke clouds. Thousands of Russians die. People run around in black ninja suits and try to hide in the snow. What really stands out is the insanely bad way in which the battle sequences are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect close combat. But there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie. And they are funny. It's so bad that I lack the words to describe it. If the ninjas moved slower, their hearts would stop. And of course, the whole movie ends in a bang, indicating a specially effective budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonald's coupon. So what is the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before has a film been made that is so clearly intended to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. It's the ultimate movie. Insert into video and laugh. You just have to realize that movies like these aren't made any more. This is movie history. Therefore, the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
