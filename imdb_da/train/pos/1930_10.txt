This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I have become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie and track it to film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I've seen it about half a dozen times now, and each time enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best movies coming out this year. At almost every festival it has screened, it has either sold out, or won the audience prize. Clearly, people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. The camera is great, the characterization and the actor brilliant, end up amazing, and the direction filled with compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It's hard to believe this is Ishai Setton's first movie. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
