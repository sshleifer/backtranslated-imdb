AMAZING ARTISTIC NOBODY CAN DO IT NOW I think. It seems to be perfect, the greatest and the greatest musical ever listened to the beautiful songs, it's pretty poetry. I am Italian and ADMIRED by American MUSICAL. Why can't you do something like that now? The Americans were the best and for that I absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie. There are words to describe the perfection of this movie. suddenly my heart sings what makes the sunset? I fall in love with light, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the largest without reservation. if you do not know your eyes are not open my friends you should see it and appreciate ... wake up!
