IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners of a company with ESTEVO (George Freire), but the first contracts a professional killer, ANISIO, to murder ESTEVO (the plot, at least in the beginning, t explain much well why). The guy does, and after receiving his money, he begins to deter the two partners who are in their company and says he wants a job there (like a tutor or something?). At the same time, he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVO, and starts dancing with her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, fraud and extortion go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can become the victim, exception to MARINA, the only one who does not know what going on and don't bet anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This sarcasm film depicts the sad and cruel reality that exists in big city such as SÃ£o Paulo, where crime is everyday presence. We can feel irony, but also truth in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who challenges those who paid him without any cries and even flirt with the daughter of the guy he killed! He must really be a monster to do such a thing, but of course I know there are people like him out there, in Brazil or somewhere else ?? <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie, cruel but truthful about a sad reality ?? The action is great and the soundtrack too.
