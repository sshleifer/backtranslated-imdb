A wonderful movie version of the best-selling book and smashing Broadway plays about Sadie's and Bessie Delany's life, two African American sisters, who both lived over 100 years and told their story of seeing a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, the white New York Times reporter whose article on the sisters launched the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present are very powerful, if not quite as inspiring as in the book. It is the only real drawback combined with the fact that some aspects of history are not clearly presented, such as the sister's mother's inter-racial background and why their father was so strict. But apart from that, a very well done, excellently executed, powerful movie.
