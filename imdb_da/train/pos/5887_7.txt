So Mary and Rhoda have the age - who doesn't? I was a teenager when Mary premiered and a "young adult" as it left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, perhaps the movie has not maintained the comedy in the original series, but there were enough moments reminiscent of the spirit of the series to make this an appropriate tribute. Example: The producer hiring Mary and dictating the idea of ​​a new series of "old people". Isn't it typical of the mentality of today's Hollywood TV and movie "Bean counters?" It may not be MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at best - but it's a beautiful damn good look back at one of the best shows we grew up in the 70s.
