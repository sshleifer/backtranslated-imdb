What a gem of a movie, so good that they made a sequel. The movie starts really well with an unpleasant monster who eats a few people and a party where the two main characters first put their eyes on Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a bit of an incline to whom this character is who has moved into the city and uses a realtor services to find him a house. Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The movie can be seen, but the actors' performances are a lot of wood and they seem like they won't be in this movie, but maybe it's just part of the decadent mood. <br /> <br /> Didn't like the end but there is a sequel to track it down. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I didn't really think Brendan Hughes on that part. Later I couldn't stop thinking about him, it kind of exudes a scary sensuality, so maybe he was right for that part. BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - the uprising of evil' as Lt. Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
