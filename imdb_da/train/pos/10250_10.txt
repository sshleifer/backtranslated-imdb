Guinea Pig: The devil's experiment is undoubtedly ***** stars on first view, it's a raw realistic scary and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie just goes to the point you can think of which point? The point is to satisfy the fan's only extreme violence and doings. This movie has something to do, more or less just torturing a woman tremendously. There are really only three scenes that could be considered as doing. I will tell you one thing about Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is hostile like Sesam Street. If you thought Hostile was a crazy, brutal disruptive torture girl, you won't see half of it until you've seen Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
