Not as bad a movie as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It has a good cast.Nice to watch Roger Moore back on the screen as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> Want to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Maybe staring opposite her cousin, the sexy Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of invisible places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> Hopefully, we see several UK-European co-productions like this one.
