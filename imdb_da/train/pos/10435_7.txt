My watch came a little late, but I'm glad I saw both this and the sequel together ... which makes me compliment the decision makers of this flick to give such a clean and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romance ... and very marginally separated it from the idea of ​​relationships! Since much has already been written about the film, it would just be advisable to highlight few parts of the movie that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think Jesse and Celine make false calls to their respective friends was a very sharp way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey that didn't even prolong 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people, both of whom believe the other has made an infallible impact on the other, has been very cleverly handled ... <br /> <br /> On the plot front it is not easy to Make a romantic story on pure conversation. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic flicks of such a taste, the characters are not clearly designed even in the mind of the author and director. What the actors get out of is what gets of them .. right or wrong, even the idea the carriers would find it hard to justify ... to become the character, the life the actor gives, goes beyond the instructions and the story .. Here both the actors do the right job! Kudos .. !!! and before sunset is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
