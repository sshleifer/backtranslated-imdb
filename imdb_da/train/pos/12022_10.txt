As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie as the plague when the bad reviews started eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it a really pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you're looking for a recovery of the original, you're in for a big disappointment, but if you're looking for something completely different, a little edgy and political, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Now, Gregory is thirty-four and works as a teacher at his old primary school, pursuing a teacher and having sexual dreams of one of his students. When the student insists on meeting with Gregory, a number of misadventures arise that include torture, breakage and onset and all kinds of unexpected phrases that left me feeling excited and moved. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something original, I highly recommend this movie. I just want more people to go to see this when it was released and seen it as it really is.
