I had fun watching Rødøje. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well-designed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with another setting, but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another scream with the usual college killer. It's good when you see a clean, coherent thriller, even though the originality doesn't stand out as the main character. Especially from a film producer like Craven, who has brought so many innovative ideas into thriller and horror genre in the past, and now just goes to bring home what could have been a good TV movie if it hadn't been released theater terms. Good work!
