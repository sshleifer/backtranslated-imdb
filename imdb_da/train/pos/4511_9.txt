I just downloaded the DVD release of this movie while I am on holiday in Norway, where it has been published with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and sharply acted. The young man who portrays the 'Frits' protagonist has an astonishingly open face that miraculously reflects the tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> Early in the film, we see that the father, who Frits loves so much has mental health problems, and it is brought up when the brutal principal refuses to attack the boy and suggests it was his own father. <br /> <br /> The climatic scene where Frits refuses to show respect for the principal; Simply standing and repeating 'Liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates, is a scene you probably will not forget. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the movie is the rather clich√© 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every "friendly teacher" trick in the book. Apart from this, I'm sure this is a movie you really want to enjoy.
