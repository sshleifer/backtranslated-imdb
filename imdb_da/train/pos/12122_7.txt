The movie can be great. I just saw it last night, but I don't feel able to give an honest opinion of it because I read the book first. The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the movie. If you plan to see "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains so much more than love affair Phillip has with Mildred, you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not make this claim easy. On average, I read a book every 4 days and read such diverse writers as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my voice as one of the ten best novels ever written.
