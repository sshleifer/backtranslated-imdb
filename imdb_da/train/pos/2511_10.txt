I was looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I didn't expect much from anything. A musician, an actor and a screenwriter? Not possible for so many talent to live in a person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and the characters are not lost in the typical hyped up Hollywood special effects. The story is plucked after your feelings and pulls you together. When the credits roll up, you suddenly realize that you were glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the function seems a little over the top. However, I think it is done with comic intention and very appropriate character. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level to behave. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or gas unexpectedly something I either missed or forgot the first time or two. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. Feel free to agree with your doubts, but I am sure it will find a place on your shelf.
