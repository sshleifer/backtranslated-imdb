"I didn't want this to be complicated, Leese. I must assume she'll read it." Fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this tight action thriller. An overnight flight to Miami soon becomes a blow to survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) is planning to use her as part of a chilling murder. As minutes, she ticks in a race against the time to warn the potential victims before it's too late. One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my best favorite actors. For example, the early stages of the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people keep running into each other .... I must also give it to the two to make a movie like this work. Especially Murphy's character. Jackson, who really seems to be so complicated in that he seems charming and innocent, but he tries to do his job and makes Lisa feel physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in some parts, he really seems to be concerned about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great thrill runs all the way. Many movies I would hate to see a prequel or a sequel on, but in fact I would not mind a prequel to this one, which would take place with Jackson monitoring Lisa. The favorite scene is probably the headbutt scene because it was so unexpected. There was also the good structure for the famous 'pen' scene. When should she get hold of her? There was also the lovely change in McAdams Lisa, where she changed from being a victim to fighting back. I also loved the scene where she is sitting in the dish and pretending to ask some ladies a survey on the dish. How big was Murphy with all his weighing .....
