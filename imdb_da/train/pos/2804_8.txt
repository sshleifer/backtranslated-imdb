The title of this movie almost enabled me to see it. Not being a Manchester United fan, the only mention of Beckham was a bit of putting, but I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie sped along with me, never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked East is East then you will love this movie. OK so the story is nothing new, and the classic storylines are included in the movie, but it is completely made fun and with fresh air. The film moves very fast and keeps the audition entertained. The occaisional fun moments are a good chuckle and not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
