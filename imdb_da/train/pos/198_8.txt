Oh, it's so cool to see a quiet classic once in a while! Director Vidor is simply lovely and even makes a long (at least in 1928) cameo like himself. The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" study. She becomes a great star and the consequences she is truly alien from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (bad) past! The cameos are simply fun, definitely the scene where the protagonist (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that she doesn't seem so special ... It must be one of the first movie-in-the- movies here and for real freaks it is great to watch the cameras and the material from the way back then. A must-see if you ask me !!
