To all the miserable people who have done everything from complaining about the dialogue, the budget, this and that .... who will hear it? IF you missed the point in this incalculable movie, it's your loss. The rest of us, who deeply love this movie, don't care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in his own unit in my book. It should not be a documentary or an actual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever tried. I know it's the cynical 90s, and the millennium has everyone in dizziness, but come back. Someone on this comment board complained that it made too much money! How hard is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the best-selling movie in the world. I would like to sit with the majority this time. Okay, cynics, time to climb back under your rock, I'm done.
