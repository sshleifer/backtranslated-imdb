The legendary Boris Karloff ended his famous career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico. This is the token moody period gothic thrill feed from the pile. Karloff gives a typical spear and worthy performance like Matthias Morteval, an older eccentric patriarch, inviting several of his petty, greedy and reluctant non-relative relatives to his eerie rundown castle for reading a will. Almost soon, the hateful guests are hit by lethal lifestyle toy people who populate the place. The only Mexican gender symbol Andres Garcia from the "Tintorera" infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks completely confident as the only sympathetic female character. The lumpy, plodding (non) direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, leached cinematography, ridiculous murder sets (a gross fat slob blastes right in the face of a miniature cannon!), Overwhelmed string score, morbid bleak-deaf Atmosphere, basically lousy plays (Karloff exceptionally excepted), cheesy mild gore, bad doubling and fiery fiery conclusion all lend this cozy horrible lemon a definite endearingly cruddy and hence strangely fun ratty charm. A real campy hoot.
