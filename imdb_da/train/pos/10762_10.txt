I was one of many who expected to see a glorified, Yankee doodle dandy depiction of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were right in the middle of it, and the returned pictures are both amazing and heartbreaking. And yet it all went on one chance trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers gather a documentary on life as a new firefighter, especially from a young rookie perspective coming up the line. In the beginning we see much of this recording, just to remind you that there was no intention of making a film about terrorism. This was supposed to be a film about ordinary people who serve an honest life that helps others, and the beauty of the movie is that it never loses that edge. <br /> <br /> While examining a suspected gas line (I think my memory is a little unclear about it), we suddenly hear a plane flying overhead. The camera pans to reveal a commercial beam that torpedoes into one of the towers. What should the cameraman think about now? By recognizing the importance of the images the camera stays on and possibly realizing the same, the FDNY allows the camera to follow them into the building. <br /> <br /> The following is a true front-line image. We see FDNY's commitment, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of one of the buildings from within, while another camera captures the events from outside. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the horrible event they covered, the footage alone would be a possible young doco-maker's dream. The recordings simply deserve to be preserved at all times. But what really sets this film apart is the real humanity that it brings to the viewer. We see that firefighters run without hesitation, people of different races help each other escape the wave of rubble and even the filmmakers' concern for each other (they are brothers), as they cannot reach each other in the confusion. There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this movie, something Hollywood could never duplicate (though it tries). 9/11 is not a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst we are capable of. 9/11 is simply one of the most important movies I've ever seen, and would be the only movie to be born from this event if it was up to me. You cannot duplicate this.
