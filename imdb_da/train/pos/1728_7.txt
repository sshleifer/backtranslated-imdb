The wooden horse was one of the first "big" World War II escapes, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie but had to it on VHS from Amazon in England and get it transferred from PAL format in the United States. I read the book when I was in high school after watching part of the movie in the early 60s on television. escaping from Germany during the war is more realistic than the trait of the escapees depicted in the Great Escape. This movie is a lost treasure that needs to be made more accessible to American audiences.
