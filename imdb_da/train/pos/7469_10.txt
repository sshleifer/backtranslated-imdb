This movie was just absolutely brilliant. It actually made me think. Throughout the movie I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenominal, and no one could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites this year ... it deserves an ocar.
