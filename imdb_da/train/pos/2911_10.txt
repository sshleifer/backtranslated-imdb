This is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. I grew up as All My Lovin 'was brand new, and hearing it again today by the original artist is a goal of Sir P Mc's power to spell any crowd of any age. This doc goes far behind the scenes to show us life on the road, not just for the band, but all down the roadies. I saw this guy live in Aussie 1975 and can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than he gave nearly 30 years ago. I have a large 5.1 surround sound system that does this justice and will recommend this particular a Beatles fan. This is the closest you get to a Beatles concert today. Songs, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and keep the audience in hand. If you want to record perfect music, buy a studio-recorded CD. If you want to hear raw music as it is meant for and spontaneous to the audience, with all the excitement and feeling of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
