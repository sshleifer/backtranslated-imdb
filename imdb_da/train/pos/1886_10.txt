I've loved this movie ever since it was debuted in 1981! I have wasted how many times I've seen it! It never fails me to make me laugh or encourage me if I feel down. The three leaders are amazing, and the manuscript is invaluable, plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing of the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I know pretty much the whole script, so when someone sees it for the first time, I have to hold back and say something about how much fun the next line is. I can't even narrow it down even though Sir John's character certainly gets the most memorable. The famous "I want to warn the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still invaluable, but the list is really endless. The scene is with Arthur, who soon becomes the fiance's house, a scream, especially his interaction with the moose. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
