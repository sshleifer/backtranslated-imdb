... but I still enjoyed this show. I have read some of the comments that previous reviewers have had to say about this show and I find it difficult to completely abrogate all criticisms in my own head (except one: the show was outdated; this program was something but stale). A lot of the things people are questioning about this show is on the money: pretentious; forced; overstrained; desperate for attention; complacent; annoying everlasting tale. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, it really really TRIED; and it made up for all the minuses. The show was bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know it was only once a week I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. I will make sure to pass. But I suppose no one will bring this back to life.
