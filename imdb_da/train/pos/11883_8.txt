I watched this movie a week ago and keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the signs very credible and sympathetic almost to a fault. As in fact, disappointing sometimes, as was the case with Leo, who although I liked his character, I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex, even though he was fully aware of his HIV status . I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are in young gay men. This is by no means intended as bash homosexuals (I am gay) and movies might well have been made about a young straightforward person making poor choices and ignoring the consequences for themselves and others. The only part of the movie I couldn't understand was why the family (gay) was unwilling to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point that he couldn't go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think The biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is NOT UNLIMITED SEX!
