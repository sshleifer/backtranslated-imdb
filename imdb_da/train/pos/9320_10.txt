A MGM MINIATURE Short Subject. The editor of Cole County Clarion must decide what is the right IMPORTANT NEWS for its readers: an impending frost that can spell disaster for their crops or the sensational shooting of an infamous gangster on their main city main street. <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable little one-reel, with a good performance of the Charles `Chic 'Sale comic book. Today's viewers may be more interested in the look of uncredited James Stewart, as Sale's nephew / assistant. Slowly talking and a little deaf, Stewart shows many of the attributes that would make him a big star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, the short and short strands were useful to the Studios as important training places for new or emerging talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was quite different from a movie of its own length, something like writing a topnotch card story rather than a novel. Economically producing in terms of both budget and schedule and able to depict a wide range of materials, short motifs were the perfect complement to the study's feature film.
