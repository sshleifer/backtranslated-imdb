I've seen this movie on Sky Cinema a long time ago. I have to admit it was a really good Western that contains 2 of the big names. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, who plays the infamous and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other hand. The late James Coburn plays the villainous Zach Provo .. seek revenge on Burgade, no matter what the cost is ..! The good thing about this movie was that there were some really good characters. . Most of the actors played it really well. Especially James Coburn, who I find out he really meant in this movie. But that was the way it was. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who I 'have seen anywhere in other movies. Player Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character had been left out in the cold, but he managed to get in again by merging with Burgade to bring Provo's posse's! <br /> All in all, it was a good movie. Very good to see .. Fantastic score from the late Jerry Goldsmith .. Wonderful piece of western persona ..! 8 out of 10
