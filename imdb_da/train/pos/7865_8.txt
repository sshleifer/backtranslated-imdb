Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once in the whole movie did I find myself staring into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, although I think someone with more glamor or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a good job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the film together. Boman Irani did a good job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie HISTORY it is amazing and very realistic, it doesn't turn around in the bush, it's very straight forward to send its message. I think that more movies like this have to be made, I'm sorry to see the same candy floss movies over and over again, they become difficult to digest now. Everyone should see on page 3, it's a good movie. Just my 2 cents :)
