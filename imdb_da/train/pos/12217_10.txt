I went to see Ashura as the 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. The man, it was a beautiful kick. The director was to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons he is still in Japan ... oh gentleman, I hope he gets better and does lots of other movies. <br /> <br /> The reason is pretty simple but somewhat original ... the demons roaming in Edo in Japan and the swordsmen called "Demon Wardens" beat them and fear rebirth of Ashura, the demon woman who sleeps and allegedly is very kick- ass. /> <br /> It brings us to Izumo ... a kind of elite sword called "Demon Slayer" and his buddy Jaku, who is the typical violent jealous asshole ...? Seems boring? Now it thickens. <br /> <br /> Izumo took his pension from killing demons when he hit a young child "impressively" that he was the demon, he never knew, but he killed her. So Izumo continued with his life and regained himself in kabuki theater. In a boat swaying on a lovely evening, Izumo shows a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes her life and restarts to kill demons ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and the enemy ... the guy knows how to handle a sword and draw an entertaining massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo carries the film as far as playing goes ... he's the total package ... he knows how to fight (hell yes he knows), he's witty, he's intelligent, and he has that pig. You never have to shout: "NO IZUMO, IT IS A TRAP" The guy already knows, he has common sense. He really is the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> What aesthetics is, the aesthetics are quite interesting. It is by far the movie that looks most like a manga. It's cream full of special effects and nothing at all costs prevents this movie from looking realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Lots of colors are an "unreal" photograph, except that ... it's pretty straightforward ... but as I said, the protagonist wears the movie A must see, a masterpiece of masterful hands
