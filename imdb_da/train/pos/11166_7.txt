George Raft like Steve Brodie, the carefree, dancing gambler who can never deny, is pitted against the lumbering, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A soft touch for every panhandler adopts Connor's impulsive waifs and strays, especially runaway orphan "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an out-of-town innocent with aspirations to become an author. <br /> <br /> In this man-dominated culture, communication is mostly in the form of violence (see why BOWERY is a Martin Scorsese favorite). Exploding cigars provide a continuous gag. "Swipes" enjoy throwing stones through windows in Chinatown, on an occasion putting a laundry out. (The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie and Bey's volunteer fire companies leads to a fight where the building burns to the ground.) Unfortunately, Beery relaxes a troublesome girl and enters anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, as he defeats a night-time fist fight on a moored barge, to regain control of his salon, lost on a bet that Brodie would not have the courage to jump out of the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie does the crotch, but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last minute.) <br/> <br /> As usual, the Walsh fills the frame with details illustrating the approximation of the fillet's daily life; song servants, bullying the barmen, whores from the suicide hall being hustled in the black Maria, tailors collaring unhappy hicks from the street and forcing them to buy suits they do not want. A smaller but admirable little film.
