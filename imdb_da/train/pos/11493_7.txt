The unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie that exploits the fears of pregnancy. It works very well by the always good Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen, even though it supports caste is pretty average for a b-degree. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's script is quite intelligent for this kind of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. Rodman Fender's direction is only sufficient, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. If you are a fan of Adams whose movie career is not as near as brilliant as it should be, check it out; she is good as always.
