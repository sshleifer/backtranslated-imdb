From the 1990 movie of the Austen film, this is my favorite, more than "persuasion", which was the one that converted me to Austeniana. Before I saw this "Emma", I had seen two previous versions, but in all, Emma seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the second she seemed half wrong as a possible cheat, whereas she seemed just right, young and stupid and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novels very well; It is actually one of the sweetest, most powerful things I've ever seen, rather in the form of a Christmas present. The script is exceptionally well-formed, and the adapter's additions, such as the shaft of light, which reveal Harriet to Emma in the church, are consistent. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I enjoyed him a lot: he strongly brings the common, practical side of the character, unlike Emma's influence, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr Woodhouse a figure of almost carroll absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's protégé is as soft and exactly as firm as she should be. And, as in the same producers' "Pride and Prejudice", it is taken into account that the possible links of characters can be believed - unique in some cases. For me, this production was and remains a joy.
