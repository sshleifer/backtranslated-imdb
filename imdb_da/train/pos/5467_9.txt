In my opinion, this should be one of Barbara Stanwck's best performances. She was one of only a handful of actors, since and now who could say more with a single look than a whole page of dialogue. And I was fortunate enough to watch the original and uncensored movies with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who hardly agrees to work for her father in her illegal speakeasy. Her only link to something is her good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African American (and having a white woman being best friends with a black woman back in her 30s was just as controversial as the subject of this movie), and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women are stuck or pushed into a situation without their control. After Lily's father dies and she doesn't know what she wants to do, she is told she has the power to get out and get what she wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. So "they" had to go and destroy the last few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and worth seeing. "Lesson" of the movie is still as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure it will be 100 years ago. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, notes.
