I watched this movie once as a kid in the late-late-show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took 30+ years, but I recently found it on DVD - it wasn't cheap either - in a catalog specializing in war movies. We saw it last night for the first time. The sound was good, but it was grainy and had the trailers between the wheels. Still, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed with how true it was to the doctor. <br /> <br /> The catalog is around a place here. If you are sincere in finding it, fire me a missive and I will see if I can get you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
