I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every episode. I remember when I used to sit at. 18 each night and waiting for it to arrive at Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to descend. The best series should be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). Then the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school, it didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old "sparkle", but the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and attentive, but when her aunt has gone and Sabrina moves Getting into their house is just not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not true, and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh, the show just doesn't show right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all, I still love to see the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Witch, but I think the authors took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after the show certainly lost some of the magic
