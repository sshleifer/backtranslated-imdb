"That '70s Show" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. I started to see it in two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw what I could tell it was a good show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a great character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's fun. It's classic when Fez goes "your son of a bitch!" And when Kelso shouts "burn!" It always makes me laugh. They are both good characters and always have something fun to say. Jackie's hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started to be really nice but awful, somewhere around the season 5-6 she really got really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there's still fun. This is one of the few shows I can see again and again and still laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it. Cast is classic; Almost everyone is fun, where with many shows there are only a few fun characters. I will be sorry to see this show end next year, but it will be out of the air as one of the best shows ever.
