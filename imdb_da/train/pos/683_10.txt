I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. Now I see many of them. As a special efx has an ever-greater grip on today's movies, sometimes to find a real gem, turn the clock back to the time when the authors and directors really needed to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this very rare pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story is called "The New House" one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972 ... I was only 9, but nothing since then even compared to that. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, one should do this "as is" with no more special efx than the original. This episode was down right scary as hell. I'm lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories to get close to were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". Want someone to do more ghost stories like these.
