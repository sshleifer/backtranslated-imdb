The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​them adapting to the island, while mysteries were explored (and seen) was just phenomenal; filled with excitement, tons of cliffhangers and a fantastic plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of ​​just seeing them get used to the island. And so first I saw the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on I was connected. The second season was just level with the 1st season, slightly better. I absolutely loved the idea of ​​the hatches and the DHARMA initiative. The whole plot and sequences in season 2 were mysterious, eerie and exciting. I loved all the exciting surroundings, others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 fantastic. Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I loved seeing the stories of other stories, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, but not so good, was still breathtaking and fun, but mostly exciting! Now the 4th season. I had hoped this season, and the first couple of episodes we are good, but then it really started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot grew old after the first few episodes ... and most of all .... Season 4 was removed from something that made LAST a perfect series: Mysticism, excitement, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and general thrill. There are also some of my favorite characters left.
