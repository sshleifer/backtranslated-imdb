FBI's story, as said from Agent Stewart's point of view via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as Hamilton is a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of history makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies, as we catch a glimpse of who threw the gangster. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school sequence). All in all, it goes too long. Nevertheless, it is worth looking for its beautiful production values.
