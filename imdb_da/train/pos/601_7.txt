I was surprised at the low rating this movie got from viewers. I saw it on a late night on television, and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Still, I can remember it well, with a good twist or two and an interesting mood on a wind farm. Michael Pollard looks appropriately seedy for his role, which basically summarizes the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it right ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, though some of the themes that might have seemed a little edgy in 1989 can now seem tame, which is a shame, given that modern "edginess" is often only used as a necessary marketing tool. kind of like clamoring just to be noticed.
