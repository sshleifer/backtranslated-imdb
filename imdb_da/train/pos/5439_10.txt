It is, of course, a film that has had a great influence not only on the buddy genre but also on action genre. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick, as so much of his Star Wars series looks like a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just the precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffes Gunga Your morphed in C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes him or not: Jar Jar Binks. Today, this movie is seen as a non-PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian resistance to the British raj that could be repeated in many people's feelings today. <br /> <br /> For a young boy, it was a great movie. Three strong male leads and only a touch of romance. There was a time when young boys thought kissing the girl on Saturday matinee movie was just mush. Not like today, when more skin is greeted with joy. Too late to complain about lost innocence. Hopefully this movie will not be forgotten, and a couple who are channel surfing will stop at TCM and catch a movie with action, adventure and a throw of thousands instead of CGI actors.
