"Most of us reside at least two worlds, the real world, where we are gracious to the circumstances and the world in the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape." With these words, Mr Gone introduces into the world of "The Maxx" a fascinating world where the imagination and reality are combined. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comics, "The Maxx" is very much faith in the material of what it was inspired, not only in the story but also in the graphic style that resembles the comics pages, giving this show a surreal and unique look. But the story is also interesting and entertaining. At the moment it may be too strange, but when you get into it, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music fits perfectly with the show's style and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this one was short lived. "Maxx" is a must see. It's one of my all-time favorites.
