"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be among my top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialogue and action are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna introduced into the movie does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to get to all places in just one night, either (especially if you are a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But it's not the intention. The relationship between the two characters is much more important, and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although nothing ever really happens, the film never gets boring. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or anything. Even if you don't like love stories, watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical of the sequel that will be released this summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
