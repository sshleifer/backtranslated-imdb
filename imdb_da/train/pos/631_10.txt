This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, wise witticisms, great plays and a fair dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel, which I am now reading) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking things for me was actually the self-history. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy films out there right now that leave openings, and so this was a pure adventure that satisfactorily in itself without the need for a sequel. Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.
