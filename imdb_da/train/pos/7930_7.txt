I'll be honest. I got this movie so I could have fun with it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction can I have? The case, however, is that the film (and its decision makers) decided that it should not be fun. Instead, it would do its best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It came terribly dense. Slightly less cheese in random music, a little more professionalism in photography, the play, the cases (like the props - love the Best Buy bag) ... it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty nice little movie alone. And acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than I would have expected. There is even a decent sense of humor when two of our leads discuss how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you overlook the low budget (leaving its total fingerprints) almost constant profanity, this can be a pretty fun time in the cinema. No that is not good. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, the actors, the crew all tried to make a good movie (instead of a camp classic), and it counts a lot. The line of campy zombie film is a mile long and thank you guys for not adding it. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the Quiroz brothers. I'd like to see what they're doing next time. And hi, someone, give them a budget!
