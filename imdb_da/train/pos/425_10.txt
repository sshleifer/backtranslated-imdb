I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my favorites all the time because my dad, Nelson Malone plays horse trainer. I remember clearly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we lived at that time to make April Love. My father had been in many games and was a talented man. I talked him in to try one of the bit pieces offered and see he came home with the script. How exciting it is! There were also a number of my classmates in the actors - especially those shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I watch the movie again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still playing on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a long time away when you watch the movies they make today with all sex, eerie language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies as April Love comes back in focus ...
