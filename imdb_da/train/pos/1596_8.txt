Although Cher and Cage are the focal point of this story, Gardenia and Dukaki are good counterparts to them - this is where Loretta and Ronny will be 50 years old - still in love. The whole cast does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Even though I saw it a long time ago, I am glad it was finally catapulted to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to scenes in the opera to the kitchen table arguments - this is a very entertaining movie.
