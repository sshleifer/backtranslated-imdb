McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The reason is told in flashback mode and it relates to an otherwise normal and happy family of three through a very bizarre problem. I can't say much more without pampering the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to see it, you are at least surprised. <br /> <br /> All the major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of correcting these children, and his acting is amazing. McConaughey's play is solid throughout and fits perfectly with the beetle. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Is Dad Crazy? Is there a God? Are there demons? How far will you go right wrong. And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of the films that deserve and reward a second or even third view.
