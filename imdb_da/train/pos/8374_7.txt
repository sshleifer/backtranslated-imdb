OK, this movie was cool. I don't think it was the best movie ever made, but it was probably fun. My brother and I are still performing scenes once in a while and will occasionally cut the film out of the closet, blow the dust and pop it in. Enjoy until the end, but a good concept. This is a movie you just have to forget about criticism and just enjoy. The verdict is victory for Robot Jox.
