I lived Rawlins when this movie was made and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see everyone behind the stage, from the barbedwire, who lived up to the electric chair up through the workshop's office floor. It was also fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate, which was cut into the prison wall for the film, was and still is called "Disney Gate" by the locals. If anyone is interested and ever in Rawlins, most of the movie sets are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was great fun to work with and for R. Harlin and wanted me to have a chance to do it again.
