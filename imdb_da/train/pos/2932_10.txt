I have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies, but this one is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you always walked past it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty straightforward jokes, but it's just fun to pass. If only every movie could be so fun. it must be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this movie and makes you say "that is the guy who did Dr. Doulittle!" He talks about the ice-maker, the shoe's mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism and anything else you might think of and those you couldn't. Please if you ever see a comedy in your life then it is if only all movies could be Delirious.
