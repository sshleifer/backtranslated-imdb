I'm one of those people who would crawl a mile through broken glass to watch a Hal Hartley movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my Hartley favorite) NOT HOW, HAL's unique brand of film is a taken over taste. Infusion of equal parts mystery / espionage with spiked comedy seems to be his forte. The comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often runs through a whole scene before it comes to fruition. And that's the case with FAY GRIM, the successor to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey stars like Fay Grim, left wife of Henry Fool and mother of Henry's only son Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many Henry Fool notebooks, and they were all previously thought to contain nothing but crazy walks. Apparently, there is much more to them. Secrets of weapons research or roads to terrorists? Who only knows Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but it's quickly surprised to get Fay out of her home and search for Henry (and it works ... but not the way they think). <br /> <br /> Fay is struggling with several spies to collect Henry's notebooks and seek him. She also makes an appointment with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of prison (he had helped Henry escape from the land in the original Henry Fool movie.) Several overlapping events occur in quick succession: spy shoots shoot each other To death, Henry is discovered to be held in "security" by a jihadist, Fay frees his brother, but unknowingly risks his son's life, and the CIA gets its way to jeopardize Fay. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley obviously loves to play with themes. And so he does so extremely here. Even character names (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have implicit attributes that are quite funny. The over-the-top espionage movies of ol 'also get plenty of screen time, as guns blow in stop-motion sequences, never beating our heroine even though she's right in the fire. <br /> <br /> Now that I have praised this creation, I would say that Parker Posey's exaggerated depiction of Fay Grim is not the best part of the movie, which is a shame considering how much time she is on the screen . I realize it was enough, Mr. Hartley wanted: An eerie woman with hand gestures to the Italian extreme. But it was still painful to see at times. <br /> <br /> Although fans will probably devour Fay Grim and ask for more. Although this was not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
