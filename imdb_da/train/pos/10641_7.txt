This dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun dys hard throwback action flick, it won't win any awards and it's not that original but it delivers the items you'd like to see from a dolph lundgren movie. our man dolph is a former soldier who is now learning a hard inner city high school and when it is taken over by terrorists, it is up to him to save the day. Sure the script won't win any Oscars it's fun and it has its fair share eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance, but he comes alive in action scenes, and the rest of the cast is not the best actors, but they keep it good. All in all, the detention is an enjoyable act, but you have seen it a million times before.
