This is bar no the most fun movie I've ever seen. Beginning with the four crimes sent by their fathers to the Wienberg Military Academy, is a tone that continues all the time through this goofball movie and it doesn't go up for a second. It is difficult to try to describe this movie; Humor elements are so immaculate and brilliantly admitted that at first appearance it seems like nothing more than a stupid 80's teenage comedy. But it's so much more than that! Fresh from these people's minds over MAD Magazine, Up the Academy serves a formula and style that I have never seen copied by ANY of the "funniest" offers to get out of Hollywood this year before. Basically, the movie is so full of infant ball material that you might guess the authors were a couple of 14-year-olds themselves. Watch this movie if you love to act "immature". A classic. *****
