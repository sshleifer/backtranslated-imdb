Having seen several episodes of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any originality. Here is an old science fiction standby, brilliant wrapped in the form of a genuine original concept - and yet they can only - for the most part - make it work. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is good! The male actors are reasonably skilled in their profession. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos for the hero and his more than sympathetic side kick. And most of the episode's plots come across as tasteful. So what could be wrong? What about the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actresses chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on depicting the female characters in this - almost good series in a way that makes the end product a misplaced cheerleader. Why do I ask why? <br /> <br /> The sections fall completely flat when the female guest star or recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are all amazing in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them knowing they are not able to act their duties. A blind person could tell. Just listen to them talk. They deliver their dialogue with all the dramas and effects of a 16-year-old in high school. Who do these women think are PhD scientists, senators, corporate executives and doctors? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if the producers have their choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers from it. Too bad!
