"The Fourth Man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers in the eighties. This last work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films like "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned writer (Jeroen Krabbe) goes to the sea to recover. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a deadly love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three former men all died with mysterious circumstances ... "The Fourth Man" is greatly influenced by the old Hollywood movie noire and psycho thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells . It takes a lot of time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact on pushing the story straight ahead. The excitement is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Cast is also excellent, especially Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the doors to his international film career ("The Living Daylights", "The Fugitive"). If you get the opportunity to see this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, don't miss it!
