I really miss the production of good old-fashioned Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were commissioned to produce such a movie, it may have been this, with the exception of the lack of an internationally known top player. This is one of the movies you see alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even have trouble making up for the morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, authors Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, top production design by Jon Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph and an excellent cast to make me shake and feel so isolated even though I live in one of those most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave it a "9" out of "10" because, with television production and budget constraints, they really attracted a great show.
