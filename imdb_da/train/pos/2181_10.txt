<br /> <br /> Artistic shot, actors depict their role precisely. You get a real sense of seeing Lucienne rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to win for tragedy again. All in all, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And can very well say that the Prix De Beute '(Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is a great favorite in my silent movie collection. Louise Brook's expressiveness is perfect, and I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty combined with a tragic story.
