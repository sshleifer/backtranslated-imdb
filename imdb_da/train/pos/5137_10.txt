Interesting, fast and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of the people watching lots and lots of TV. I stumbled upon this show while I was at home ill with a bad case of flu one day and was immediately joined. I've developed a lot of crush on John Burke. Both he and Claire did a fantastic job of hosting the show together. You could really tell they both loved their jobs. <br /> <br /> The super collector segments were excellent. I was interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I really want to know is: What happened to Jack the dog? Has one of the hosts adopted him?
