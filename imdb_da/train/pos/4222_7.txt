I like this episode, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little hammy as she always was. As said, the music is very good and it has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a large plot hole, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It has been determined that the light does not work in the vault. Don't you think the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the bulb was working? You would think in pretty short order they would have screwed the bulb and then found the note. Permitted is the TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems too sharp. It doesn't really make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the "deathbed" testimony goes on incompletely, apparently for days.
