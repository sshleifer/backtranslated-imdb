After seeing "Guinea Pig", there are two issues in mind (besides "Am I really a psychopath to see it?"): "Is it a snuff?" The answer is no; Even though it's the closest thing to a snus movie I've ever seen. And then, 'Where the hell did they find that girl?' Because she is tortured for 45 minutes, without any justification (in fact there is nothing else in this movie!): Fingernails are torn off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infected by maggots, ... and many more until the final scene ( I'm still not sure how they did it). Because it belongs to the 'underground underground scene', it is obvious that she didn't get much money. So what was her motivation? <br /> <br /> I saw it in japonese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogs, the boys just disturb her in a few scenes). I haven't seen the entire serial number yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. Still, I have rated 8, because if the purpose was to get people to believe this a snuff, the question is pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, as they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
