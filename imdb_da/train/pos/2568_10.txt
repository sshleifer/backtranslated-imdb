In this sequel to the 1989 action comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time along with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner a middle Doberman called Zues, who doesn't come along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley also does not come with his new partner. It all changes as the film goes together. The movie is intense as their is a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes dealing with Dooley's wife who don't really seem to be in the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, doggy jokes, fix jokes and jokes about dogs that bite evil in a particular area . I know that it seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big James Belushi fan and the other is for the action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than he was in K-9 and the action sequences are also better. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you will love this movie.
