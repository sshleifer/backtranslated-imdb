This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit the exact place that Bulimia really is about and how it is not always about being thin and dieting. It showed how people with bulimia tend to think of things like their views on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is, is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It showed that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of something that has to do with others. It only has to do with them and them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem rather than paying attention to themselves. It showed that Beth needed to call attention at that moment, and she needed her mother's attention at that time most.
