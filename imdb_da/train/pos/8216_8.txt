*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two difficult excursions ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have restored his step in "Sudden Impact", a gripping thriller who wisely plays to its strengths: Clint Eastwood's charisma, which also instructed, and a story that spends only enough time for exhibition and reserves energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For once, Harry's case outside his native San Francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics) to the village of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler), a group of lowlifes is miserably murdered one at a time by a woman they beat raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in catatonic status since the attack. /> <br /> The murderer is portrayed by Sondra Locke and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold blood. Locke's cold eyes and frostless voice, either trying to comfort their hospital admitted sister or dispensing revenge on the rapes, are very effective at painting a portrait of a woman who is wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit . The Rapists are a despicable party, especially the leader who has "psycho nutjob" virtually stamped on the forehead and a lesbian who seems almost one of the boys, despite his anatomical inability to participate. The feedback scenes, although not graphically explicit, are nightmare enough and are clearly intended to cheer the audience to Jennifer when she kills her attackers. Some will reject "sudden consequences" as the trash can: a thoughtless, manipulative revenge story. At a certain level it is true, but it is well done garbage bin. What works in the film's favor is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gesture or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a viewpoint. You can take or leave the idea that some disadvantages deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind slayings becomes clear to Harry (a cognition that is spelled out with dialogue), he gets one choice - what to do with a killer whose motivation he can sympathize with, but whose behavior he is bound by the law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare. <br /> <br /> The second redeeming quality of the movie is Eastwood's direction. This is a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The movie is aimed at style and white and is edited to give the action scenes a big payout. Some of the best "Harry Moments" in the whole series are here, including Harry's most famous line, "Go ahead - make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a film that is discouraged by its beliefs by presenting a tale of a contemptible crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. And that is certainly never boring. On these criteria, it succeeds tremendously.
