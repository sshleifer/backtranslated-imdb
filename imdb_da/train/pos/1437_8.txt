We often see films about unwanted things in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino stars as New York's mayor, which has to do with shooting a boy. But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. In this movie, the cartoonists are as cruel as we would expect from everyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a particular politician, you may have doubts about seeing this movie. I understand that I cannot mention any specific example of something similar to what this film depicts, but that is not the point. If we had the idealistic impression of them at the top, this movie beats down such ideas. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
