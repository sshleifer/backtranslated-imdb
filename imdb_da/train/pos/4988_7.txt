The Man's Castle is located in one of the Jerry-built settlements of vacant land and parks, which in these times was called 'Hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31th President, who got stuck with the Great Depression that occurred in his administration. The suggestion for this movie is that a man's home is still his castle, even though it is just a shack in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a cabin and the truth being told this guy even in good times wouldn't work that much. But in a part that is very typical of Tracy before being cast as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a lot of classic roles, he plays a hard, good natural mug that takes in Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things about Man's Slot is that it shows the effects of depression on women as well as men. Women had some extra strain on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed, and some made themselves into prostitution only for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who is facing these kinds of problems and makes no demands on her in her castle. Almost soon, even if they are in love, even though Tracy is not that kind of settling down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had some extra zing for them because Tracy and Young had a disturbed affair under the cloud's shootings on the human castle. And both were Catholic and married and these days it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took Catholic faith quite seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast is Walter Connolly as a sort of grandfather for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who has been through all the pitfalls Young can meet and tries to control her clearly and Arthur Hohl, a truly abominable creep who also have an eye on Young. Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through his twilight. <br /> <br /> The man's slot is blatantly looking at the great depression, not the usual movie-escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
