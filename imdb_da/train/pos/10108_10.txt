An absolute classic !! The direction is flawless, the play is just amazing. The words are short for this great work. The most final movie on the Mumbai Police. This movie has been the times. <br /> <br /> About Puri gives a great performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done their best, and the movie ran on you every moment. This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to think about many problems that confront our society. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a policeman (About Puri) starting in his career as an honest man, but eventually degenerating into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about the Mumbai police. Kudos to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this movie, a lot of Bollywood movies were released that exposed the criminal politician policeman. Thus, this film was really a trend set. This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate box office hit. <br /> <br /> A must-see for discerning movie fans.
