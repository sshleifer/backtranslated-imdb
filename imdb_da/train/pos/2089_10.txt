"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore. There are many major disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short according to today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good at the moment. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role. She basically has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and heartbroken. The Asian and Asian actors' performances are amazing. <br /> <br />
