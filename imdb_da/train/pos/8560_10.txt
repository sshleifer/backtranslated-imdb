Drew Barrymore was excellent in this movie. This role is the type of role you normally don't see Drew play. Her typical role is like a woman seeking love. The story is also great. When Holly is involved in her mother's murder, she goes to L.A. She goes into a guy who becomes her lover. But her brother, who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder, is almost killed, she is mistakenly accused. It is so obvious to her that she has several personality disorders. Then another woman becomes paranoid when she is around her. Eventually they find out the truth.
