This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village best described by stage constellations and direction of ancient Kurosawa works combined with Dostoyevsky's subjects of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and HC Andersen's tragic and cheerfulness. The play is wonderful, the scenes are colored - and beautiful scenes remain truly embossed in my mind. The reason is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action, so if you don't like all feelings, you will also come to you -. It is not about the mysterious Geishas and the proud Samurai with their Bushido pouring all out of them, but about life, work and kind of people found everywhere at any time. A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.
