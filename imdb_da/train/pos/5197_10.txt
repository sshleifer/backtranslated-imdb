This movie ran all around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie great ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldn't do it alone and you know! LOL) I admit I killed my first video tape of this movie and I'm planning to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has so many captivating lines it is pitiful! I am embarrassed to say that I know the theme song backwards and forwards! I love the death of Jimmy Lynch, and he should have won the best supporting actress award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscar was never ready for this! This is a random movie consisting of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (Being the 70s, and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and displayed one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters!
