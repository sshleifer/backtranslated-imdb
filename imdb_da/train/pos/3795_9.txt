After watching this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay presented a subsequent discussion about the film, which presented its ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film depicting minorities (women, non-whites) working to solve controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, race identity, single-mother households) and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics as a mid-thirties white man. The multi-sports, multi-sex audience of mostly adults told the movie's amazing story, detailed characters and a fantastic depiction of "real teen life". However, most teenagers had left the building - which makes me think it's a movie that is best seen by adults with children as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults who felt "should a movie teenager see because it is about them. "Therefore, distribution issues - how do we get the hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a movie that is being buried, like "Buds" or other radical modern teenage films - and McKay seemed responsive. Regarding his credits as a writer / instructor, McKay was more sensitive and detailed in his work - as he addresses the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film is set, and works with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they believes should be - with the results disarmingly realistic.
