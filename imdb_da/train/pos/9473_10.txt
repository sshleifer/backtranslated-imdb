I was fortunate enough to see this on a foreclosure last night (October 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and really heart felt. <br /> <br /> Though the plot is not very complicated or untrustworthy, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinctly "indy" in style. It is not something that can easily be compared to the previous film of the past. It is a unique tag on a kind of classic middle-aged depressed love story. <br /> <br /> I was especially hit by the movie's casting. Down to every extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly spread between them and none of them "shaded" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a nice movie to suit all ages and laughs a lot of fun while being really touching and heartwarming. It was a wonderful break from sex jokes and nudity of recent movies.
