I LOVED it and was so crushed that there is no other season !!! I wish they would! it was the best show ever !!!!!! There is probably no chance that they decide not to cancel the show there! ha ha i wish there was however! I would be so so excited !! I really wanted! I miss it! and was especially crushed for not knowing what was happening with Jason !! I think they should do another .... I also think it is stupid that you have to write ten lines to write a comment. It makes your comment draw on .. and no one will read it !! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole ... maybe they could get a spin off !!
