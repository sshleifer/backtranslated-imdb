This movie has a special way of telling the story. At first, I found it a little odd as it ran through time, and I had no idea what was happening. <br /> <br /> No matter how the story was, even though it was simple but still very real and touching. You met a person the first time you fell in love completely, but finally hit up and promoted a deadly pain. Who hasn't reviewed this? But we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am quite concerned, as two actors have shown great achievement in showing the love between the characters. I just wanted the story to be a happy end.
