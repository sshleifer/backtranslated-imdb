In her first nonaquatic role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher who is the victim of sexual assault. She gives a good performance, showing that she could be very effective out of the pool. As a detective to solve the case, George Nader might give his best performance. And he is so beautiful it hurts! John Saxon is the student under suspicion, and although he receives impressive billing in the credits, it is Edward Andrews as his convincing father who is on display. Bathed in glorious Technicolor, the illegal moment is irresistible hokum and sometimes convincing drama.
