Maybe not the most original way to tell a story, we've seen all this before in many movies .. but .. I liked the October Sky alot anyway. It got something great instructor and well functioning by all parts, especially Laura Dern (the teacher) and Chris Cooper (the father). I want to be a rocket engineer! :)
