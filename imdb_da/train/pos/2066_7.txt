It is easy to forget that the series later developed the alien conspiracy plot more that The X-Files wrote occasionally episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry" where foreigners were not all small gray men "Fearful Symmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant somehow transformed into space and time, not a mile away from "The Walk" - and ending with a pregnant gorilla abducted. And it's a lot of an episode of wonderful moments. The subplot is annoyingly worthy - yes, we get it, zoos are bad except when they aren't - but the ideas that are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable within it, cover an angle of the largely overlooked - why * would * people be the only things that foreigners are interested in? In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it was fun to watch while it lasted, very memorable, and essentially it is something you could not imagine many other shows do.
