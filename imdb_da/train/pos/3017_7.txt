Philo Vance had many affinities with Bulldog Drummond ?? He was a gentleman with the kind of Polish and elegance that was only associated with the British upper classes, and he was also independent wealthy? <br /> <br /> But there were important differences ?? Drummond was an adventurer, charming, gallant, lively ?? Vance could be pompous, small and boring and self-righteous ?? There was a hint of basic cruelty in his way? <br /> <br /> "The Kennel Murder Case" is the most impressive of the 14 Vance movies made between 1929 and 1947 ?? The story of a murdered collector of Chinoiserie, it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery ?? exotic setting in the blue nose Long Island Kennel Club, three killings for Vance to solve with an enchanting "locked room murder", the key to the whole affair and lots of suspects ?? <br /> <br /> Normally, a detective story has set itself static and talkative to make convincing movies, even though they work well on the printed page, but here Michael Curtiz's direction and fine-tuning gives the film a pace and urgency that makes it quite different from similar films of its type? <br /> <br /> William Powell's elegance and suavity made him the perfect Vance, and even though he changed studios a year later, he remained in the same genre with the hugely successful and popular "The Thin Man" at MGM?
