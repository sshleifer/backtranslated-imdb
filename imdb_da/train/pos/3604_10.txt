I think it is a good movie. because you see how Diana's life is at home. She got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I am also boxing. It really impressed me. the only negative part i think. Is the end. because it's okay between diana and adrian But you don't see how it is at home. And I didn't really like that, you also don't see how her father does, and her brother. but i think it was a great movie, and i think i'll see it much more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you don't like boxing, you will see much more than boxing only. I was happy to see it.
