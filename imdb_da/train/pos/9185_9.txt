DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a huge surprise. It features excellent action (especially from the underrated Callan), fine filmography and a compelling story. In other words, it is one of the finest horror efforts coming from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models at a time when he reunites with his psychologically fleeting brother (who accidentally lacks an arm and a leg). When the models Callan dream of killing actually gets dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own hygiene ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie never got the rose it deserves. Most critics and film players clump it in with the horde of slasher movies released at the same time, but it stands high above most of the evil party. It is wise and unique, which is not something you can tell about most movies in this genre, but it is also passionately designed and executed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind.
