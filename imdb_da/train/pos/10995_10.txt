I watched this movie at theater when it first came out a few years ago and really liked it a lot. But I still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good for movies coming out now and I will tell it is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life! !!!!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you do not need to miss a minute of this movie, if you do not fully follow the action, you will get lost and you do not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good you can't expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the manufacturer!
