Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets his "Hi sister" !!!. This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and comes to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not turn up and leave Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns to the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job and shelter in an elderly home. Slow romance blooms and Soha goes in to marry Abhay. Then resume Shyan Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A sensitive movie with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, is about the delicate Soha. This well-made movie has moments that remain forever etched in one's memory ?? the awkward first kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class wali ladki" and quickly adds "he doesn't love her"; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date. The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes & surrounds Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. The silence transmits both the disturbance and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The sharp end ends in a bitter sweet movie, where memories are resting for a long time. <br /> <br /> A must see I will rate it 8.5 / 10
