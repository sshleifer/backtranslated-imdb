Yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of dead dragon / world-warring / sacred crap action movie fan. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from my standpoint this movie had some of the best acts sencer was pretty dang good. But it is that kind of movie that everything just fell harder at the right time, or just when evil was trump, something came in to save them at the right time. Although there were some fun lines and gangs in the whole movie that surprised me. The 3D graphics were pretty wrong. I mean for this kind of movie, the 3d effects were great !!!! The big battle that was shown in trailers lives up to the hype the movie had. The fight between good and bad at the end was, I must say, could have been longer and a little better, it was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Now on the parts that I think could have been better. The beginning was pretty good, showing the parts that led to the big battles. I mean, if you don't really want to watch this movie in theaters, then at least it's a dvder ... overall I loved the movie, but the plot just fell in place too quickly and fits harder just for good.
