Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Don't expect the production values ​​of a theatrical release, but expect the highest quality directly for video release. It is created when Timon & Pumba begins to see the original Lion King in a dark theater and changes shift tracks and begins to tell their own story. This is done by frequent comic interruptions. For example, during a certain tense moment, a home shopping appears commercially, and a chagrined Pumba realizes he has put on the remote. These little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not, it will greatly depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly bothered by movies that are consciously reminiscent of, the viewer sees a movie than it might not be your cup of tea. Animation is the best they have invested in the Disney DTV line and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material. The newer independent material uses much of the original artistic style. The voice talents are all well done, though I couldn't help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be recognized by the viewers as being recycled over generations, but are presented more with the knowledge of old friends' pleasant quirks than annoying repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature. The toe-opening function of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and fun. Timon and Pumba take the Lion King opening sequence and their introduction to paradise is also entertaining. The only problem was the rendering of 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the movie, changing its lyrics and tune from the defeatist to the uplifting. <br /> <br /> History line is quite well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, although the final bit under the hyena chased the story a little bit credibly. The new story does not seem to handle saccharin or emotionally charged moments for good, and it does better when it comes to full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, go to it. For the penny pincher who is still willing to invest on a good flip, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
