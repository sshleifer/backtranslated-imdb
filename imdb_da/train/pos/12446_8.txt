After hearing about Modesty Blaise before, but never reading a novel or a comic book, my wife and I were able to talk a lot about the movie. It gave in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some action-flick elements, it's much more an intimate game, well written. Unfortunately, this is also where a great disadvantage of the film is revealed. An intimate game lives on its players' abilities and unfortunately only half of the delivered is delivered. While Alexandra City did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the villain Miklos - did not. Smiling through the plot as if it is an expanded toothpaste commercial, he fails to build an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece. The support molding is somehow similar, from some stereotypical gangsters and slots to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
