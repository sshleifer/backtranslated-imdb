I first saw the Ice Age in Subiaco Cinemas, when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at that time, but even then I liked it. It had some kind of heat. <br /> <br /> We've had it on video for years now, and no matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. This is due to the one element that makes it different from all the other 3D animations that were made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home' as they leave. They are nomads, and it is really refreshing and uplifting to see. <br /> <br /> Also, every single character on the surface seems to be just putting up with each other, but they are really all good friends. As well as all the characters have their own charm (even the evil guys). Sid sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive kind of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, etc. <br /> <br /> Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled by clay, giving the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movies is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really understand it until you see it a couple of times, and even then it has a small effect on the way you watch the movie. Because of this, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would really be pathetic in an attitude like the Ice Age. <br /> All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is evidence of how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
