When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a couple of months I figured it was too real. The few reviews I read were not made by sucking fangirls, not very promising. <br /> <br /> As I was able to see it, I was fully prepared to groan, twist and otherwise have to close my eyes to avoid silliness. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and good. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's a little impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man who is not known for his hygiene - But all in all it was fun. <br /> <br /> No, it is not a work of cinema genius, but it is very, very heartfelt, fun, with fun choreography, touching score and fun casting. I know a bit of Japanese film, so I can't really judge the actor, but given the fact that the actor spoke a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at some point and that a couple of them almost have no theater experience , I was quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it as it comes to Region 1. <br /> On a page note there is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I didn't even see much of a subtitle. Don't let people who read too much in things ruin this for you.
