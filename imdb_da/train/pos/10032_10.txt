I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I highly recommend looking for everyone. It's a movie to see with your family far. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, long-lasting disastor scenes, nudity / sexuality and some language.
