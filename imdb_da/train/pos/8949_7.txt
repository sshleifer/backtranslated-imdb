Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his last trip as a romantic lead) and Novak raise this, Stewart's second "Christmas movie" movie to over mid-level entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars creates a rather moving experience, and further revelation can be obtained from the film, whose witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that impedes many people's relationships. All in all, a good diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
