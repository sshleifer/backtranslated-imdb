Mendez and Marichal have given us a serious, compelling and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism has created in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I've met, yet because our nation refuses to face the imperialist responsibility of the face, has Puerto Rican's right to die and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis created by the colonial situation in Puerto Rico, if undermining families, and the basic institutions that maintain a community. Corruption is fierce to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which has led to a fiscal crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and mistrust permeates the island's culture. Fortunately, a supplement allowed this painful but powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> A must see. . .
