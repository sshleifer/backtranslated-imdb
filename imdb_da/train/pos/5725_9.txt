This is what I wrote to some friends earlier: HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is honest with God, one of the craziest movies I've ever seen! I either get very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (Can't wait for the Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared to sit in the dark theater and wished I had someone, someone sitting next to me (except the main character in Grudge I saw the movie by myself.) I swear, there were many many scenes that were not expected! I felt silly, but my nerves didn't use it! I was on the edge of the whole movie, from the opening credits, and the music was terrifyingly scary. I'm still thinking of that sound and I don't like it! <br /> <br /> Actually, I got up a few times and wept, "oh" on a scene !! Oh yes I even covered my eyes a couple of times! Words to the wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated the Event Horizon and thought who wrote it was sick and mental, but I can't remember the movie so I can't compare. <br /> <br /> I can't say I "enjoyed" this movie b / c I was scared but it was very very good and scary. Ending the scene too ... whoa! To be a 32-year-old mom, I think I can have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please get out of my head;) <br /> In summary, this is not a slasher flick that I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a most ghostly movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two big trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
