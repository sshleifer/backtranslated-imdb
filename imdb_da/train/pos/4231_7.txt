Returning from a Christmas Eve, a battered suburban wife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle to survive after a disagreement with a group of criminal youths takes a violent journey. <br /> <br /> Suffering from the indignity of a direct DVD release here in Britain, Susan Montford's direct debut may not get the recognition it deserves. This is a shame as the standardization of writing, control and acting is very good and even exceeds the quality of your average just for DVD flick. Kim Basinger gives his best performance for some time as the offended wife of a violent man (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer is nothing more to do than to be a threatening presence, in their short scenes, Basinger associates - showing painful vulnerability yet, suggesting the anger that will eventually boil in her confrontations with the youth. It's a really great, discreet performance, her conversion from victim to aggressor played unhindered. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas I originally thought to be mistaken as he (along with the other three youths) did not seem to be much of a threat. But all four youths had been more physically impressive, the later scenes where Basinger turned the tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly uninhibited, is the key to why the film works as well as it does. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few pacing problems in the last half of the movie and a few cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when filming is over. Some may be averted by the open-ended, slowly burnt nature or the sudden end. Others of the sometimes brutal violence. I say give it a try, it is certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V.
