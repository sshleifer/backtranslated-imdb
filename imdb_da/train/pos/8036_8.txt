Some guys think snipers aren't good because the action part of it wasn't good enough. Well, if you consider it an action movie, this point of view can be quite true, as the action part of this movive isn't actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an act. <br /> <br /> The film especially told about the inside of two snipers, which certainly had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked like he was cold hearted. But after Beccket showed his daydream about Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partner's victim that made Beccket so-called cold. <br /> <br /> However, Millar was a new comer, a green hand and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show the hesitation and fear of the millar when he first tried to "put a ball through one's heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought of the actual suicide task was that it could be easily reached and then he could surely come back and receive the prize. These two guys were quite different in their personalities, and I think the movie had successfully shown the difference and impact they had to each other because of the difference in their personalities. These two snipers scolded each other, suspected each other and finally came to an understanding of the communication and of what they had done to help themselves save the other. Sniper is not a good action movie, but a good psychological one.
