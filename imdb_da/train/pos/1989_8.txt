I admit not to love Oliver! as a young child - it is long and the story is a bit slow because of all the songs. As a teenager, I discovered that fun in this movie is the experience itself. Instead of thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is at best loose, but really, if you see a musical, you are not there for the story. The music is at the heart of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very captivating. Most or all casts were involved in the scene version of musical, and it shows in their performances - and I consider this a plus. The performances are all in a more "stagey" style, typically acting for much older movies, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the child playing Oliver, whose work seemed to look sweet and stay out of the way of the right artist. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job maintaining a scary screen presence like the threatening Bill Sykes. Even Sykes' dog Bullseye has a good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will banish it, just like those who take the musicals too seriously. Nitpicking over erroneous historical details or erroneous exaggerated scene type that works for bad acting destroys everyone's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that as a musical, a fantasy is loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.
