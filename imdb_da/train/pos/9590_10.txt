Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC, where black and Latin women are holding "balls". This is where they dress, but they like, stiffen their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on. We get to know many of the members and see how they all stick together and support each other. As one man says to another, "You have three strikes against you - you're black, gay, and a dragon queen." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only on the balls. There they can be who and what they want and be accepted. Then the film cuts to three years later (1989), and you can see how things have changed (tragic for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but it's not. Most of the interviewees are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - just as they should. We find that they all live in "houses" run by different "mothers" and all help each other out. The feeling of community in this movie is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a big hit. It won the best documentary awards at many festivals - but was never nominated for an Oscar. Their reason was "Black and Hispanic dragon queens are not Academy material". Fascinating isn't it? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Today, it's still a good movie - and for a while. It's just not that anymore - NY they show no longer exists. The balls are still kept, but not in the spirit we see here. Also features have become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I've heard the houses are also gone. It's a little sad. I want to know where these characters are now - I know two died of AIDS, but I have no idea of ​​the others. And what happened to the 13-year-old and 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> It's still a unique documentary - fascinating, fun, and zealous. A must see all the way! A certain 10. Where is the DVD ???
