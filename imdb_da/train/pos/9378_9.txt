Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage is being recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real hit man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. Being more anchored, the more he tries to free himself. And small town America doesn't seem to be so safer than Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this movie has lots of plot twists that seem unlikely, but all lead to the cathartic self-discovery.
