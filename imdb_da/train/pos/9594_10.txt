While many unfortunately continued, the ballroom scene is still very vibrant and carries their heritage. Some are still very alive and quite good, Octavia is more brilliant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very successful and gives a great support to gay community as a whole. Pepper Labeija went straight ahead in last year's natural cause, May she rest in peace. After Anji's passers-by, Carmen became the mother of Xtravaganza's house (she was in the beach scene) and she also looks more and more lovely. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have gone, they can all rest in peace. There is currently another project underway, known as "How do I look?", Please check the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
