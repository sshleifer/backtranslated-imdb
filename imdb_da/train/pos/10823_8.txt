I always wanted Johnny Concho, and I want this movie to be on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Frank in the movie's title role, he is the brother of a notorious gunfighter out of town at the moment. The brother strikes terror in the heart of the city, and Frank takes full advantage of it to bully the mayors in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feelings for him. She is the daughter of storager Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other gunmen arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark, and it turns out that Conrad has killed Sinatra's brother and he comes to his city to take over. They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Accommodation Sinatra turns from punk to onion and becomes a man looking for a kind of backbone. It's a well-behaved achievement, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm. Sin for some reason, this has not been seen for years. Two other recordings of note are Keenan Wynn as former shooter became preacher, helping Sinatra find what he needs to stand up for Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad in what I think was his career role on the screen. He is a villain of incredible malice, pure evil incarnation, who goes and speaks on the silver screen. But what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax of an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's just say I think Johnny Concho was MGM's High Noon response and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break in all law and order.
