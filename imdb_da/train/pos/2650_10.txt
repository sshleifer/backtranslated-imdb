In addition to the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries although this is an easy feat, considering the director ). The flawless movie style, the actor and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) music - make it the miracle masterpiece. I saw the TV miniseries some years ago and liked the story, and I had my hope for it when I got it. It was me away !!! It's far better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (Kubrick brand) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the excitement. The intro scene is at least a classic, and I saw it about 20 times just for the shifting atmosphere it evokes for the whole movie. Also, the film does not give much fun (it has just enough, and it is by no means distasteful) a trend that I hate in recent days horror movies. Just see it!
