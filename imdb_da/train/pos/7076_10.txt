A very strong movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. As I think, there are two cities missing in the receptionist from the list, Bruce recalled. <br /> <br /> That means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Now, Novikov property seems to me to work in this movie. But I believe in Back to the future theory of world diversity. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. In the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself. <br /> <br /> And I think there's no problem in that. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown from Back ... <br /> But the story pf 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories of a world or many or continuum, one can believe that he is really crazy and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost. <br /> <br /> A series of events that can make her believe he is from the future. The ball - well it can be a mistake, a fake. <br /> <br /> Well I like this movie - need to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
