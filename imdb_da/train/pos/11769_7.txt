I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a scary movie. But when I popped it into the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as the sheriff. The end stage of Bill's house is very excellent, good camera work, good dialogues and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie has stolen $ 12 million from the mafia. Together with his wife, he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia runs him down and wants $ 12 million. Bill can only rely on the only person he knows inside himself.
