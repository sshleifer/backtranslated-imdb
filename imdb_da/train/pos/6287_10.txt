gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy movie that made over $ 100 million, but was blasted by most critics. Personally, I thought it was a good movie. The story was credible and probably has the greatest cast for ever for this type of movie, including 3 academic prize winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie. Other than the lame stunt at the end, this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (out of ****)
