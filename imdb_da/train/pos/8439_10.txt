For all the homicide junkies out there, this movie was amazing! Every single character ever on the show came to terms with the film. It helped solve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually looked at the series, most of the joy would be lost when the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence. This would probably have been appropriate as a serial final as opposed to being a separate movie, but we must take what we can get. I hope they make more movies and continue to highlight homicidal signs of law and order.
