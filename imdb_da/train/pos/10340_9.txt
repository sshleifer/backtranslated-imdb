Although this film came out a year before I was born, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It's Save Foxx as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he knows nothing about what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypical ideas about what gay people are. His son, Norman, has now grown up and lives on his own. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit hoping to change him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben arrives at Norman's apartments, he enters a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in a row ("Norman ... Is that you?"). The movie made me laugh from start to finish. Scared Foxx is amazing. Although much of the content is stereotypical, I did not find anything offensive about how the material was handled, and it even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
