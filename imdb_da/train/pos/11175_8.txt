So often with Stephen King customizations, you just get a collection of characters that recite dialogue from the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Perhaps because they do not use large clumps of text from the book, but it is a bit more of an improvement in the events of history. Miko Hughes, a baby Gage, is a big part of her success. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really seem like his parents. There is a scene where Louis cuts Gage and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is fantastic. He nails the Maine accent perfectly without falling into parody, and is clever and warm as Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
