This show was amazing, it wasn't just for kids that I initially thought it was for the whole family. The first season was mostly about father looking for two daughters and son he unfortunately passed in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed they continued with the show as what would really happen in real life, and I must mention The Goodbye Episode it was so well made, it must be so hard for them to film this, You could tell they were real tears in their eyes. I am a 24-year-old man and this episode made me cry when I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13, like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 had great comedy which also in season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky Friday, secrets. I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it ended, it was a best no it was the best family comedy show ever since Home Improvement, and it could have been the next friends. <br /> <br /> it should never be completed but still love to see the repetitions every day.
