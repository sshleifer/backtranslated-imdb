My choice for the best movie ever used to be Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", which is still amazing in my canon. But it may have been replaced by "Shower", which is the most artistic Thai movie I've seen. The way in which caring for others is represented by the water flows, and the way in which water can be inspired and comforted, and purification and etc. Is the essence of the Dao. It is possible to argue that the NOFTH and the shower voices are similar and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity, as the bathhouse operators represent the purest form of Daoism. I would not argue in any way for such an interpretation. Both films are visual pleasures in their integration of idea and image. Yet, Shower presents such an unsteady view of everyday sanctuary that I give it the nod. I honor both.
