I just want to say I'm so glad someone finally wasted the beans on this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous farce with film making. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give Spazz credit to take the absurd time a care to find such a rare picture and then COME COMMENT IT! Most people I know don't have that kind of time, especially so few will end up reading it. Kudos to you gentleman! Anyway, the movie follows a thin story that is at least incredible and simply stupid. I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why hire such horrible actresses! Also what kind of instructor has to shop, write, produce and also edit the picture! Choose a job and put all your love for that man! It's such a shame because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz to pull the curtain back on this movie, people like you are a rare find.
