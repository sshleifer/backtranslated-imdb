"Little Rain" has never been the critic of the critic, but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you're a prince fan, it's for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is that Prince sees his parents in his own right, and he falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is heart-warming. Sometimes it comes out, has fun, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and miss. <br /> <br /> No one can really work in the movie. Everyone is from one of the Prince side actions such as "Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, it adds charm to the movie. When Prince Prince is on the screen he lights it up and it's fun to see him at his commercial highlight. <br /> <br /> Finally, go see this if you love Prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one.
