A group of friends decide to take a camping trip in the desert - and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pickup truck. "Mirage" is of course inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes". Put this slasher yarn offering lots of nasty violence and doings. The movie's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man who has his arm and leg linked around a tree and then has his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck. There is also some excitement and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences. The action is quite lame and the manuscript is rather weak, but the movie is fast and shocking. The bad guys who play the villain are quite threatening. Desert places give some atmosphere and gore is pretty strong. Overall, if you like low budget horror movies give this a look.8 out of 10.
