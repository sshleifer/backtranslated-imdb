1.) This movie was amazing! I saw it while I was in town next to the one where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings in which the story took place. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaals best !! My favorite parts were also science fairs and all times with her father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and his father did not seem to break any way. This roof line is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to light the sky." 2.) The way this movie was shot was impeccable, it was so credible that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. Dress was accurate and they had their snake down too. Definitely recommend this movie!
