This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most thrilling and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is doing his best priest here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer to the matter, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him he is a Mulkurul who seems to be a race of supernatural beings living in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high precipitation seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last absence, the one who will drown the world. <br /> <br /> The dream sequences and the supernatural effects reinforce this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as chap with the difficult name playing Charlie, the old Aboriginal who can turn into an owl. The Climax and the end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this cannot be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
