Much to your supposed happiness fair readers, Cage and Hopper met and fortunately not in a Lynch movie ?? because RED ROCK WEST is far better than any Lynch movie ??. Nicolas Cage is a third actor actor, porcelain babe is a surrogate femme deadly, only father hopper is as mediocre as ever ??. RED ROCK WEST is, despite the trite cast, one of my favorite American thrillers; In a word, a thriller with some terms. Especially gusto, the amazing pace, the excitement, the exciting excitement, Lara Flynn Boyle's sweet, tight little ass, Cage's enviable physical form (though undeniably ugly, with sharp bird features, thick eyebrows and thin rare hair, Cage showed a fine overall shape ?), Hopper's complete routine, some moderate but really fun moments, Cage's play with his intended persona, Hopper's rigid psychopathic allure, Lara's meanness, Cage seems a roamer, the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema, hungry, hard, if it is necessary, naive, dirty and tired. Lara Flynn Boyle performs as the cold mediocre seducer, Walsh as his heartless man, and Hopper as Lynchian's hitman he has already done before. Cage actually looks pretty groggy or dizzy or very confused and has a serious hangover. But this may be his regular appearance.
