Savage Island's fury will scare hell out of you! Trust me. <br /> <br /> When Savage Family's boy is driven by some city-slicker tourists, Pa Savage wants revenge and he stops at nothing until he gets it. <br /> This is a real horror movie with some truly amazing horror moments. <br /> <br /> Also, the negative review comes clearly from a person who lacks proper knowledge of film. The filmmakers chose light and camera work to reflect the darkness, creepy, and Egyptian mood of history; in other words, to achieve some aesthetics. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie has won several horror movie festival awards.
