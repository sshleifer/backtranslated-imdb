On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a lurid, shiny soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But underneath it is a deep, social commentary in the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another University sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, also loves her. When Stack finds out, he is sterile, and Bacall ends up getting pregnant, fireworks flying. And the all-too-good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayl of Texas' biggest nympho who was scolded by the Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
