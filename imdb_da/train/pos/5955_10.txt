As a maker of "This Darkness" I admit that we neglected 3 very important accolades in our final credits. The omissions were over-sights that could not be corrected once, nor did the parties involved - who saw the film - mention it at that time. On behalf of the film's excellent cast and crew, I apologize to them. Obviously, some criticisms here are hard in the face of their credit accident. Our production values ​​were insignificant and our "special effects" were quite special, but the plot is very strong and the lyrics of John McLeod are amazing. We hope you, the reader, enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked their bows for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
