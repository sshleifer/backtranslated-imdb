"Scarface" has a great cult follow up now, 22 years after the release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized as being very sticky, untouched, over-the-top and all inflated! These are people who compare Scarface with The Godfather movies. It is true that Scarface on the technical front (film, acting, direction, etc.) is behind 'The Godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it is also true that what Scarface has and another gangster movie shortage is rawness, the sheer raw approach of gangsters. Latino gangsters in this movie look much more threatening and genuine than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters of other gangster classics such as 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of Scarface's greatest winning points and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as "tackiness" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface and I have to say that both of these films are too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original of "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being over-the-top and high in this movie. But what about considering that it's exactly the way the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who makes quick decisions and throws tantrums every two minutes! He's not the quiet Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very sticky, untrained person who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> There is certainly a very 80's feeling of this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, Rebenga Heath, the first meeting with Sosa and Toni's visit to her mother. About the show: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He allegedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana most throughout his career. And it really looks like he has enjoyed himself in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would be without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana, and in all cases the movie wouldn't be so effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tiger's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is great as Tony's boss, Lopez. Then F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) is in a small role. <br /> <br /> There is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is sufficient in her role. The director goes a little overboard under a certain part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that it was the only small part that suffered from improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies ever released. Enjoy what it is: a raw portrayal of the drug addicts and their gangland!
