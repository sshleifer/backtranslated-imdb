One thing about Hollywood, someone is successful and it's always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson received such recognition for his performance in the Texas-based movie Giant, which Universal Leaders must have believed, let's get him to another modern Texas setting. Similarly, Robert Stack got good reviews for The High and The Mighty as the pilot who burst under the burden of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up roll. <br /> <br /> Both of these ends were obtained in Posted on Wind. Before Hudson was the big runner, he is now the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, James Dean part without the James Dean racism from the Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Stack's Hadley Oil Company uses. Hudson likes her, but she's blinded by Stacks millions and when he's a girl, he has the means to really pursue a campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, who is Stable's amorous sister who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not being merged with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless movie hero before landing this gem. She received a Best Supporting Actress Award for her as Marilee Hadley, and it was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the movie for you.
