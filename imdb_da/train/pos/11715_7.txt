This is a cute little horror spoof / comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess all the time. This was supposed to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was retrieved by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to get the busty child in black, but unfortunately, sit-com never made it past the pilot phase because of the sexual references. However, this movie is very entertaining. Elvira is the modern Chesty Morgan and the queen of single-liners. This movie was followed up a few years later by the miserable "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which was supposed to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies, but fell flat on that face. Watch this movie instead of a much more entertaining experience!
