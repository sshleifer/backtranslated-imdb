I'm a very big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ass off under Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious movie, especially the Truman Show. This one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side. He is, of course, a lot of fun in this movie, but there are very serious parts and he pulls it off with ease. He is really a multifunction actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the player, I was fond of Jennifer Aniston's play. I think she is more than just a few good breasts and big ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are very fun, especially in the anchor scene. All in all, I have to judge this one 9. Good acting, fun script and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
