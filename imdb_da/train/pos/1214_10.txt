It all began with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse getting the club safe. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and took them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the foster painter went down more and the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse check to see if it's Dark Heart, but they can't go unless the club stays so they ask Dawn & John to look after the club. After True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse Come back, they send Dawn & John back to camp. As the club and cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight the Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart kidnaps all the foster children, and the kids (Dawn & John) tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. Than they work together to save Care Bears. Later, the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse found the dark heart shade and returned to nurturing soil to find out they were gone. Kids (Dawn, John, & Christy) come, but they were not powerful to stop the Dark Heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse will help Dawn, John & Christy unleash the other caregivers, but Christy got in the way and was hit by Dark Heart magic. When Dark Heart saw Christy, he was hit and stopped fighting with the foster bar to help her, but he can't because Dark Heart (himself) doesn't have the power to save Christy. The Nursing Children & Kids Help Dark Heart Save Christy. Now Dark Heart is starting to break and became a real boy to fall in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy train in camp. <br /> <br /> This is a good move ever and the best Care Bears Movie I ever see. <br /> <br /> I, as everybody cares, carries movies and I can't wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
