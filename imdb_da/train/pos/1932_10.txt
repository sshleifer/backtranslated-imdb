I think I usually turn to movie festival comedy with the low expectation that they will always be "quirky" and that any particular humor will be derived solely at the expense of the simplicity of the character in the face of a complicated context. What was unusual about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his movie while still finding ridiculous humor in the scene after stage. There was a sophistication, perhaps also because of DP's sharp work, I have rarely seen in an indie film and even less so in a comedy. Of particular note here: Paget Brewster is betting as the Amy math teacher. Having seen this achievement, I do not understand why Brewster has not been "discovered" by a larger audience. She brings the necessary mix of anger and equality to the role that really helps this image reach its potential. This is a fantastic job that deserves a bigger audience. I look forward to more from the director and this cast!
