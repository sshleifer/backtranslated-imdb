Just as Al Gore shook us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary "An Inappropriate Truth," directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it is time to improve our lifestyle to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that global warming of our planet has catastrophic consequences for all living creatures worldwide. Al Gore showed us the gloomy future on the planet Earth by presenting hard facts supported by documented examples through long, but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose another, but equally effective way to achieve this. They do not present us with a future representation of what may occur on our planet if we do not radically change things around, but rather they show us the real beauty of the earth in all its glorious glory. We see places that we knew existed, but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide selection of the most extraordinary places such as abandoned deserts, gigantic forests full of fauna and flora and icy landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all these vastly different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is just the kind of movie to make, in combination with the one from Al Gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to interfere with. The voice-over of Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done, although at first it sounded like I was watching an X-Men movie instead! The camera is probably the most remarkable thing in this documentary. At times: What you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera should actually shoot all the lovely footage. In short: This is definitely a must-see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
