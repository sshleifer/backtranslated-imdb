This is one of the most overlooked gems Hollywood has ever produced. - A young British fighter ace from World War II whose aircraft is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing he will be dead within minutes. For some reason, the man who should surely be dead must go away from the wreck and finally learn that he should report to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, he denies and demands to have his "day in court" to argue for his case. The man claims that his situation had changed in the last moment of his mortal life, that he had fallen in love and therefore had become another person, who deserved a chance to continue. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a cinematic joy! "The jury's jury's announcement is a clear highlight. The story, as amazing as it seems, is engaging and will keep you spellbound for the almost 2 hours of playing time. The final scene is simply beautiful and requires a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my personal all-time favorite top 10, it has my highest recommendation!
