The 12th animated Disney classic is a fair movie told through a simple story. Although slightly dated, it deserves a place on the Disney classics list. It is not among Disney's best works, but it is satisfactory. One of Disney's most "simple" works, yes, but holds some magic and enchantment (which old Disney is known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this were a mistake, there would be no more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somehow a return to Disney's first animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") because it brings back the adventure genre. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I assume it's a place in France because it's based on a story by Charles Perrault. There are lots of sympathetic characters, such as Cinderella, the prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), Fairy Godmother (for an adventure, she is sure to be fun), the birds, the wife and the grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very smart and entertaining. I love his voice. Really it has mouse-like quality. Gus may not be that smart, but he is humorous. The king is funny, but I think what makes him so funny is his short temper. Grand Duke is a very cool guy and fun too. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and are responsible for many of the most entertaining moments. The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt, Prince Philip from "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (founder) doesn't have to be sympathetic because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the staple is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the protagonist, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, handsome and lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilarious. The way he goes, puts his nose in the air and the arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him fun. Ironically, he is very much like a governor when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the founders' attitudes to cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is such a devil and mean cat. But there is nothing annoying about him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but comfortable, even though it's not among Disney's best. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". There are lots of well-known talented voters in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <br /> <br /> Despite being easy to see, the film has a good work of art, as well as its fine details, even though it is never "out-of-this-world". The King's Palace, however, is a spectacular masterpiece that is truly majestic and colossal.
