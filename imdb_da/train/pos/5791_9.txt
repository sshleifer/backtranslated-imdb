This should be one of my most favorite Twilight Zone episodes, primarily for depicting two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. Spider-woven tights and mined streets are scary in the special way Twilight Zone does best. <br /> <br /> Although the parable may be a little heavily handled by today's drama standards, it is an excellent one - using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as the geopolitics on a way that is timeless. The whole drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr Bronson and Mrs Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (They must both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
