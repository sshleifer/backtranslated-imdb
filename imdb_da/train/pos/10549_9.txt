I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it will be widely released because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot can be <br /> <br /> considered as spoilers, so I'm just saying the story is clever, the play is great and the effects are amazing. Well-felt and well-conscious too. One of the best movies I've seen for years, and very refreshing in the summer of sad <br /> <br /> movies. It had the audience laughing all the time. See it if you can. (I especially liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene.)
