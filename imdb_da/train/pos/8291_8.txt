"The Lady in Question (1999)" starring Gene Wilder is a well-functioning mystery drama reminding me of the old black and white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and "Cash" kept me guessing right up to the end. There were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but I had no idea what sign it would be. Gene Wilder has a particularly charming humor about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal curves, which makes him perfect for that. The parts of the film that portrayed actors did were done very well. I'm sure this is an extra challenge for the shooter to pull off. I'm not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. Even his song was a pleasure. I like him in this role more than his former "sillier" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope the A&E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries." <br /> <br /> The music fits the period. I enjoyed the cool live combo and swing tunes. I was a little unclear in the beginning, whether we saw a feedback or whether the action took place during this period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary for the script's flow. For me, it always distracts. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I have had the other in a well-established start in what we hope will be many others - like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burrs Perry Mason.
