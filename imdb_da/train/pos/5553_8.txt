Slow but beautifully mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling seems much less heavy-handed than in his previous historical era and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is an extremely pig, Neil Hamilton is poor, but dashing and Carol Dempster are .... Well, Carol Dempster is most of what is wrong with Griffith during this time, but she doesn't often find enough to slow down and drama. <br /> <br /> Please note that the trivia of this movie says it originally came in just over 2 hours when it was first released, but that no cuts last longer than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release has been presented with a slower FPS speed that increases the voltage and brings it back to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in storytelling than audio versions such as Patriot. Although it's not quite in the league for Griffith's best, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, it's an excellent way to spend a few hours on.
