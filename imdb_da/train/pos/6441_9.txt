As it is in heaven {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> This was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that regains the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a superior gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and must give up. When he joins a church choir as his cantor, he creates a change in the life of the Kororists, just as Jesus did for the first-century society in Palestine. They laugh, they start talking openly and truthfully to each other, their mistakes are exposed, they accept each other, come to love each other, become a vital community. They include the mentally handicapped young man (? Tore), such is their inclusivity. Pastor Stig enjoyed power by imposing a morale on the congregation, and this is gradually being rejected by the Kororists. When Stig rejects Daniel, there is a rebellion and Stig is crushed. Stig represents Jewish authorities on the day of Jesus whose demands for obedience to the Jewish law gave a sharp contrast to the new life by "the golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin". Throughout the film, there is this contrast between moral and vital life. Important to Christ's story, Daniel is killed by Conny as he raises him, leaving him drowning in the river. Next scene we can hardly believe when Daniels (resurrected!) Body is drawn into his room (grave) draped in a white linen sheet (holster!) Of three women (three women held vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel) . Daniel is drawn close to Lena, a warm, beautiful young woman betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous (Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene-Lena - who was probably a high class courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he has longed for, and now finds fulfillment. Solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, is about living a full life as opposed to moral correctness. It leads to concern for sin, and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the choir all song / humming in harmony, as a mantra, drawing in the large audience, which exemplifies harmony and coherence, which is our true human destiny.
