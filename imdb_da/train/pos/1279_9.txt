This film is an entertaining and utterly sarcastic display of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the photography that consisted of vibrant colors and spin-doctored settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first large-scale experiment. A warning, don't take the film's message so seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and it's not a compliment). The message is a somewhat stylized post-college, neophyte view of society. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot line of a fictional 'zine editor verbally whipping mobocracy of the 90s.
