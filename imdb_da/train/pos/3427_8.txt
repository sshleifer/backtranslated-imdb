This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, homecoming can be the beginning of real problems. I recall that my father and his brothers return from World War II. For one of my uncles, the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something like the first 20 minutes to save private Ryan. For him the memories drove not only tortured, but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like several of my cousins, his sons. Go ahead for 60 years and set the soldiers in another war in another country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there is something about war that never changes. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will get away with more compassion for the soldiers trying to do what they think or have got to Knowing is right. <br /> <br /> The Tagline of the Vietnam War movie Platoon says it all. "The first war treasure is innocence."
