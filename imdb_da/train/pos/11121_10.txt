As a guy who has seen all seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw him change from laughter to paranoia immediately through the seasons and after every little gesture of his creator you think he is a gangster, you thought of yourself: OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangsters skin. But having seen him open his eyes and fight for his life, I think I could almost feel the pain he "made", we think he went through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But today they are either old or dead (Brando) and it is OK that they make smaller movies and their performances are "easier" than they used to be. I can't wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he plays a completely different role. Can you recommend me some of his older films, where he gives a memorable performance?
