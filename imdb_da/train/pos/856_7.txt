The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan alone is worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of "James Bond's psycho twin brother", separated at birth, without a doubt. As an intense keeper, his character is very sexual, but even better, much fun. Add the friendly and unpredictable American "guy next door" to Greg Contrast to create contrast. The incredible places, vibrant colors and fast-paced humor provide great entertainment. Hope Davis is well thrown as the "gem of a wife". But the focus of the film is on the two fellows, a new "Odd Couple", and that is the part that works very well. Have a big (probably R-rated) laugh and look for the places where History goes a little deeper.
