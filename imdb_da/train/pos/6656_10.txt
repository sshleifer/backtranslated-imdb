This movie is simply amazing. It was a very sensitive issue and the movie was fantastic. This movie did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was also kept low. Originally, I thought this movie would simply be a waste of time since most Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though it was very sensitive and add a love story to the original story and destroy everything ... most Indian viewers would agree this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies in India that would have become a milestone or mega hit if the love story would not be added unnecessarily. <br /> But the treatment looks great like Pinjar film (also a must). If it counts, I'd like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a great movie ..
