I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember my whole family going out to watch the movie. I remember a guy showing "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I also want to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsauts, and she was sick one evening and they saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she died this August. My mother was not a teenager and she was a few months away from giving birth to my little sister.
