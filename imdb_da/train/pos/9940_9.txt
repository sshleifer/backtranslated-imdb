This animation television series is simply the best way for kids to learn how the human body works. Yes, it is biology, but they will never tell it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". I remember finding small books and a plastic part in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. In the same stream you will find: "Il était une fois l 'homme', which relates the human history from the big bang to the 20th century. There are also:" Il était une fois l'espace "(about space and its exploration) but one is more a fiction than a description of reality since it takes place in the future.
