A great story about following your dreams and actually taking a staff to do something about them when the chance hits. Nothing was too easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job, a home loan, etc. - it wasn't as if he could just drop what he did and blithely jump on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took gut. I'm glad they showed their indecision, almost up until he got the calls to the big ones. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him chuckle against the Red Sox (I think ...) it was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid it's okay. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job with the man, the teacher, the coach and the "oldest rookie" .... As one who is in the same age group, I can certainly identify him. You are not too old to do what you had dreamed of as a child, but it comes there. You have to do it faster than lator. <br /> <br /> Told, nicely edited, paced, acted, good looking the familiar faces of late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work around, happy to see it here. <br /> <br /> *** without **** ... who would have thought that the Tampa Devil Rays would have been the subject of such a good movie early on?
