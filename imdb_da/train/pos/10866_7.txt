Johnnie To's ELECTION has some cool music on the opening credits and a good open credit design, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and the Asian mobsters solemnly take an oath or pronounced sacred things; In fact, the whole girl is nicely scored. I have found out that from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was very eager to see a Two movie. The one I started with, COMMITTEE, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent today to moderately moderate and also essentially violent; the story of an asian godfather dawn, it uses a puzzle game of elements, violent facts from mobster's life, race for scepter, true details, and as with Coppola, we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are right and nice and sympathetic . The performances are reasonably entertaining and colorful. CHOICE is well made in the cozy, somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong fare; the end is bitter, true, straight and will scare the kids.
