This film has a clear story, which is quite unusual with the musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework. "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) history touches the very core of human relations, especially the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on an "alleged" adventure, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" of Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how the Indonesians express themselves. I expect the choreographer to explore Indonesian dance, by not worrying the fact that Indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem uncomfortable in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and / or the music. Still, I still love this movie and consider it a new wave of Indonesian movie genres that I hope to improve in the future.
