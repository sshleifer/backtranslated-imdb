While the British produced some fun and smart sitcoms in the 1990s - Ab Fab, males performing poorly, One foot in the grave, etc. - The 70s were the real golden age. In the 1970s, there were completely new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the slowly growing awareness of a need for "sensitivity" that would, twenty years later, become political correctness. Attempts to interfere with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to sitcoms like Man About the House. (In the late 70s, this "grappling" resulted in more meditative and bittersweet sitcoms as masterpieces butterflies.) The house is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of all time - a little joyful, naughty, fresh, inventive, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made observations about today's life. Compare it to a cynical 90's show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe the two were created in the same country. The house is one of the great Britcoms in the 70s, right up there with good neighbors (the good life) and about the house's spin off George and Mildred. Its quality has been certified by - as with good neighbors - its creators, writers and many of its casts have continued success in British television.
