Fabulous movie! Rented DVD recently and became the floor of this amazing job. Douglas Sirk was a film-making genius, and he gets performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar's winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominated) and Lauren Bacall that words cannot describe. Paul Verhoeven paid a brilliant tribute to this movie by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stone's murderous inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> Eventually, the movie is hilarious, riveting, campy, biting, trashy, convincing, and eye-catching! It is clearly grandma from every foggy big and small screen soap operation, but no one has had the dazzling style you can see here: the camera's work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, opening fitting set to title song is unforgettable, the one-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will make you scratch your head on how the censors again let it make the final cut! <br /> <br /> While most older, highly regarded movies can sometimes be a dull task to sit through. Written in the wind contains so much and goes so fast that it is actually a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr Sirk for the craftsmanship - and Todd Haynes to point out - what has become one of my favorite movies all the time! SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
