Most of the feedback I've heard about the Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed. A few even say they think "it sucked". Well, to the people I say, get some fine imagination and go yourself. This was a very entertaining flick. The story begins with this mechanical failure, which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into those Gwar costume looks, deathbots called Necroborgs. Finally, you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a small parasite to you, which is then able to control your actions due to heat connections in your nervous system. Unfortunately, for two loving-seeking lonely young adults cross paths with the mechanical bug, and before you know it, transformations occur, and blood is scattered. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why are the necro bours fighting each other? Should the two desperate singles express their feelings for each other and make it unpleasant? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Entering the Meatball Machine I was a little wary because of the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a great surprise. Some unanswered questions, some average actions at times and a little confusing conclusion are the only weak points I can think of. From the anime it feels that the parasites become small figures themselves and even to the low budget, this film hits the right brand much more than it misses. With an ever-evolving story that is interesting enough to keep asking questions mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter, this is a flick of the bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check out. 8 out of 10
