One of my friends recommended this movie, citing my vocal and bending similarities to Des Howl, the film's protagonist. I think in a way that I can see it and maybe a little more, I'm not quite sure if it is flattering depiction. This is a beautifully unique work, the only movie that this can have More than a glancing equality would be True Romance, not for the content or style of the movie or for the pace of dialogue (Whale Music is just so much more, good, relaxed.) But instead of both representing modern love stories. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend the Hard Core Logo) and especially this movie. It has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most like-minded guy, but there is something about him pulling a sterling kind of empathy.
