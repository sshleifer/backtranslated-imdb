Yes, a tap dancing horror thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is denied and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 60s that leaked into the 70s. Released as a dual feature with Burt Reynold's comedy FUZZ, this crazy scare is so bonkers to be very entertaining. As a mix of LOCATION, THE OTHER, and BABY JANES DAY, I suggest that any potential viewer assumes that this is almost supposed to be skewed and sitting with someone with whom you can shake and elbow through it. In fact, get drunk while you watch it ..... on cheap champagne. Again, with many 30s movie ideas, they are also about error; Time's struggle for a better life gets bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this one is simply crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA De Niro - Winters shlock party that makes this movie look positively brilliant.
