"Happenstance" is the most New York emotional Parisian movie I've seen since "The Cat's Away (Chacun Cherche's son chat)." <br /> <br /> Last year's film released now to capitalize on Audrey Tatou's coming for "Amelie", his French title is more likely to: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon" as in summing up chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives. <br /> Tatou's gamine ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes the dazzling smile in the midst of her effortless adventure, and because she is part of a large multiethnic ensemble, so big that it took me a long time to sort out The characters, especially when some of the sweet guys and older women looked like me, and some of the characters fantasize about what they were supposed to do, so I wasn't sure if they did it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban coincidences were, from immigrants to loving nest to crowded metro stations to hang around in cafes. The subtitles pretty much annoyed both parts of a dialogue at once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
