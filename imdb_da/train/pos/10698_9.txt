A little funny movie. It's amazing, incredible, impossible. But it is funny how an inward-looking masochist can become completely dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl, he hardly knows, but who could come down in his fantasies. It is, of course, a termination of the stupid offers you can get on the internet. Don't believe in ten percent of what you're being told there, and never ever accept to tie your hands to someone or something or organization you don't know personally. Most of their "businesses" are somehow fooling you and advising you. But here the monkey deserves to be the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the movie becomes fun because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business that has the upper hand and ends up playing the same game with its victim fighter and win. One think is also safe. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I do not think it is better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all the rules and regulations, it is just fun to review their procedures and film them systematically . Then they have their revenge by losing your luggage, a real plague at modern airports, and don't expect to get reasonable compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see myself cutting myself through the plane's side with a can opener. Funny, isn't it?
