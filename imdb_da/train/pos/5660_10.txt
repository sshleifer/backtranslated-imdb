I may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired, but when I watched one episode on netflix I was also hooked. I saw the whole series in as 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First, he is thoroughly reprehensible, so you start to like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His folly Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson meets Satan is great. Charming, charismatic, smarmy and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind" I mean "really". I will be like HIM when I grow up. Lucas Black is also fantastic. The centers are also good. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
