I'm a big fan of the dukes of the Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed myself much more than I did with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's fun to hear people shine against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's very cruder than the show." Does anyone remember when humor is in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes, and Bo says Luke probably had faded half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up is because it switched to and earlier time slot. <br /> <br /> And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect Dukes plot. In fact, as a remake, it probably threatens the source material than any television show that has migrated to the big screen. While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like their small screen versions, they do a good job and work very well together. However, I wasn't so keen on Burt's boss Hogg. And I would like a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who didn't have a smile on their face when General Lee drives through the streets of Atlanta and Hazzard's back roads? People, let's enjoy a movie that's just an excuse for nostalgia, bikini and cargo, you won't be sorry. It's just a wonderful silly movie!
