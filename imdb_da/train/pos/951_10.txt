I know many people have a special love for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this movie on VHS and we see it together every Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could also see it on Halloween, because it is a very eerie ghost story. Scott - typecast as Scrooge - is appalling and uncomfortable and makes his transformation more miraculous and moving. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one frightening than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of Christmas Spirit. Still coming sends shakes down on my spine every year. And what a cast! David Warner is especially in top form as Bob Cratchit, as Susannah York is his wife. <br /> <br /> I think that this version is closer to the original story than most others - but I have to confuse it since it has been several years since I read it. Whether this is a fantastic Christmas classic.
