I didn't want to see this show. But I'm glad I did. The critics of this just don't get it! It is one of the most fun and entertaining things at T.V at the moment! Although the interview was done with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and that is a ridiculous uprising. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the toddlers and the mother is invaluable. Men and wife birds talk about health issues and the male bird takes a shot after wife said she was constipated completely broke me! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've ever seen in a while! Hopefully it will be back next summer when this race is over.
