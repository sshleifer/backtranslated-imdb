I saw this important intense movie tonight. Its Richard Gere and Claire Danes most important and best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex driver registration manager. Claire Danes is riveting as the woman do handpicks to replace him - a woman he is trying to learn everything he can while examining a final case where Geres character is convinced that one of them he is being charged for Monitoring can hold a young girl hostage. The subject is shocking, sexual offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie will soon not be forgotten. I know that I will be haunted by Geres's depiction for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins depiction of a serial killer has a screen portrait scared and then engaged me. The movie opens with a shocking statistic, so don't miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Geres' finest role proves the man can act. The Danes can just as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film. <br /> <br /> This is a gutsie film and Gere gives a multi-layer deep-felt performance. Just give him Oscar now ... he deserves it!
