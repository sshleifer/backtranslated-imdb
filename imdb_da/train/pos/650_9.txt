An amazing movie, quite challenging than really entertaining. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you loved, say what I tell you now: "Goodbye, I go." But disappearing, hiding as a criminal, is unclear. (so it doesn't have English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There is so much tactic involved in the relationship between Alexandre and the others, yet everyone longs for a little more truth. But knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences. Common interpretation is that the film criticizes the possible possibility of "liberated love" by portraying the unwanted consequences for those involved. It actually shows it in a convincing way, but I would appreciate it if the causes had been dealt with a little more in depth: it is not that liberated love itself is doomed to failure, but people (especially men I think) should Work on oneself and try to overcome the prevailing morality before and not by practicing released love. <br /> <br /> It's said the movie is realistic and really worth seeing.
