"GOOD TIMES," in my opinion is a must-see CBS hit! Despite having never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, although I like everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout their run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TV Land now, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well into the air.
