I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the newer shows to shame, great time! Anyone who has never seen it, as I cannot see how it is possible, should see it. It's a great show for everyone of all ages. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. It is true that some people feel that there are some "cheesy" aspects to the show, but the positive aspects weigh all the "cheeses" aspects. Full House ran the first episode on September 22, 1987 titled "Our very first show" and ran the last episode on May 23, 1995 titled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The concept of the show is very credible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a full drive. Danny has her brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos) who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse are planning to move in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help and end up living with them for eight years; the number of years running. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some of the characters and actor / actor who played him / her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break. In full house, John Stamos does a good job describing his character. He saw and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a full drive. He has to raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a good job showing a single parent working full time and still having time to raise her three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): A word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is big. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He does a good job at the stand-up comedian and waits for his big break. Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's a great actress. She plays the oldest sister, DJ, short of Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her training at Full House was very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, amazingly amazing! I wish I could say everything I would like to say about Jodie, but I would use up to 1000 words maximum on her. She got started in a kids show called Mother Goose Stories, and when she came to Full House, she broke the minds of audiences and creators. Her beautiful looks and absolutely amazing plays have helped make the show a success, it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was to be the star's show. It was supposed to be where she would get her big break. Jodie, five years old, when the show first aired, could hit any line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children cannot do this. As you can probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they started. They received Michael's part because they were the only babies who didn't cry while they were in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many more cast members to be recognized. It's the original characters from where the show first aired in 1987. The only negative I can say is how Full House became Michelle Show to the end. I think it was focusing on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a good life, even if a tragedy, such as the Losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said, there are only a few things to say; Full house will never die and thank you Cast of Full House for giving everyone a show they can enjoy.
