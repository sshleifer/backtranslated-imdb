The only other review of this movie from this date really destroys the stars and the movie itself. I usually read the user's comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I don't know much about. It is unfortunate when there are not many comments on a particular tile because when there is only one review and it unnecessarily destroys the movie and cast, you do not get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before I looked at this title, and I don't know where everything married to this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, although the material was not the largest. I found the movie and the show fun and enjoyable. It's not one of the great all-time classics, but a comfortable and fun diversion - much more than you can expect in most recent movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
