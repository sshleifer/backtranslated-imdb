This is not a movie you look for entertainment, at least most I know it wouldn't. <br /> <br /> It portrays the cruelty to both body and mind happening in a war, quite well, the signs seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", find something more often in books and rarely in movies, but this is done very well in this paragraph. I would place it next to "All quiet on the western front" and "Die Br√ºcke" to leave a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could see it at school with the other two movies - though finding a copy of it turned out to be pretty hard - which is a shame.
