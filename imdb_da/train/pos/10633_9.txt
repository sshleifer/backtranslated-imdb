This movie is as unique as it is overlooked ...... Another story is just what it shows that out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the ability to love if one has an open heart as well as an open mind. I saw the first cable at the end of the 70s, and it really showed the limits of homosexuals at the time. I think this movie was ahead of its time depicting a small piece of a fuzzy lifestyle. It really is a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS, so not only the extraordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still have to go where conditions are concerned.
