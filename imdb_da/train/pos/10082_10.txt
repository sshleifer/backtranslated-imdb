The film is really exciting, unique and uplifting. History is universal, because it is a struggle between good, evil and the world between. The most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading and a travesty. Blockbuster has judged it to be an X-rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subtitles.
