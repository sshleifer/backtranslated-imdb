I saw the first thing at a foreign film festival. It is a beautifully paced nail piece about a plot to facilitate the Estonian Treasury of one billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallin actually looked much less gloomy in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There's also a lot of humor and a little romance. I do not want to spoil a number of surprising but logical surprises, so I just want to say that this hoist movie starts with a good script and the director and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most thrilling example of its genre --- I will set it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it is miles ahead of the new OCEAN's 11, but (deliberately) not so brilliant. Rent or buy it now.
