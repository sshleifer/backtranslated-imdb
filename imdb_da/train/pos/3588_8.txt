When I watched this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I have seen many films that are about rape, but this one stands out. This film has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today, let alone television films. It tells a story that I am sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today and I found it very credible (which is somewhat difficult to find in other rap-centered films). I also thought Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were great in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have suffered from a harsh reality for them. I enjoyed it very much.
