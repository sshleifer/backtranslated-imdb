I loved this movie. I saw it only when I was 20 (there were only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much I took my own copy the next day. Comedy is well played by everyone involved. I always have to rewind and look at the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for Jason Robard's father playing Mr. Retch. Talent ran in that family.
