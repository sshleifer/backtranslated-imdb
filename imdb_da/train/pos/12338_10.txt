Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film. She plays convincingly the married woman who has a lover on the side and also places her sights on a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good as Miles. Miss Fontaine did her part to perfection - at the same time she was clever, calculating, innocent, frightened and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull it away. Joan Fontaine looked amazing in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
