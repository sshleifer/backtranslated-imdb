As my family's story goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the band, my father practiced with him for hours. So at one point my father Sinatra told me he was actually good at being tied to such a small group (band) and that he should venture himself. At that time, Sinatra had enough credits "under his belt" to do just that! Dorsey has never forgiven my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some pictures and records in that direction, as do Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every Sinatra movie more than I want to say, and his movie never gets old. . .
