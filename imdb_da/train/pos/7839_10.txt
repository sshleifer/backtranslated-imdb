The hood of critics at the time, but loved by the fans, this movie has now become a classic. Among seemingly "surreal" footage at John Lennon's home, among other places with live images of Marc Bolan & T.Rex at best, this movie is not only a must for anyone who likes Marc Bolan but provides a fascinating insight into the era . <br /> <br /> These were the times when Marc was hobbling with Ringo Starr from the Beatles [who directed it] and you could even find a short spot from a Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing the ivories in a fantastic [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children Of Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also great scenes with Chelita Secunda [said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter, etc.], Mickey Finn and even the actress of Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, sits down over the leg in front of a strict section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as. get it on and the slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended !! Five stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
