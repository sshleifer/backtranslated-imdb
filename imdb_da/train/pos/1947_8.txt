SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt the end was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to see the crew adjust to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the authors anticipated this problem by "reading" some Voyager on the Earth's sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that timeline has been eradicated, so that's all.) I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans we get our cake and eat it, because Janeway both have the ultimate victim and live on. I admit that Janeway's scenes and her older ones had conversations were bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) pulled it out.
