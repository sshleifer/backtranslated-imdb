I'm probably one of the greatest Nancy Drew fans out there. I've read every book three times, and I've played many of the Nancy cartoon games. I loved this movie. It kept you entertained the whole time you looked at it. I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone LOVED it. There were three women behind us who seemed to be in their late 30s to the early 40s, and I asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! So you see it will be an entertainment for all ages. Just give it a try. And it also teaches a lesson, just be yourself, even though everyone around you is the same. So in general, this step was huge. I'll see it once now! So stop bashing it please. It's a great movie!
