Sandra Bernhard is quite character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth. She started as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s, but her big break came in 1983 when staring opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, "Comedy King". Her film career, however, never went completely away. She made a few strange but entertaining pictures, such as the "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you, I'm nothing" undoubtedly is her best bet. It's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show that made her a superstar ?? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and scenic scenes, Sandra from Nina Simone turns to Diana Ross, speaks of childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and performs songs famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich made Sandra make a 90-minute tour-the-force performance that is both sexy and unique fun. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't miss this movie; It is also a tribute to her (odd) beauty with her extremely unconventional comedienne talent. And it has affected filmmakers in their work ?? For example, "Hedwig and the evil inch" would look very different if "without you I am something" did not exist.
