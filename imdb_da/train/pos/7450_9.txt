This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high-quality "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly cityists are broad-quality comedy help, and Eve Arden is the personification of the evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with Matthew Brodericks Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, though I'm not sure I liked "ladybug" characterization with some lines. Steve Martin's comedy help as Royal Orchestra Conductor is characteristic of Martin, but a little misplaced in the show's flow. As is usual with the series, there are several crazy comments thrown in for the older children (aged 15 and over). With a few small hops, the show flows well and they happily live ever. Children up to the age of 8 will continue to see it after the parents finally get tired of it - I found 3 times in a day to be a little too much.
