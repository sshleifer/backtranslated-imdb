A critical and financial flop once released, critics have turned around and stated that this film is the director's best. A La Ronde-like feeling of the film evolves rapidly as the boys of a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) persu, fall in and out of love with some of the most ornate and beautiful women watching movies (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was ad-libbed or rewritten on the recording day, giving the film a soft feel. Ben Gazzara is excellent as the main detective, demanding Audrey Hepburn after beating singer Colleen Camp and watching cab driver Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter inefficiently follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has a couple of girls he chases (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some amazing performances by a supurb cast. Standouts are Audrey Hepburn (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspirational choice for a romantic lead) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer Christy Miller. She is a pleasure to see as she burns out of her lines in a delivery of rat-a-tat-tat. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
