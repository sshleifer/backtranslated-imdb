The first hour or so in the movie was mostly boring to say the least. But it improved afterwards when Valentine Party began. Aside from the turn of the killer's identity at the end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and it was also the very first scene ("twist"). In these scenes, there was some real excitement and excitement, and the hot killer scene had an unpleasant (the way the scarecrows were) edge to it. The previous murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.
