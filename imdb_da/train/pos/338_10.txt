I watched this movie at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, who are all lively and incredible New Yorkers. The film's title in Amsterdam was Keep the river on your right, which makes the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. Equally important was the loving - and homosexual relationship Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion of nearly 80 years and inevitable forgiveness was very moving. I can only highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
