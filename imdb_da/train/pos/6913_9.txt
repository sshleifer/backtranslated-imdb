As a community theater actor who works hard at it but does not take action too seriously, I am always entertained by those who treat it as Great Art. This movie speaks "Actor's Craft" mercilessly while you discover a lot of good laughs. An actor on site for a movie is similar to the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of life" by the neo-Nazi leader of the secret service. He plays it to the hilt, causes the dictator's boyfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and changes the tables of his hunters beautifully. <br /> <br /> Lots of great shtick by the leaders, lots of good work by some unknown support actors, especially the housekeepers and two members of the palace guard, and funny little comos are teeming. Sammy Davis Jr. Make himself aware, Jonathan Winters plays a half-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and above all Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, but it has lots of beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous script and good actors do their thing and look as though they are actually having fun and not going through it usual existential anxiety about what is only play-acting!
