"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not at the level of "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many amazing moments. Basically, it follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have normal lives and go to school, living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms. The mood and animation of this show is much like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in an episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good it has fun parts. Some of the songs are good, others not much, but I like this show. The funniest character is the father of Brak. (it's a human, no one knows why)
