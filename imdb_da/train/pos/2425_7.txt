I caught this movie at the IFC and I enjoyed it, even though I felt the editing job was a bit rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be a bit of a nonlinear plot presentation in Pulp Fiction style. However, it seemed a little forced. I definitely think the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have used a little clearing up. Some scenes do not seem to make sense to others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the score here as low as it is. It is not outstanding, but it has no serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The movie at least showed that Laurence Fishburne can act whenever he wants. They just have told him they are not in the Matrix movies.
