Scripture example of an undervalued film. Although you can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it is still considered another fun picture. And even though the film has inspired many and added it's quotes and pictures to all of its viewers, Moon Over Parador has still not received the recognition it should. Even the brilliant cast of Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to name one, is unable to change that view. <br /> <br /> But having seen Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann, Richard Dreyfus makes an offer he can't deny in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part he once played one can only come to a conclusion: these things are timeless! For fifty years we have the proof.
