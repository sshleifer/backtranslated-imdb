Absolutely fantastic waste .... this one has it all: nudity, good fighting scenes, doing, actions, explosions, etc. It also originates the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga becomes Ingrid later in the film (you will have to see it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into history as it is too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - see the towel stealing stage to see what I mean. The battle scenes were at once quite good and so spoiled by some really shabby effects that looked like they were made by the team that made the City of the Walking Dead (ie, strangely colored blood rubbing out of the neck). <br /> <br /> I would advise fans of low budget waste to check it out if they can track a copy - it is pretty rare and I could never see anyone bothering the re-release so it gets rarer in a few years . <br /> <br /> Anyway I'd recommend it exclusively to Belinda Mayne's big nude scenes! The lady is a fox!
