POSSIBLE SPOILER - In one way or another "How to Alienate Friends ...." is "the loser learns to adjust, becomes successful and finds out something else means more" type of story that lies in the celebrity industry. - SPOILER'S END <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book, but this comedy delivers more good moments. Even though I think the ending is flawless. It felt too fast and too sudden, as if something was missing. Besides, I would say that the film is not capable of keeping a high level. Apart from this, you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities. Until now I have never seen Pegg anything different. Still, he is a very unique type, although sometimes he may seem a little more boring than necessary. Fox turned out to be able to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds. Don't know if it was hard to do, but her performance was hot and much better than under "Transformers" (okay ... probably it's not a tough fight). Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you like it (as I do) or find it annoying. On the other hand, you will see Anderson who has proven his play and Jeff Bridges (which is fine, but perhaps he might have a little more powerful). They fit everyone with their character well enough. Conclusion: I think it is a lovely celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages, a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending.
