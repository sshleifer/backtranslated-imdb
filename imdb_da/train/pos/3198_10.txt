That's how I felt while watching this movie. I loved it. It was fun. But I felt like I was getting stealthy views of a person's psyche and then laughed as it was twisted around to make an interesting point. A friend puts it this way: <br /> <br /> "I want to break into someone else's house and now watch their horrible home videos without their knowledge". <br /> <br /> Another of these facts is alien to fiction films. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town guy coming up at a nearby television station hoping to come to the movies - and he does, but not, perhaps, as he originally did expected. With great hopes of fame and meaning, he invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent search he has organized in his hometown - highlighted by his own "Olivia Newton-Don" mission. <br /> <br /> Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some images of an uncomfortable child who wants to be someone morphs over two subsequent interpretations in the history of freedom from oppressed sexual identity in small-town America. Harris also criticizes the attitudes of small-town America, the cult of celebrity and the practice of film and television. <br /> <br /> Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out better results. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so close he follows the actual 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the feel of the interaction that Harris wants it to go. <br /> <br /> In the end, the wide-eyed naivety of the original Gary is what moved me - unlike these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie not to be missed. I haven't seen anything else like that. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
