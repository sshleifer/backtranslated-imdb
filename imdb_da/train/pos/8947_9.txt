Kim Novak is a prowl witch for a deadly girlfriend, and James Stewart is her choice. Scintillating comedy of manners, from the Broadway scene; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and performed by a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually disheveled writer Redlitch. I love this movie, though few others seem to. Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 movie from 1958.
