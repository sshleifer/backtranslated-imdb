I'm glad this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style of thumb flames and constant loud sounds. Essentially, if you have a short attention phase or lack white and imagination to engage with literary narration, you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately it is rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a great job of successfully completing the story of Catherine Storr's novel "Marianne Dreams" successfully for a manuscript. An inevitable task that anyone who has seen a movie in a book will no doubt know. <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent so director Bernard Rose can use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they indulge in the actors' craft! I know actors do their job and act instead of resorting to scary on the lens of the camera, if a kaleidoscope of bills, explosions and firefighting breaks out around them is a really rare treat, but it actually happens in this movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the last reason that this is a movie for the imaginative thinker and not the rogue tabloid reader. Apart from a solid script, direction and action, it depends on atmosphere, excitement and implied horror. If it is to be categorized as horror, the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in Sophocles' vein than Tobe Hooper. In conclusion, you can say that if you like lots of loud sounds, explosions, constant cuts and bright flashing colors, you'd rather see "Transformers", but if you like an exciting story unfolding through a skilled And the evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence with power to feed you cacophonous nonsense, then it can only be your thing.
