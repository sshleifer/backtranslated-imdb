This was a great movie but it had the worst end I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and showed wonderful talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpecting, which is what made it entertaining. As good as the movie was, the whole movie is judged at the end, which was terrible! Perhaps a successor could eliminate this bad ending.
