Being semi-Portuguese does not give me half-blind (or half-prejudice) when discussing Portuguese films. Not that I'm going to do it very often anyway. But this movie was so busy with adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went / goes - but it didn't take a blow on venturing beyond the usual Portuguese movie area: things like using real places in the midst of busy Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd for the real crowd almost 30 years ago. And by God they got it right! Ok, to sum it up: Very emotional if you've lived through it, but you'll see little improvements that could have been made as well as plotting necessities that were. If you just see it randomly, you are in favor of a good historical body, only of the very recent History kind and a little more thoughtful than normal. Even by European standards, yes.
