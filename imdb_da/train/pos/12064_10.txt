"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the most embarrassing British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, having arrived in a small town to deal with a dead client's property, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frighten is calculated for and delivers the maximum power possible. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the final is quite disruptive. The action is excellent and the excitement is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a really horrible horror movie this gives a look. I dare to see "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
