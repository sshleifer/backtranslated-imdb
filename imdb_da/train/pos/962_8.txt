I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was so impressed. Everything about it was amazing. The actors, the story. A trustworthy child who grew into brave, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I couldn't take my eyes off this movie for fear of missing anything. It is the prefect factory / story with morals, sweet and scary sprites and "monsters", but still heart-rending folk music. A child came and bullied in school, which became a hero. Picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a trip to Goblin Mountain where he discovers Yokai, who is great creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his off sides certainly needed a hug. These evil people catch Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and these are reported in a terribly violent robotic monster whose only job is to kill. Takashi a young boy is the one to be their savior along with a red man / draw a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that if it had been America, they could have made it a dingy toy and sold it at all good toy stores. The lines are good especially do not try this home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. Suspend faith and see this with a child or alone and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a little bit sad. And not necessarily that. Cheers Furdion
