I stumbled upon this late last night n TCM. <br /> <br /> Hadn't seen it since it came out originally but had never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> I had totally forgotten how beautiful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, your for Shelly Winters before she balooned out. <br /> <br /> However, Ronald Coleman was the ultimate state actor of his time - I had read Othello in high school English - and HED it. After seeing "a double life", I read it again and finally understood what the play was about. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Rabbit writing team was at its peak when this script was done - <br /> <br /> A movie worth remembering and rewatching
