All dogs Go to heaven playing the cat criminal underworld. The film is a pleasure for children with a comical and dark but satisfying and relaxing story with lots of singing and dancing. It has abolished Charlie, a chamber criminal who is murdered, but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him, and through this relationship he understands the importance of life and self-sacrifice. This is a sweet animation much loved by my eyes as a child. I would highly recommend this movie to kids. I am unsure how adults would react to it. (I tried to see it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings don't last long, do they?)
