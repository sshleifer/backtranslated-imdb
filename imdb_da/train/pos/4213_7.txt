Director Samuel Fuller confronts a brilliant visual setup: The Cocky pickpocket unconsciously lifts some microfilm from a woman's bag; It turns out that she is a courier for the Communists, and now she and the Count are being watched by the police. Film Noir Formula is all its glory - before the ingredients became clich√©s - including the waterfront sites, floozies, saxophones on the sound track and a hell of a climax fights. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are on target and the clear, crisp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the knockout support role as a "professional stoolie". Exciting, atmospheric, hard like nails. *** from ****
