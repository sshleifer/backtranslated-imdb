I've been waiting for such an original image like this for some time now. Brokedown Palace has the `hard to believe 'aspect, though with the ingenious instruction and manuscript, ?? Palace scores big. <br /> <br /> I really never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I will tell you what she really changed with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on holiday to Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he neglected to inform them that they would carry an indecent amount of drugs to him. Well, in the end they get caught and end up in a Thailand prison. I know how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of medicine? Well, if you can get at the one little miscue, you'll find a very well written and acted story. Recently, I have found myself being drawn into the movies in the movies I see and developing a personal feeling for the characters I see. This movie is no different. At the end of the movie I found myself more caring for her than any of the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer living in Thailand, specializing in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers with an excellent performance and binds the film together beautifully. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of turns that at the end of the movie have you in tears. This is one of the movies you've probably passed when searching for that movie to watch at home. It is my opinion that next time in the video store, do not pass this again.
