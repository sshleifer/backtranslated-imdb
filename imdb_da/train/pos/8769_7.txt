Gentleman Jim is another case of writing the legend where Errol Flynn plays the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a tasty entertainment that barely stops the weather. It is just as pointless to see historical accuracy here as it is in Flynns Lighting for the Light Brigade - this is pure hokum with all stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly sumptuous scale and given a real sense of energy by Raoul Walsh's living direction. Flynn is still at the height of his power (you'll never guess he's had a mild heart attack during production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and eternal sidekick Alan Hale with good time, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick tasks this time). In fact, even the pirate gallon from Flynn's former movie makes a somewhat outgoing cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes just breeze by.
