It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a "therapy" for me with a personal experience. <br /> <br /> A thirty-year-old man claps over a high school baseball game where he "missed the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if I only wanted to hit that ball" and how his life would be better because of it. Then he gets a chance to find out .... and gets a little more than he negotiated for. It reminds me so much when I was in high school, I tried twice for our drill / dance team and did not. This team was the closest thing to a sorrow in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that". I did not try until my last two years of HS, and after the second time I took it very hard. I had hit and spotted my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bladder and that didn't make me do it. It was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even now sometimes, I think, "If I just didn't hit my leg, I'd never have worn the stupid tights." Now I am not sitting and thinking that my life would be better or even different if I had, but when I saw this movie, I realized that we never really know how different things can be by change a little thing far back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has one moment in the past, they wish they could change. Be careful what you want !!!
