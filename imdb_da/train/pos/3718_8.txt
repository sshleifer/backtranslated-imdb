It was a good movie. It wasn't your typical war girl, but something a little different. This movie showed us recruiting in pre-war training and not actually fighting for a war. This film is one of the more realistic views of war and the army than most other films like this one made. Colin Farrel did a good job of portraying a gunman and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis reasonably contributed. Seeing Colin Farrel move from class B to class in a few years, you would never think it would happen. I would also add that the tiger landscapes did a good job of filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. It is good to see talent used wisely and I hope to see the same talent again in the near future.
