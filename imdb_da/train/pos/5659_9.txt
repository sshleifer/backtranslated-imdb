AG was an excellent presentation of drama, excitement and thriller that is so rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the will. We rooted for Caleb as he sought to resist Sherlock Lucas overtures. We were overwhelmed and fearful of learning from the unthinkable connection between these two signs. The manipulations that gave rise every week to fear what Lucas would do next were really surprising. This show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in ways that American entertainment so rarely tried, much less mastered. The suits have certainly made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show is ashamed of the current glut of "reality" shows - which is so less than satisfying. The call to a DVD box set is well based. This show is quality view for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. An audience who is tiring with over-saturation of mind-numbing reality danger will offer this gem of true storytelling. Take the DVD box!
