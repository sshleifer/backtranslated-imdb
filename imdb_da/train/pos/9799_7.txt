A fun Batman animated movie. Not on a par with "Return of the Joker" or "Phantasmask", but solid yet. I liked how the movie kept you guessing who Batwoman was. There was nice twisting. Nice action sequences. I have always been of the opinion that the Batman comics are better, as some of the pitiful Batman live action movie sequels. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
