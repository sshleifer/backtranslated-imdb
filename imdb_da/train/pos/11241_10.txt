I've acquired this, one of my all-time favorite movies on DVD recently and, as usual, while viewing, the whole thing struck me away. <br /> <br /> I'm a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie just has me in tears, especially "Do you" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This judges second best to Quadrophenia (like also star Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> An amazing soundtrack and stunning view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80s where I grew up. The end is so sad, for hours after the end of the movie I am like a blubbering baby. <br /> <br /> I expect to carry this DVD out of repeat viewing, I can see it again and again and never get bored just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad's treasure. God bless you all. xx
