Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can say about it. They are four of the most underrated biz actors and they work beautifully together. It's like poetry in the way they play each other and decorate the natural ability to seem like they were best friends for eons to shoot the movie themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is fine, and one that can be quite intense to watch the first time, and the four stars greatly help to see again. I can't describe how good it was to watch Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey on the screen. The biggest moment is when they see a couple from a distance and fill the vowel themselves, it has almost got a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> A good movie, a great cast, go see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
