the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people. Presented in the most sublime way and certainly touching your heart. A rare combination where the successor transcends prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions. the film re confirms your belief in love and pain by separation. The joy of seeing your most beloved is unsurpassed and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that give the film a pure joy and love to see. A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic (at least one of them) movies of all time.
