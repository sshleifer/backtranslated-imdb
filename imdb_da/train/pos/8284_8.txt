This is one of the unique horror movies that requires a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" for it to be appreciated. The most important people may not realize that this story is told through a little boy, and as with most younger children, he is easily scared. Mainly because he simply does not understand things, just as why his father is almost never there for him. From watching the movie you can see the man arguing with his wife the balance between working time and family time, and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not. One can also imagine that the boy is afraid of the forest as it is established early in the film that the family is from the city. Also in the beginning, when the family travels to the house, they hit a deer, then they are kept up, so they argue with the local people about it, and the little boy probably did not find this introduction to the forest pleasant. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is ultimately what his young innocent minds produce to explain all this. There is the American Indian legend, but when you look at the scene where the young boy hears about it, it is explained to him equally and simply. Not because that's what Wendigo really is, but because that's how he understands it. Looking at the movie from this point of view, one can really start to appreciate it. It was of course low budget and cheap cheap, but jumping assembly, use of light and general creepy more than make up for it. And the last question the film asks is: is it all in your head or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> Rated R: Profanity, violence and a sex scene
