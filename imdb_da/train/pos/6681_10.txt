This movie deserved better It is really fun, has some wonderful jokes and synagogues, some things for "Geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are actually effective. Seeing Paul Reuben's speed in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I have never read the comic book series before I saw the movie, but have the page. As good as they are, I still recommend the MM movie. (Although the flaming carrot as a sign would have been cool) Greg Kinnear is great ... great as Captain Amazing, and no one else could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like she has ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. Buy this movie! It's just 5 bucks and some changes at your local Wal-Mart. You want to thank me. You really want to. Oh, and Mrs Garafolo is in it. IT ALL makes it vague
