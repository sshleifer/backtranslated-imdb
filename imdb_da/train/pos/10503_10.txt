When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were great for their time, a good plot, good courses and above all, the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the plot altogether, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario has to save her. The game is to get 120 stars from the bans in the castle. Each had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are sections of the castle, where you can get more stars. But of course you've beaten Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Let's start with characters.Mario is the main character and gets useful advice from Toad, so he's basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. The biggest villain is Bowser, and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba.The characters are really good. Next, what about graphics? People say Gameplay is more important than the graphics, and I totally agree. But with his big plot there is great graphics. Especially for it's time. I have a whole lot of other Nintendo games like 007, and their graphics don't compare to Super Mario.Bright colors, amazing effects and great sound effects. I found the graphics in the streams very good. Below Bowser World, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now is the music. This is my favorite part of the game. When I played this at a young age, I'd like to leave the game all night so the music would put me to bed. Especially the music from Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others who are also good, especially in the world once again with Bowser, are the ones who keep the most with me and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite time as a developing gamer and I love it. This game becomes 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO GAME GAME!
