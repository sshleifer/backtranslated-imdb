I have never seen this program before, but it was highly recommended by members of my family. I found my boyfriend in Hadfield (the movie theater) and she pointed out a couple of landmarks when I first visited. <br /> <br /> This got my interest, so I bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch. Besides recognizing some of the sites, I found myself not least surprised. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world. TLOG easily sits up there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as the best. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say I'm hooked on the program now. The characters are amazing and show exceptional depth while maintaining a scarily realistic edge. The look of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no respect for Hadfield, which I have found a very welcoming and warm place). I only hope it continues its originality during its race (which is based on the 2nd series ending its return in Britain last night, it is certain). Well done BBC !!
