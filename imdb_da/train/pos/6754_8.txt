Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir: Where the pavement ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected twists and smart dialogue, and an eye-catching look with beautiful camera movements and dark and greedy film noir lighting. Dana Andrew's stars as Detective Mark Dixon, subordinate and part policeman who has a reputation for being too physically tough with criminals. After a case, Dixon looks in search of suspects and answers, he becomes much more involved than he would. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in his role - hard and edgy, Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock everyone off their heels if they come on his bad side. He's the perfect movie noir anti-hero - he's not that good all the time, but we still root for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role as much as Dixon's sweet shoulder. There may not be too much for Tierney's role, but she certainly goes beyond what others can do with the role, knocking each member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle way and glimpse into the eye. The support molding is also not bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, goes in and gives a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Cave Ends is no Laura, but it is a fantastic movie noir filled with great characters, history and image.
