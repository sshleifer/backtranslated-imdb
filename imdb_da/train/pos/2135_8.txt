To dance is an excellent movie because it shows how something like dance can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. Dance is seen as the existence of existence and the individual's birth. That is certainly the case with Aoki. At work, he is a humble office denizen, but places him on the dance floor, and all his drained intensity is released. Surprisingly, this release is frowned upon in Japan because of the rigid culture of conformity. At the beginning of the movie, all the characters are ashamed or scare their desire to dance. They will be despised or considered perverted to express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.
