Although not necessarily a so-called "classic" movie by today's standards, it is still worth seeing. The main reason for this is that after you have experienced this movie, you get the feeling that you have also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s, no matter how good or bad you are. <br /> <br /> I happened to watch this movie in an English literary class at SUNY Geneseo, and although it initially seems to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons, the movie is far from be "thrown together". My point is that if you leave the movie feeling dissatisfied and confused, the movie has done the job: it delivers a desolate future vision that gives you the feeling of uncertainty and anger. It was perhaps the same feeling that the film was trying to explore in the youth it exemplified. As such, "Zabriskie Point" cannot tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its signs can be one-sided and predictable. But it also gives so good this kind of clich√©, rebellious desire to get out of the existence that both Mark and Daria have to share. Even the anti-establishment students are as unauthorized as the gov't they rebel against.
