The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really, this episode is the same content as the DVD pilot release. That said, episode 01 provides a very substantial background for the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both original and 2007 remake). This is most important for the 2007 series. Like the trending plot of sci-fi too late, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. In addition, we get a lot of background on the Adama family line as well as their relationship with the unaudited (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode is about the popular topic "Virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colonies and Cylon's birth. <br /> <br /> Overall I enjoyed this episode. Although it was not new material for myself or anyone who has already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot, the series looks very promising. As is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff hanger so as to ensure the success of an audience (sci-fi community). I will definitely keep an eye on determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
