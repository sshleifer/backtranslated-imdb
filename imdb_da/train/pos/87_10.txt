This Oscar-award-winning short film can be among the greatest of the genre. Speaking completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat for a young boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly places him in a bowl, then goes to school, leaves the goldfish unprotected and a window carelessly open. After a while, a neighbor's orange tabby comes in, coming in through the window and heads slowly to the bowl. The fish apparently knows that something is going on and becomes very tense. As the cat comes very close to the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat catches the fish, drops him back into the bowl and goes out the window he came in, just as the boy did not know what happened, coming back. This was incredibly filmed with real animals; How Cousteau made these animals behave in this way is remarkable. I only wish this movie was available now for people to see; I first saw it in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable.
