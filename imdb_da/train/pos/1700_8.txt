I loved this movie. You have to respect midgets who dressed like little martians. Sure the story might have been thin at times, but you can't get away from the way it was done. I used to see this again and again when I was 8. It's a kids movie, and besides, it has some of the greatest quotes ever. The Blanze's "Home on the Range" reproduction is amazing. <br /> <br /> Very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
