_ Read Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose career is slowly less active than they used to be, but a great tribute to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this movie, where most of them Famous actors play their own Role (not being mixed with living their lives in front of the camera - the movie is not voyeur) is rather vague and follows the actors in series of episodes that make the movie quite entertaining. When Andr√© Dussolier finishes the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his role (great actress, she is fun serious, especially when in Dussolier's role she battles herself), actors run in the streets and ask for autographs like fighting and gossip , we recognize pastiche of other scenes where each (or others) have played. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most are at least in the 50s) or do not know French cinema, this movie has less interest, as most of the references will be missed but it will still give a good trace of reflection on aging, to act on public life ...
