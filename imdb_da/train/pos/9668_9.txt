This is a small movie, few characters, theatrical. And yet there is something about Ireland that you do not find anywhere else. This movie is IRELAND. In all, it's grubiness, it's sadness, it's self-pity. Boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and above all Madge. I know them. I'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad story and they are our present.
