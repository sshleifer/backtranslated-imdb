This movie, while apparently based on a movie of the same title in 1951 published by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox, one down on his luck baseball manager with a brief mood to life. As for this movie being "stacked" about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and shows up in his screenplays, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (third rock of the sun), Brenda Fricker (a charming and well-spiced Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, even he is good at this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be as crucial in this movie, but he got exposure) Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except Dazed and Confused), some amazing character actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass ) and an experienced veteran in one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast do a good job plus a great story that promises a lot of beauty someone I don't care Ad with which depressions of depression you are in. I loved this movie as a child and it brings back memories when I see it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to any parent looking for something their children haven't seen, and everyone else, for that matter.
