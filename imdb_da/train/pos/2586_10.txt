The characters were vibrant and interesting, the plot was excellent, the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished, and it takes a basic love triangle story and throws in a science-fiction element into it. I could identify with many of the characters, and their motivations made logical rational sense within the framework of history. <br /> <br /> The camera work was fantastic, clear and precise, the background music perfectly chosen for effect, the singing firefighters a great talented memorable oddity, the brilliantly set sets and the special effects performed with a talented talent. I'm a bit surprised how a whole mini-carnival in a chain store's parking could be powered by a single lamp outlet. It seems impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers at the end of the film was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was also a wonderful touch that played the bleak role as a carny very good.
