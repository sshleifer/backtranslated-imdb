I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like these are never shown during prime time. I have to say that this is one of the best serious movies ever to outline the difference between the Hong Kong peoples and the Chinese on the mainland. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but can only get better when HK teaches Mandarin. It also showed me how there is indie rock scene in mainland China and that the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and make the house funky! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely fantastic, with his clean and crisp voice, honest action and a total chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who don't know much about Asian people cleaning themselves off the typical western stereotypes, and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema like myself. Check it out!
