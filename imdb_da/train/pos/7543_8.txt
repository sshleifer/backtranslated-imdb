This is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. which dialogue exists, appears in word balloons as it would in manga. Plot of this is existing but only vaguely calculated. there is a question about the manga, as this is based in English in the blast books collection, 'comics underground japan', and it has an actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend checking that volume if you liked it, as it explains some of the movie's "plot", which is otherwise unclear. animation wise this is pretty decent, good accidental use of computers and the images are mostly realized well. It jumps in and out of episodes as the characters, a cat and his brain-dead older sister cats wander in and out of a series of odd pictures: a boat, a circus, a desert. In just half an hour they go through a series of semi-plots and settings, which makes me think that the director chose a number of problems with the long-standing manga to adapt randomly, but primarily chosen visually. Knowing what is going on may increase understanding. this reminds me of most of the kinds of things they used to play on the mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially a card that has a cat chasing a man's shielded bar around the house. only in this case cats hello kitty look more and their adventure is extended to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [although it is not so easy to tell what is going on]. The DVD here has the director's comments and a "making of" features, but I can't comment on them because I didn't get around to them. I give this a 8/10 for now, here is not much to compare it with in anime and I hope for more like this.
