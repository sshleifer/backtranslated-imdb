I caught this at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was in Awe over the absolute power this movie has. It is a study of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers entering the military with the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as being taken care of by our government for it. The film describes the psychological changes that take place in boot camp as the soldiers become "killing for their country" and embark on the war and aftermath when returning home. It also depicts the effect that killing has on the human psyche. It praises the soldiers and never criticizes the soldiers as opposed to other films, instead criticizing a system that is not prepared and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This movie is powerful, moving, emotional and thoughtful. It stands as a call to arms to support our troops, not just by buying stickers and going to parades, but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in their health and well-being is taken care of after The killings have ended. <br /> <br /> The best movie from the festival so far, **** / ****
