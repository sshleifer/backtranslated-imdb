It is no criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are in our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Winter Soldier, and Ground Truth was like seeing a remake or successor - except it was about Iraq instead of Vietnam. Like Winter Soldier because of his one-sided message, both films illustrate how gratifying we are to engage in conflicts based on false predictions, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to carry the wave of this greedy war surplus. Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the youths and the willingness to make them effective killers, but the training is tremendously lacking in teaching the diplomatic and police skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they allegedly are struggling for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and will probably also lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so unilateral that it could easily go as a left wing propaganda. Not by me, remember you, but by those who aim to discredit the movie and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a larger audience.
