One of the all-time great science fiction works as a visionary and thoughtful as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he's outdated by Pitts incredibly frenetic swing, which is unlike anything he has ever done before. Even Stowe is not out of her league here. The story is very layered and offers a lot to think about. The climatic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are scary and yet so fun in their own way. Lots of dark humor on display here. Fantastic production design and appropriate bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.
