I haven't seen this movie this year, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this movie is twice the movie of Braveheart. It is simply more realistic and has more credible signs. Ridb Roy looks as if you could imagine Rob Roy looking, messy hair and beard with simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic look about him, looks like a shot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that regrets some people, but compares him to Mel Gibson and William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a man whose legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant, while Gibson is nearly a foot shorter. The story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. Sound something like Braveheart? But instead of a movie that cries "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get a film that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting movie. Much like gladiator. Cast is amazing and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this effort. The story is amazing about how it is about heroism and humanity. The scene where Maria is raped and she goes out of the burning house with a look at true Scottish strength is followed by she washing the sperm from her branch in an extreme panic. This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do. Overall, this is a fantastic and almost flawless watch. Go see it!
