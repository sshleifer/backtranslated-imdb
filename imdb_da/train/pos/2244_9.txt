The only explanation I can muster why this movie isn't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some. This movie was a real happy surprise, satire is genius. This movie turns on the lights of darkness, which are organized religion and large media, and roaches scurry for cover. Rent the DVD and watch it yourself, if you have not yet, this movie succeeds in how many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to brush the nose under the tent, both by using humor and very clever analogies combined with tell backgrounds and places. Cannot comment in depth without revealing any significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this movie that even the spicy movie cuff will be captured by.
