Saving Grace is a great movie with its heart in the right place. Grace is recently a widow and understands that her late husband left her with many debts. She could lose her lovely house and see no other solution to her misery than to start marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers will love to live, and the villagers are all wonderful people that most viewers will love to have as neighbors. There is only one thing wrong with this image, and that is the way it portrays the effect of marijuana on its user. It is obvious that none of the actors or authors of this movie have ever smoked things. The way the villagers act to smoke a common is ridiculous and probably just fun. It is precisely in these scenes that white is replaced by English slapstick and it is a shame in a movie that is nevertheless very fun.
