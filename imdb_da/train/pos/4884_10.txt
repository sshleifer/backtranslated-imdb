For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the defining time in their lives, and what followed could never be compared. As the film opens, a newly widowed but still lively woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician gamely trying to play the classic song, "Stardust." This is reminiscent of her reminiscences of when she played in an almost all-girl band that entertained between bomb raids during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench's character meet and decide to reunite the band, taking them on a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band is recreated and provides a successful resume. <br /> <br /> The film is exquisitely written and discreet, with excellent performances from everyone involved. The characters are well-developed and all people who have not interrupted their lives, despite their years. And there is all the lovely old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, yet a serious movie. The war hit everyone, and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.
