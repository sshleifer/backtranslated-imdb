You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, constantly shoots in the foot with all those stupid comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy" who bombarded when it came out but is now a cool classic ). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "Night Listener", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best works, period. <br /> <br /> This is a very chilling story, though it does not contain a serial killer or anyone physically dangerous for that matter. The film's concept is based on an actual case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered from horrific abuse and ultimately constituted AIDS. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson might not exist. When I watched this movie, they again gave confused emotions, which Robin Williams portrayed so brilliantly, in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette also probably gives his best dramatic performance as the ultimate sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was far from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There was just time she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring straight at me. It takes a good actress to play that kind of role and it is this underrated (yet well-considered) role that makes Toni Collette one of the best actresses of this generation, not to have been nominated for an Academy Award (from 2008 ). It is amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark movie that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be disturbed because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
