This makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on television. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the lovely Reece Shearsmith. Completely undervalued, this is horror-comedy perfection. The characters are iconic and catchphrases bizarre, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone should simply see. <br /> <br /> The best thing about gentleman's league is that it's always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It doesn't have to rely on catchphrases (as opposed to Little Britain) to be fun. The fact that the league is willing to kill off possibly their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they have steel balls.
