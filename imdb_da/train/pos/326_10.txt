"I'm curious? Yellow" is very fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was laughing out loud on several occasions. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, exploratory. Don't expect Bergman here. This film is about a youth in the early to mid-60s in Sweden and on the topics, read * contradictions *, which the nation and the world are facing. At times, Yellow seems to be a serious social policy documentary, with Lena, the protagonist and others interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (eg Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. Still, Yellow seems like a personal documentary that explores Lena's life - her homeland, her love, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person ?? complex, flawless, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And above all this is the wonderful extra dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documents himself to document Lena. That's what really gives me yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly arise in some very fun times and in some fun ways that remind the viewer that this is fiction and artwork, but their presence is in itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves by filming themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video with the same quality ?? a music video about the production of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting more and more cartoon-like. I think Sjöman might have had something similar in mind. While "I am curious ?? Yellow" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient and authentic.
