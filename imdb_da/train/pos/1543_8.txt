I remember watching this movie many years ago, I believe BBC2. I'd love to see it again - does anyone know how to get a copy? As I remember it was a particularly powerful film, especially the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks. Apart from that, I really can't remember too much about the story - so I will see it again! I have trawled the net but can't find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS on this movie on the market. Will appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. Thank you in advance for your help. Yours sincerely, Albany234@googlemail.com
