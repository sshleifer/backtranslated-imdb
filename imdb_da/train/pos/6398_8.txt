"Inspirational" stories of "triumph of the human spirit" are usually great layoffs for me. The most surprising thing about MAND OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite myself. The movie is as predictable and clich√© as it gets, but it works. Much credit goes to the exciting ideas of both leaders. It's a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is wonderfully detained here. We have become accustomed to De Niro, and he does not disappoint. He creates a dark fun portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. out to make an old-fashioned flick and come up with a winner.
