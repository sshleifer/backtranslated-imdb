I didn't see this movie in the theater. I confess an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta making movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast this year when Travolta was so completely destroyed when he didn't win. How does he dare when there were "real" actors in the race? I'm sorry John, you should have won. After catching this movie on cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderfully done. I also admit that I never go past it when I can surf. I'll stop and see. Over the years, I have learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumb in my waist and learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the supervision of the soundtrack of some of the music from Urban Cowboy. "Looking for love" defines the movie, but Urban Cowboy was chock full of classics who didn't make it to the soundtrack. It should have been a double cd ........
