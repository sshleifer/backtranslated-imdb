"Read my lips" tells of a strange symbiosis that develops between a regular social maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace teacher, a raw ex-spouse (Casel). As the movie cools this unlikely duo down to their ids, they become involved in a chilling fusion of minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Good stuff for anyone for character-driven movies with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
