Vivacious & Irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES Brings Unlucky - For Happiness in the Life of a Lone Old Sister and Brother of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, a literary script and first-class performances give the story the exact touch of quality it deserves. <br /> <br /> With its professional name from the character she portrayed, actor Anne Shirley is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely changes the lives of her new guardians. Certainly in her lead, Miss Shirley is a pleasure, entertaining viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, quick temper and not so secret sorrows. Playing the choppy spinster that gives the girl home, Helen Westley also commands her role completely; the viewer will be delighted to see this sharp heavy woman slowly calling to Anne's love and child-like innocence. The Australian actress OP Heggie gives one of his finest performances as Westley's shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anne to his heart from the moment he gets to pick her up from the railway station. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown plays the most comfortable schoolteacher who quickly takes Anne's attention. Sara Haden is suitably stinging like a curious neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of her few moments as Avonleas doctor.
