I thought this movie was great. It was fun. The kid reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must see for any fan of 70s rock. (I hope I and my friends are not like that in twenty years!) Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off-kilter singer trying to regain the old spirit <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea fits Perfectly fit into the film as the glue tries to hold the band together, but it doesn't succeed well. <br /> <br /> If you love music and were ever in a band, this movie is for you. You will not regret watching this movie. I do not know. Even my family found it fun and that says something.
