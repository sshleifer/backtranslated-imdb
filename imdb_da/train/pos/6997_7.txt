One thing is for sure ... you shouldn't watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a sign to live with a sin that he cannot cope with. The story is the drop fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation, so it keeps you from wondering what's going on. Finally, dots are put together and the performance makes sense. All the signs were ok, and Wil Smith did another good day in the office. There is no doubt about many moral issues to be asked, but if you just accept and buy into his pain then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey you take is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie, which unfortunately gives you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the kind of thinking and not just the explosions and battles.
