I watched the movie list guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival where I went when I was in Hollywood that this movie was in screening. Basically, there is a choice for the new president of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society that comes up so you can imagine how much violence will happen during this. The battle is between "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for controlling the oldest and most powerful Triad parts of society. Also Louis Koo starring as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Only. There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments, almost enough action, except perhaps when the police are involved, but a sequel followed, so it's a pretty worthy crime drama thriller. Very good!
