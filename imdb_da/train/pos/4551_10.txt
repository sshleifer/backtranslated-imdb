I had never seen such an incredibly working job in a movie I did when I watched Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Brown in my left foot. In fact, from the scene, his role was not even over. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled as he all through the film of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his overall action had made. For me, it is remarkable and through all the pain he has set to act the role I think it is right to say that he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history. He was so masterful in this hard part that I think no one could have done better or more of an effect than him. Although I can't say it's the biggest movie all the time, I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then proceeded to act until it didn't even act any more, is undoubtedly the greatest feet I ever have have seen an actor do. Probably a man too for that matter.
