This film shows artificial film techniques where, instead of the landscape, the camera's attention is drawn to details of how someone expresses how the woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. How the man can be wearing a hat and stockings and shoes and underwear and both seem so comfortable and comfortable. How provocative the woman poses is another feature of the table that the instructor chooses to let us know that she is a free spirit sexually and is intended to have the pleasure she is seeking without flirting directly or with particular sensitivity to what the man can do feel. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open one where she does not hold back, does not feel particularly ashamed of how she behaved and wants to share these facts with him, because she is always always focusing on their marriage. Nothing, and no one can come between the two. Only the fate of fate can intervene --- his prison during the war and what follows after his return in the final instance. A very exciting film that is completely absorbent.
