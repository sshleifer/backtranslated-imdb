Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the cashier's office and, as a rule, dramatic and exciting talks about casino jobs, mafia score settlements and World War II battles, Verneuil could be considered to give us two fixed hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of his male actors: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he instructed Yves Montand. It is a strange static movie, which is mainly in offices and conference rooms that do not contain a chase scene and hardly any violence. <br /> <br /> Montand provides good performance if it is somewhat dry and is well supported by other players. I couldn't wonder what the Costa-Gavras could have done with this story based on the Z (Lambrakis murder) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
