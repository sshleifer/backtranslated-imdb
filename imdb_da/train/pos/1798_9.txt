So this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, it's a stick-to-your-bone movie - it's really been with me. Adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel, it is a dramatic return with full-fledged characters, thought-provoking rumor on life choices, and I do not exaggerate. one of the biggest casts ever assembled in 100+ years of film making. Wonderful work from everyone, led by a brilliant Vanessa Redgrave as a dying, counterfeit Newport matron, and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer is like Mama the real deal; Patrick Wilson resembles Paul Newman around 1958 and does not override the charm; and what a pleasure to see as good stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contribute with sharp, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not bring much edge to the somewhat clich√©d role of an unhappy rich waste, and family problems may be resolved more nicely than real life would allow. But it is a deliberately paced, visually beautiful meditation on real life problems, and you can cry on it and not feel that you are being manipulated with difficulty. Also what a sumptuous parade of the 1940s / 50s cars.
