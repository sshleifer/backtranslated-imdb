I think the history of history has been covered by other posters, so I just want to write about the influence this movie had on me. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie this year when it was released around 1987. My school arranged a trip to the cinema to see it, for a RE project I believe. We all went with course of excitement because we were on a school trip to the cinema! Little did we know what to experience. To this day, I still remember the feelings relied on in me, and I remembered crying much like most of my friends. I believe in age, we were that we found it shocking and quiet rightly angry in our own youthful way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement that year. I think it served the purpose in my case.
