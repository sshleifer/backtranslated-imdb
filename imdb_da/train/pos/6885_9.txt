It was surprised. . The impact and resolution of this film had, in my automatic way, responding to people and situations. The most alive was the stirring of the emotional song. Much like the way a spoiled child would be when responding to not getting their way. . . A temper tantrum if you want. Thinking I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous father of all. What did it cost me? Sooo much love. . so many blessings. Now I am present for how incredibly humble myself feel and have an ongoing attitude towards gratitude for life. . For what is happening at the moment, without my wild expectations of life being a certain way, the way I believe life or people should "be." This film has contributed to the freedom I now feel about connecting with others without limits and expectations. . .and connecting with true love. . . without fear of loss. . just love first and accept what love is given.
