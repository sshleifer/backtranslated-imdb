And my kids love it now! Granted, I can see it now and realize that the animation was not so great and that the plot is thin. Hi, if all the villagers introduced themselves by saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they can be laughed at, but for toddlers it is a moral story of catchy music. <br /> <br /> Music so captivating, remember that I still had the words hidden after not watching this movie in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this to younger children.
