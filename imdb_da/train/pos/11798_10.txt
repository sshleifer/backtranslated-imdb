I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's totally jam-packed with entertainment !!! Powers Boothe gives an excellent performance. As a fan of actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought that an actor could capture the intensity of Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie captures his best performance !!!
