This is a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. Gather 11 prominent international directors and award each one 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; Each card explores the global reverberation of 9/11. Without using any spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's piece is the jewel in the crown and Mira Nair's card (segment "India"), based on a true story, deserves to be made into a full movie. You also realize while looking at his brief why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? He is simply a master of the medium, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt," assumes the Arab attitude to the self-imposed collective guilt, which piece might have been the most interesting. He fails unlucky. Chahine's short is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among other superior chapters in the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I still want to give the film a 7/10 concept, if not for implementation.
