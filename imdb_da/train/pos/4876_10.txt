I do not know why some guys from the United States, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who didn't look at this movie - see it. Don't expect too much or set some frames just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people in Serbia DID really get married while Car Clinton bombs their villages, gypsies in every Balkan ALWAYS try to get you up in any way they can, Love is always unexpected, clean and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim this is a bad movie, I can only see that the Americans' sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than a clean, honest Balkan humorous love movie like Promise Me. The comment must be useful, and secondly, it should represent the author's personal image. I think the movie is great and people are watching it give their respect to the instructor and the story told inside. It's simple, but true. It is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh at death.
