Now this is where a family movie should be! There are few films from recent years that have been aimed at families or children who are truly worthy of their viewing publicly; But this is one of them. My whole family got away from the movie, marvelous, entertained, dazzled and happy. We still quote small anecdotes from here and there. The kids LOVED it and we did it (hubbie and I are 36 and 32 respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from the beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they can be and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you cannot empathize with. The personalities that bring these little creatures to life are well-crafted talents, combined with the skill and craftsmanship of some of Disney's best animators. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney himself. I think Mr. Disney would be warmly endorsed by this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their fellow heroines can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family leaving the theater that wants to watch again .. and buy to own video or DVD. I'm eager to see it again .. to get what I might have missed the first time. (Never have I seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before ... my daughter is still talking about little "dot".) <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, cordial, smart and good fun for the whole family!
