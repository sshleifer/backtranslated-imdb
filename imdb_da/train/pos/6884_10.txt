This miracle of a movie is one of the movies that has a lasting, long-term effect on you. I have read a review or two from angry people who I believe are either Republicans or children's brushes, and their extremist remarks talk about the power of the movies to confront people with their own darkest secrets. No such work of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before, and that is the film's miracle. The reality of the film and it's performance by Bret Carr, one must not miss. The very nature of it is almost interactive effect, will make people leave the theater either liberated or questioned their very identity. Bravo at the next level of cinema.
