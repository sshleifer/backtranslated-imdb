Okay, in the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - the lonely one who is persistently followed by comic relief. Then it develops into something really convincing when the cock is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie that has moments that I agree that it's a little too dramatic for kids to see (Manny's past, for example). The premise has obviously been working for a long time, so they can succeed in making a film set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It is a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotionally out of it. As I said, it can be tearing sometimes so the kids are warned. The right letdown is the animation. This was not as soup as the toy movie or shrek, and it shows. The people are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of CGI in the past. But don't let this stain record: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will bring together many fans, I have no doubt. Oh yes, the moment with the little mouse is priceless and show-stealing.
