Victor Nunez imbues this unpretentious tale of a young woman's emotional journey with a poetry rarely seen in the cinema. By poetry I mean the feeling in which the literary and the cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel has been adapted side by side to the screen. In that sense, the film achieves depths that many cannot; but it is also quite slow at other times and undermines the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui. Movie star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better movie than her debut here. She fits lead Ruby's role as a glove, almost as if she didn't have to act. She has a real movie star's presence in the movie, and has not really managed to convey the same feature in her later films, although she was impressive in Normal Life.
