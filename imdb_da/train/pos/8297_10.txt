A stylish film drawn in 2 directions. For the benefit, it is directed by Wes Craven. On the downside, the TV movie budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. It moves while Susan Lucci pulls Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and tries to persuade him to the secret of her health club. His latest invention, a room bag that can analyze people or things, is unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Her appearance and performance had unexpected consequences a few years later. Actor, researcher and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this movie and wrote a review of this film. Lucci was the subject of a portrait of him followed as a basis for the works of a sitting called Catherine. Lucci and Barbara Steele's portrait in 'Black Sunday' was used as a reference to the Catherine portraits that were immediately withdrawn by Armourae. Probably because of personal character between the artist and Catherine. So by watching both movies we can get a glimpse of another story and the look of an unknown woman who wanted to make an interesting movie.
