One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies I liked. This was the stage where Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were amazing and quite as we call it "masti" type. An evergreen entertainer with the multi-faceted Anupam Kher chipping in. The story has many exciting twists as well known to David Dhawan's potboilers. With the immediate appearance of Mrs.Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total uprising towards the end. It was great to see Amit perform with such power and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would see it some day. I give it an easy 8 out of 10 just to be pure Bollywood.
