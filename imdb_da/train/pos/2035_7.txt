Now I want to go against the grain on this movie so it works. Being a self-conscious horror fan I sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I found myself scared (quite rare). The film has, of course, a small budget and is set around charing cross station, but the film's lack of money does not distract from the story. Yes the story is a bit far-fetched and does not explain very well, but The CREEP is a classroom and continues to cut and blast everything that comes its way. Message to ladies !!! There are certain parts of the movie you should close your eyes on or at least cross your legs !! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie and it makes a change to watch a good slasher movie that actually scares
