"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And even though it's not as good as "Cop," it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a finder of lost children who have had a most unusual case. His task: to find the title character, a child with mysterious powers. This movie could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and Temple of Doom" as parts of this movie play as a Spielbergian adventure, like an Indiana Jones comedy. It has comedy with laughs and adventures with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
