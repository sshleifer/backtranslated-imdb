As others have mentioned, all the women who go naked in this movie are mostly beautiful. The reason shows much hypocrisy in the female libido. When men are around, they will be persecuted, but when no "men" are around, they become the persecutors of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be lucky at this age!). He then gets the courage to pursue his true love.
