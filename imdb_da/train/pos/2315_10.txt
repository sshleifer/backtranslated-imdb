There is so much worth in this film that it is difficult to know where to start with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect depiction of Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is actually praise. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is a sign of film making at its best.
