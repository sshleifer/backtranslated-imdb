In all the comments that praised or dusted Dalton's performance, I thought he was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled beautiful rich boy, but as a rarely strong man. I liked this version, although the video aspect shot was sometimes distracting and the scenes with Jane and St. John never really gave up. I give this a 8.
