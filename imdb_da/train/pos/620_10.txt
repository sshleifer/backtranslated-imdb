The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any maze, princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it is quite unique and stands out for itself. And I feel that the film's adaptation of this story has a far better end than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not destroy it for you. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave held by a witch in the factual field. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star, Tristan promises to pick it up for a girl he is horrified of. He does not realize that the star has shaped itself as a girl in the fairytale world, and that there are also others after her. Three older witches who will use her heart to become young again and some bickering princes. It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and pictures. It is charming and I feel it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true classic adventure that I haven't seen in the cinema since the 1980s.
