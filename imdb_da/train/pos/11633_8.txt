Red-eye is not the kind of movie to win Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, and his branding is a good indication of what a movie-goer can expect. <Br /> The fact that Red Eye is a tight little, uncomfortable 94-minute package is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's craft in producing lightweight but generally fun fare. In fact, it is the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment, attention-keeping without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on viewers. All in all, there is a cheesy sense of plot, vague terrorist subplot motivation and supporting signs, and the main section has a television movie experience. However, there are concrete elements of the Hitchcockian excitement and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth, which is ultimately a more sophisticated (and pretentious) game on the same idea that emotional crisis is being played oppressed publicly. <br /> <br /> For a movie that primarily focuses on two people sitting in airplane seats, it lives or dies on characters and script. Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdam's resourceful Lisa are the main reasons why the movie is carried off. Not only does the dialogue sing, but also gives some form of Adam's Rib-type dimension to their struggle for 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity'. <br /> <br /> In the latter part of the movie Craven gives a little bit of Scream style as a man-chases girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the "Just for Men" treatment, his ubiquitous film appearance as diverse as Super Troopers, The Ring, and this makes him the sex-genre version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short haul fun.
