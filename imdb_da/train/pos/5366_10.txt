I'm sitting here November 2006 and I still can't help raving about this movie. Arnold's best movie came in about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. The osteic a liners of Arnold in this movie make you laugh more than once. I find the play in this movie surprisingly good, as was the case in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a good job of trying to make the scenes futuristic as it should take place in 2017, but you can't help sneaking in the 80s style haircuts on men and women in the crowd and the normal TV screens in Running Man Studio, which we all know in 2006, is emerging with the advent of flat screen and HDTV. Also, computer graphics in the "The Running Man" game show intro would not look like this in 2017. Nevertheless, the story is absolutely fantastic. Not once in this movie did I want to get up and not break the end, which I often do with today's film. I really think Arnold's play is much better than he has been honored with. Now I wouldn't have chosen him governor, but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I find the producers not trying to override battle scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he is dead. It doesn't go for 20 minutes each. Stalker scenes are fast and entertaining, but they do not attempt and override it. I give this movie a 10/10 and it comes from someone who doesn't enjoy many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, then the futuristic graphic screens you want to see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
