Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom", even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "My dad was stretching to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like Airplane meetings (meat?) Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my main coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just full cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, the social comment is just too much to start commenting on. <br /> <br /> Sufice it to say, it all really works!
