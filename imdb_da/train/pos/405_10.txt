I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy film this year. I don't think "action" is the right genre, though there are lots of action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention this is an ORIENTAL fantasy moive? Please remember NOT to use Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who "poo" around, I'm not because you are still young and need to know more about "culture".
