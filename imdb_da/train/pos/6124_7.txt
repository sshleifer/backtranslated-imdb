This movie is great as hell! I think it was written as a serious movie, but when it was time for film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's throw some humor and spice it up!" In fact, the characters are also slightly developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, though, was the hair-dryer. What was it about?
