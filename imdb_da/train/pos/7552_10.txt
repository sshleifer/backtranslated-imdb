CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the "Best Short Film" award at The 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Prize" at Japan's Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the little kitten Nyaaka's soul is stolen by Death, she and her brother nyatta are on a bizarre journey to get it back. On the other side of the surrealistic dreamscape, they encounter many amazing characters and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, stunningly beautiful and has a great sense of alien and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. So it is more an anime for adults than children (they may not understand at all!). A great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. A must-see!
