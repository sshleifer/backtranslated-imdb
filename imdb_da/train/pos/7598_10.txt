"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and a bunch of other high quality exhibitions show that we are in the middle of a golden age in television history. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories emphasized by sublime filmography (incredible to use this word when describing a TV show), a killing score, amazing performances and editing. Anyone who is not hooked on this lacks one of the most important creative expressions on television ever. It may have its problems when you only see one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually a great way to look. Hope they keep it up (which I am sure they do).
