I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most other reviewers who have posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood movies and was born and raised in the United States. So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar with other Indian movies. Fortunately, no comparison needs. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands alone as nothing less than a masterpiece. In a line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important movies to get out of any studio anywhere anywhere. On a mass-appeal scale, it * could have been the Indian equivalent "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" had it been adequately promoted in the United States. This might well have been the movie that put Bollywood on the American card. The American film actor has a long-lasting love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from that plot, there are some similarities. Not least, the giant (by American standards) is 183 minutes maturity. Faced with the gruesome background of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48, a compelling human drama of a young woman is imprisoned by circumstances and pressed into trouble, she had no hand in creating. In an unsustainable position, she somehow manages not only to survive but to grow - and even to flourish. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing in any way, it is in the exhibition. The growth of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would be better illustrated - at least for Western audiences who are not known for Indian culture - if her character's "back story" was more fully developed in the early part of the film. But it would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or maybe even more. Because not one minute of the movie is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time. Better that audience should fill out some of the things that came before leaving some of the things left. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "compelling", "heartbreaking" come to mind immediately. But "uplifting" may be as good as any of them. Any story that points out the human spirit's inhumanity to the worst odds must be considered as such. And Puro's triumph - but possibly not immediately visible to those around her - is no less than inspiring. For strength alone, I am not strong enough to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Also, inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's portrayal of Puro. Too often overlooked by younger, recent actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver a completely credible character in every role she plays. She's not just Puro's role, she breathes life into the character. Manoj Bajpai's choice as Rashid was inspired. He controls too few Indian film heroes can: subtlety. His command of expression and nuance is crucial to the role. He brings more threat to the early part of the movie with his piercing staring than all the swarming riots combined. <br /> <br /> If you only see a Bollywood movie in your life, you make Pinjar.
