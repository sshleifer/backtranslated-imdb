Touch and sad movie. Portraits a writer's trials and trials that attempt to express themselves with paralysis caused by a bicycle accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his poisonous lover, whom he is often very hostile to, and his interaction with other casualties, especially a black down and out and a white supremacy biker. The film is often humorous, often sad and always credible. Get out of the box of kleenex and watch it here on a nice Sunday afternoon with your partner.
