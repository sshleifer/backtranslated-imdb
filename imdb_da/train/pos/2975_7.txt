Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the 'South Park' show, come back with something completely different. They make a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseball. It's like basketball, except that the baseball rules are involved, and there's another letter e in the title. Here's how to play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys are trying to distract you from making the shot. Sunder simple. In fact, I can try it one day. After the fight hits the streets, it quickly becomes a great success. Who would have known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very raw and stupid forest filled with lots of slapstick violence, but it actually delivers some laughs and lots of entertainment. A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor.
