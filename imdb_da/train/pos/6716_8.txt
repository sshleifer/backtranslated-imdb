A late, great Z-recording movie maker with excellent excellence Al Adamson really betrays himself with this wonderfully scary sci-fi soft-core musical comedy cruelty that plumbs deliciously gloomy and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and staggering stupidity. In the bleak totalitarian future of 2047, sex has been considered an illegal act by the big-brother-like impotent bumbling idiot controller (an entertaining goofy Erwin Fuller). However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (brilliant blonde cutie pie Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. Cinderella participates with the help of her fairy-tale Fairy Godfather (a flamboyant campy Jay B. Larson) a grand gala ball with the specific plan for seductively beautiful stud Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaches everyone that love is a positive, comfortable and complete acceptable activity. Adamson leads this ridiculous yarn with his usual all-thumb's incompetence, which performs the incredibly horrible song and dance sequences with a complete side-splitting lack of skill and flair. The incredibly strange "We need love" numbers with people in absurd animal suits who suddenly boast about the forest, is a hilarious wonder. This is the equally eerie "Mechnical Man" routine with a bunch of lumped cavorting robots. Louis Horvarth's raw static cinematography, the sticky plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's groovy throbbing disco score, the abundant free nudity (amazing brunette hottie Sherri Coyle guarantees special praise in this particular section), the brain-numbingly puerile attempt to teach lowbrow humor (Roscoe Robot law enforcement is particularly annoying), and the uniformly horrible beliefs (Renee Harmon's incredibly hammy depiction of Cinderella's wicked indulgent governor stumbling upon the great booze price here) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably terrible doozy.
