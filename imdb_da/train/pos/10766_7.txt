A thin story with many fine shots. Eyecatchers here are the three ladies from D.R.E.A.M. team. And to a lesser extent, the guy follows them. Traci Lords convincingly violates the female half of an evil business couple who intend to poison the world with anthrax. Original in this movie is the brabomben, put on a captured member of the D.R.E.A. team. Of course, she is rescued by a member, three seconds before the explosion. Although it is clearly borrowed from James Bond's 'Goldfinger' and 'You only live twice', such a climax always works well. All in all, a good watch, James Bond replaced here with three Charlie's Angels.
