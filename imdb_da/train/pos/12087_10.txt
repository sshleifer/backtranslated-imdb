I took a chance at "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the first season worth (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot and I was immediately connected to it. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon and I rate it 10 stars here. It's just as good. What I liked about it was opening and closing themes, and of course Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but most of all the relationship between judge and field as they worked together to break each case. I was so hooked that I also bought the second season as a companion and I just enjoyed it. If you do not have this excellent series on the disc, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
