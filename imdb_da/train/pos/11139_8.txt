It is hardly the things that dream about, this pursuit of the brass ring of a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame con man sidekick (DUSTIN Hoffman), soon to create a friendship based on basic survival skills. <br /> <br /> A bold movie for its time, and a prominent example of this kind of gritty landscape is explored in the more graphic films of the 60s. Symbolic of the "end of innocence" in American films, as it was the only X-rated movie to win a Best Picture Oscar. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city and expects to find women an easy way to make money when fighting over his body, but soon the city finds a cold place without welcome food to his ilk. Extended by a lame con-man (DUSTIN Hoffman) he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leaves him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the boundaries of a cold water flat to the sunshine promised in Florida, a land his friend "Ratzo "dreams of living in. <br /> <br /> But even in this last quest, they are two losers. John Schlesinger has directed the finesse of an excellent script by Waldo Salt, and John Barry's haunting "Midnight Cowboy" theme adds to the exciting moments of search and desperation. Summary: A true American classic who honestly faces a hard topic and boldly showing off the undercurrent of certain aspects of city life.
