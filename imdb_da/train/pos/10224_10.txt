... and I mean it. If not literally (after all, I haven't seen all the movies ever created!), At least obviously among them, the many I know. 5.3 ??? Rule of thumb with IMDb is this: Sometimes the movies are very popular (for example, the play Kannes-Competition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely a movie worth seeing is actually rated under 6. This movie, very worth seeing, is. A disgrace. <br /> <br /> True, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Its true rating must be an 8 or a 9. It has some malfunctions (especially Belafonte), the manuscript wanders around, sometimes. But what we have here is one of the greatest forms of government of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who leads two of the greatest actors at all times, the beloved, greater than life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a play / poetic / moral tour de force. A couple made in heaven! It is true that this movie, small bugs, does not pander to the average audience, but those interested in watching an excellent (while not out of criticism) movie by the incomparable director who gave us "The Shop on Main Street" (The best movie ever about the Holocaust) shouldn't miss this just because some stupid IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". It is not.
