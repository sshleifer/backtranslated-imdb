Okay, I'm a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says here this is the worst! But it is not !!! Haven't you seen Freddy's Revenge ??? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the Freddy story, and it's cool that he has a daughter, etc. <br /> <br /> And then I found out that it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember seeing it on the DVD box, I instantly switched to the 3-D sequences. Something was in 3-D, but like Lisa Zane's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean with a knife, Lisa Zane with a Baseball Bat, Doc's hand, exploded Freddy's head. <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I want the whole movie to be in 3-D not just the last 15 minutes. By the way, it's 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
