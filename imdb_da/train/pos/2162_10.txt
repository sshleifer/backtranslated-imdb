I was so surprised when I saw this movie so undervalued ... I understand why some of you don't like this movie. The speed is slow, a characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you will find this no problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Are we going to dance?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It's very different from Hollywood, for example. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, where a gag is guaranteed every few minutes. It is rather light heart, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "right". The reason is even satisfactory. I was so happy to see that Sugiyama (starring) has found the meaning of life in the dance. Before I saw the movie, I was a little depressed because of heavy school work. I felt lost. But this movie made me think of the bright side of life. I thought I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; If he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me to "explore my own future" and discover the happiness of my daily life. It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I like it as it makes me feel the characters are really "living" and learning to dance while the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is fun :-D
