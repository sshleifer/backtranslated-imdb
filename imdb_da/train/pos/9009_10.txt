This movie really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth .... in the most delightful, easy way. Not a serious but fun adventure. <br /> <br /> History reflects life. We don't always get what we want right away, but we find that we get what we need to understand why we didn't get what we wanted .... which results in us getting more, than we thought we would get! You get this when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing that you have found it and that it totally changed its life. It's one of my favorites all the time .... not easy to find, but worth chasing ......... I guarantee you will see it more than once!
