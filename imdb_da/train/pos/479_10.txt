Emily Watson's Natalia is definitely the most loving and romantic main character I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this movie without a doubt. Or is she sent to the king? The interncine weaving of chess games and the families' struggle for control, power and victory is fantastic. Like chess masters in the film, the director makes many simultaneous games with our minds at once, but all weigh in either large or small patterns. The period, costumes and pictures of the early 20th century Italy's lake area is captured splendidly. Not a single place is wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes abound, I can't tell them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly one week apart, because you may not be able to capture the entire poetry within a 64-inch but generally dimensional frame in one setting. <br /> <br /> I didn't read Nabakov's book, but to try my own analogy, I read what I read about another romantic triumphant poetry-as-game film, Barry Levinsons The Natural. It completely jettisoned the eerie ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director made one better by seamlessly seizing Russian and Italian morals and amusing them as a background for enlightenment. The true story here is that games are zero-sum; There is a winner and a loser unless both participants draw. But in life and especially in connection with our immortal souls, we are limited only by these limitations and the conventions of life to the extent that we let others break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as personalized by Emily Watson's Natalia, can exceed and allow us all to be enhanced by his gifts at the same time. Only the obstacles that arise from our fears can cut us off. <br /> <br /> This is a grand movie (10/10).
