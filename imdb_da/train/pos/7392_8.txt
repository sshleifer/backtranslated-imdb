I like this movie. It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect I like best, however, was that the bathhouse was more than just a background for the story. When the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual. Water was so rare that a simple bath had deep depth and meaning. <br /> Overall, the movie was very effective. However, there were moments when it threw on "for" sweet ... bordering on the cloying under the park recital scene. But overall I highly recommend this movie.
