Wow! I've seen so many bad low-cost movies lately, but this is good. The very realistic depiction of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime films or series. I loved the greatest actress and the absolute rejection of any prevailing clich√© on the police. This movie is realistic as a documentation and entertaining as a drama at the same time. A perfect departure!
