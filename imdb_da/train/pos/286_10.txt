I read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad .... I think you have to be a particular person to enjoy these movies. If you are not someone who has had Waltons or Little House ... you will not understand or enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew he was bad news from the start of the movie .... I wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think about it. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff .... it's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in Girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have enjoyed all 4 movies so far. ... Don't love the books ... Can't wait for the next movie. The way Clark talks on gets you every time. I would love to see that January Jones makes a look ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
