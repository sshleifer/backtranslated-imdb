This is a great movie for all Generation X's. What other world was America in 1972 compared to our psychotic 21st century. You can get a sense of what 1972 America passed by was like watching this movie. I found out that clothes and car styles brought back to me good memories of a much better country than we now have. Just think ... then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc. Etc. The Vietnam War was just over. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and the internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> Once this movie came out, the producers had to market the film themselves, as no other film company wanted it. Then it started to tour small Protestant churches around the country, which were shown on film projectors (it was days before VCRS of course). The priest of a church who would be interested in showing a thief in the Niches to his ward would get a copy of the movie. Then he would set up an evening to show it in the church meeting or lunch room. The congregation of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family members, and that would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you get past the movie's limited production values ​​and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then I think you'll enjoy the movie more. Of course, I speak as a gene xer. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we now have.
