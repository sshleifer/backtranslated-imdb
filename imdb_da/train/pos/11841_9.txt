This was a great movie with a good story. My kids (10, 7, 5 and 4) all loved this movie, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but instead the story is told by the Spirit. And to hear a story told by the horse's points if the view was fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit." This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie and even got it into it, they laughed so hard and they cheered for the spirit at last. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and get your spirit lifted with this heartfelt story. Your kids will love it. I think you will too.
