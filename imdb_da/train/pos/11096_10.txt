Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: A businessman is extorted by some 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does good work as the leading character and special credit come to John Glover, who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of the villains are very complex and interesting - something very rare for an action movie. also has some beautiful and sexy women - most notable is Kelly Preston as the young treasure to Schieder's character. Vanity provides a very good performance and appearance as the hooker associated with the three chanters. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret still hasn't lost it - this lady is a true treasure. Don't look at the rate for this movie. I really don't know what the public and some critics have against this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really gripping and underrated movie. You will enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
