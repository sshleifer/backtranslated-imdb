First, I just want to say what a great fan of Bette Midler is, I am. Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies all the time. It's about a mother who raises a child alone, she goes through a lot of things out of her way to bring her daughter Jenny to play wonderfully by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you download a copy to see it. Roger Ebert gave you 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!
