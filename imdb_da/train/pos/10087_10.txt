Fabulous costumes by Edith Head who painted them on Liz Taylor at her finest! The SFX is very good for a movie of its age, and the stunt doubles actually resembled the actors, even down to body type, a rarity in film in this vintage. A nice movie with fantastic panoramas - even when it's cut down for panning and scanning.
