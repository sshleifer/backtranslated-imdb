Maybe this movie is really bad, but it's very fun. The bad play and the bad direction strengthens the film's hystericalness. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go into this movie, expect the first Conan or Excalibur than you would hate it. If you see it while you are in a good mood and accept it so well, it is fun that you want to be good. Look for the scene where they are trying to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I wish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have done this !!
