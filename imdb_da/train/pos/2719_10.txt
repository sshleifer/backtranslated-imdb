I watched this movie after seeing Capote and Infamous. It's just amazing how the gay relationship between author and protagonist is sublime in the movie. The reporter is straight, the main characters are more beatniks than homosexuals. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but by reviewing it once, we get all sorts of interesting information from similar images created by the author / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> Note the incredible intersection at the start, where killers and killing are connected. Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone. Cutter washes his face matched-cut to Perry washing his face. Only Perry looks in the mirror and sees his erotic male body imagining that he is playing a guitar in Las Vegas for empty chairs. This failure / imagination is in line with the failure fantasy that Perry tells of his father who has only built a beautiful motel in Alaska to find it forever empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't I don't know they are going to die. we cut to Clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry tells his dream of a yellow bird, "Longer than Jesus," attacking the nuns who have pursued them. "The Nuns asked for mercy," he tells us, "but the bird struck them anyway." The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says he has a reluctance to nuns, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last word when he wants to apologize, but does not know who. <br /> <br /> The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep in a friend's house. She holds a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later. Nancy can't sleep over with her friends' house because her boyfriend comes over for dinner. The decision seals its fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But it's another Bogart image, "Beat the Devil," which Truman Capote wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the film's main characters ended with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $ 10,000 he believes is in Clutter's Safe (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy like Perry's Mexican Treasure.) Cut to Herb Clutter signs a $ 40,000 life insurance policy. He is thinking of mortality at the moment. Ironically, his mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wants him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours. Dick said they didn't want to be witnesses, so no one could remember them. Later it is actually because they eliminated all witnesses that they were remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was a witness," the detector continues to tell Dick later. But it was witness to the prison friend Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? Viewer witnesses after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating movies.
