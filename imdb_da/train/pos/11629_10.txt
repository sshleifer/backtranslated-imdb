Red-eye is an exciting movie by the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven portrays the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After taking part in her grandmother's funeral, she decides to take red-eye flight. During the wait, she meets this man named Jack Rippner (how is fffrreeaakkyy it?) And they become friends. Ironically, both are sitting right next to each other on this plane. Then it is like that when the horror starts. This movie is exciting, and to the weak hearted people who do not like exciting / horror movies, we can say that it is possible that they might pee in their pants. This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production. Wes Craven did well with this movie. He chose the real actors like Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is careful about everything when she's acting in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the scary and frightening actor who can relax your bones by his amazing plays is the bad character in this movie and his face can really broaden your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope he does more movies like this.
