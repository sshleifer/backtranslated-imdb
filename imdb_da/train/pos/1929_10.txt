I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say it's the best movie I've seen all year round and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to write a comment / review on. This movie was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogues, excellent plays and an inspirational message. Ordinary life comes together in an adult swimming class and becomes extraordinary in celebrating the diversity of life. This is clearly illustrated by the picture in the first minute of this captivating film, where we only see the legs and torso of individuals of different shapes and sizes into a pool of water. This movie is brilliantly controlled as the actors are placed and placed in captivating scenes that hold your attention and imagination.
