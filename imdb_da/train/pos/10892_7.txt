What doesn't you like about this movie? Every year you know that you will get one or two yule tidal movies during Christmas time, and most of them will be horrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was drawn quite well. A very fun, take a rich young guy who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What's good about having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. An ordinary family gets six numbers and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to handle and it was just a rebellion to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and fun movie.
