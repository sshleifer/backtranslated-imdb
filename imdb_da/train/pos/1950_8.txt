Diane Keaton has played a few "heavy" parts in her many years on the big screen, but she is best known for the "light and fluffy" stuff with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it is not really what the competition was the year it was first shown. Try and find a scene where she does not appear. And it was all heavy drama, exhausting in its pace and resumption, action, all at full speed. The make-up made her as young as possible, and she suited the 30-year-old even in close-ups, but she played half of her age and at a very fast pace. The movie, overall, was pretty well finished, staged and shot well with a strong support, but Keaton carried the load.
