A favorite of mine, this movie tells of two sweeping New York characters, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), both of whom strive to be "Main Guy" in Bowery at the end of the nineteenth century . <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a highly fictitious account of their antics (based on a game). Brodie's legendary (did he? - It is still an argument!), Leaping from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), which he became famous for, appears here as of the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). Director Walsh clearly had a great love for the period, so beautifully restored here, and it contains a wildly rumbustic ragtime number from salon singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is at his most beautiful as Brodie, and Beery again shows what a smart actor he was, so hard, big-hearted and sometimes touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest, both boys pursue. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early "talkies"). It's not an easy movie to find, but it's worth watching.
