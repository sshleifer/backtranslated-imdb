`Bruce Almighty 'will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass 'Titanic' as the highest grossing movie of all time! Jim Carrey's fame will be at such a high level that he will announce his presidential candidate to the end of the White House in 2004. Almighty then! These great fantasies would only appear if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would have God's powers. The same premise is the most important ingredient in Carrey's new grin series "Bruce Almighty". Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the chief anchor that he holds God to the total duty of his own contretemps. God, heavenly play by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce God's gift (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Bruce obviously gets away with his newly found happy abilities and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his ordinary omnipotent comic form in 'Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not "misleading" as Bruce's girlfriend. But my premier kudos goes to director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog get out of the house for No. 2 and show us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene all the time! "Bruce Almighty" is not the most in-depth Carrey movie, but it is still an all-powerful chuckling show of 'Carreyism'! **** Well
