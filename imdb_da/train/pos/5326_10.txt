"The Beatles' birth, to be an American television film released in the fall of 1979, has actually been the best movie that so far tells the story of the four lads from Liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world. As can be seen from the previous Beatle Pete Best's point of view. The performance from the whole role is excellent, but especially the performance of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The movie was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr Dick Clark. Who a year earlier in 1978 had produced another television movie that has been the time trial with "Kurt Rusell" starring another musical legend; "ELVIS". That film was directed by an unknown instructor named "John Carpenter" who continued to lead other successful films like; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said for the director of "Beatles birth", Richard Marquand. He continued to lead other theatrical blockbusters such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other movie that tells the story of Fab Four that I know of is Back Beat, which had a theater release in 1994. But the critics did not care about it, nor the public, for it did not have a long life in the theater . The Beatles birth is a very charming and simplified movie that gives you the essence of the legend's beginnings and the battles and hardships that they went through and end with account for success as they arrive in NYC and appear in the 1964 Ed Sullivan show Highly recommend this movie.
