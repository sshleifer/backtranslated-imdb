"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham" thought the average fan expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; maybe expect a few temporal shifts, but not too hard for "me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. Ah, be aware you need to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no extra coke from the counter, no "keep it running" shouts as you sip the fridge - watch the movie! No one laughs other than those you can make yourself of the significant violence (and if it floats your boat then it is) but sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue and good performances. My favorite - Big Pussy from the Soprano, always a reliable hood.
