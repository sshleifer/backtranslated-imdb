This is a fantasy movie for children based on Boggy Creek Legend, although I don't know why they called it. Go back to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare. Dawn Wells stars as the mother of 3 children who go off in the swamp around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid. Yes it is very silly and the plot is grainy, but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y / o group it targeted. It is harmless G-rated stroller and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they see it. Strictly for 8-12 years / year set, older children will be bored and think it's boring.
