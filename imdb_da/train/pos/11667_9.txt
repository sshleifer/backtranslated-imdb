Kells Secret is a movie I've been waiting for for years after seeing some early screenings at Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you now, it's been worth the wait. The drawings are highly stylized but not annoying as I would fear. The whole movie is a beauty and great imagination, I especially love the animated illuminated book where the little characters come to life on the page. The characterization is amazing, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as the backbone of Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the spirited Aisling. The forest is a triumph, a beautiful place. The story is well realized, a mixture of facts and imagination. and really attracts the viewer to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book. Still, I am lovers of calligraphy and lighting, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and are not fans of the craft, agree that it is a nice little movie. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. :) Coming back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the best in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.
