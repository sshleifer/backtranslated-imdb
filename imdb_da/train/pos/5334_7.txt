See, though we cannot admit it, we must all suppress our fear of the great probability of experiencing the events taking place in this movie. You know: You enter your car and you start thinking immediately: "Gosh, I hope today is not the day my accelerator sticks to a comfortable speed of 55 mph, all four door locks break in locked position, both my main and emergency brake fault, my ignition key cannot be switched off and i have a full tank of gas at the same time. "Luckily for most of us, our Thorazine kicks in before we actually decide it is a bad idea to drive a car . Not so for the decision makers in the scary, white knuckle, the edge of your seat (if only in preparation for leaving the room) action juggernaut, "Runaway Car" But they go ahead and drive anyway! <br /> <I'm infinitely happy to have found (thanks to imdb) that this movie is genuine and that I didn't just dream it. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least a movie of the amazing sights you want to see on your journey to find El Dorado of Very Bad Cinema. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
