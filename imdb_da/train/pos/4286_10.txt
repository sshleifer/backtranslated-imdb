I watched this movie (the English title is "Who's Singing Over There?") At the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. It won raves so ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It is brilliant. Sublim, ridiculous, sad and very funny. Scripture is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a handful of comedies (or any other genre for that matter) that can match its originality.
