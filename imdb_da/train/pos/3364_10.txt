I was also amazed to see how few people voted for this movie and just HAD to write something about it, even though my comments are very similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like many things about movies. The amazing play between Mastroianni & Loren. The film is told: Humanity and love are slowly evolving between these two outsiders and, contrary to the fascist radio announcer's contemporary and continually ongoing inhuman march pace (which happens to be a colleague of Mastroianni's part) and the followers "go to the show". For me, this is a very nice movie about what it is to be human. Perhaps some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clearly delivered, but for me it did not destroy the film in any way. My vote is 10/10.
