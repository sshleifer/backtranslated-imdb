A heart-warming film. The usual amazing play by John Thaw who passed by recently. A man who was always so modest. He was one of England's top 10 actors determined by my time. He can be remembered for his famous role as Morse Inspector. When Jack Regan hit television series' Sweeney in the 1970s and as barrister in Kavanah QC. One should look for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. The movie will bring back a few memories to people who remember wartime Britain and determined those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William were really well acted and faithful to the book by Michelle Magorian.
