I had the TV for a white noise companion and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment" So I ran into the television room, expecting a 70-inch flick and got much more. Fortunately, I could rewind to the start (DVR buffer) and press the record button to see it completely. (Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) Apart from some gaps in history and intermittent improbable dialogue / events, this is an effective thriller worth your time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played agility by Cristina Raines, Parker staff, in a very gory way, her father, an explicit menage of a threesome scene. (Don't let the kids see) The movie is TOTAL 70 full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascots) and decor, bad hair, overflowing music score and well-known cigmatography. Cast is excellent, take a second on this movie's website to check it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully scary! ENJOY!
