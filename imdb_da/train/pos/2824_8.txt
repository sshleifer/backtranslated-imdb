Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept of course by fate and our actions, as in a stream, which causes us to lose some of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but is too easily influenced by her dominant mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops reputation for being a loose woman. In fact, part of her attitude is bitterness over Raphael's surrender. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is the famous La Brunna, and Garbo behaves as a diva she really was and was valued with such cold glory in her later depictions. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez is reminiscent of Valentino's looks in this part, and he was decorated to be a Valentino clone by the MGM, although he never thought he could be in reality and he had right. He is trustworthy in an unsympathetic part as a weak wild mom's boy and allows himself to live realistically but comically at the end of the film. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home, and later, as he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets showing Spain at that time are authentic leaders. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I do not think that Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together when he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and I do not think that It would have been happy in a small village. The end is true to life and draws no blows. <br /> <br /> See this as Garbo's American film debut and a precursor to the things to come
