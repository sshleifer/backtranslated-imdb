I think this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows the different communities that leave each other in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various societies are led by the king. The sites around the court are, as usual, a struggle for power with a lot of treason. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also produced locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephant as executors is very interesting. It's fun, and I think it can also be used in schools for its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europeans in Asia were issues of local kings in a completely different way to the traditional Hollywood perspective.
