Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of images in this early silent movie. The movie's plot, involving two boxers fighting over a girl, is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it. However, Hitchcock's talent has been found in his amazing use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Particularly memorable are the jewelry that a boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He slides it on his arm in a clear sexual way, and with a single movement, Hitch has shown us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting views, which again show how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was. The film also provides insight into his later treatment of women. The object of the boxers' wishes is driven by money and desire, not reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones that help destroy happy relationships. All in all, Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller.
