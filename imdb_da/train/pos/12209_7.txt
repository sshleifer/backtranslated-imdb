I was very impressed with this small, self-made image. The story of a couple of social broadcasts that meet, make friends and provide each other with a support system that both seemed to be lacking as children, are sometimes fun, sometimes sad but always provocative. Music, mainly of underground bands, was used for great effect, like the experiment with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the leaders played by the authors and film directors) are some of the best I've seen in the last few years. If you've ever felt that a square stick is being forced into a round slot, I really think you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
