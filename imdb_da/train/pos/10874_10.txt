<br /> <br /> I must admit I was expecting something quite different from my first view of 'Cut' last night, but was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I am a true horror fan just as true as they come and found 'Cut' not only to be the best of the genre ever produced by Australia but one of the great parody / comedy films at the end. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the general public can't pick up many of the comic items - the movie wasn't too clever in its application, but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit into any possible clich√© of the horror genre they could. I am sure this was the meaning of humor .... hope this was intended as a humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there were things going. <br /> <br /> The use of 'custom' garden shears was brilliance - beyond the expected staff and slashes. In short, there was a great deal of variation and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptical films of this movie. <br /> <br /> The look of both Kylie Minogue (short of her appearance) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the movie - both performances were amazing as well as Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as a jokey technician. All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> Loved it. Go see it!
