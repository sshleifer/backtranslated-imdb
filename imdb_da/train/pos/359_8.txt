I can't believe I'm watching this movie right now - I might think it was another movie about slaves being abused, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - just as I haven't seen Schindler's list - Don't be "entertained" by other people's pain no matter how authentic or informative it should be. So I guess the most important thing I noticed about The Purple was that black people were not mistreated by whites. The black people were quite capable of raping their own daughters - or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to see, but everyone eventually redeemed, and the play was phenomenal! I couldn't believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to begin with - she was great. I'm so happy I felt miserable yesterday afternoon and Showtime drove The Color Purple.
