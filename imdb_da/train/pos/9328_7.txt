The perfect son is a story of two 30-something brothers, one who is apparently "perfect" and the other, who is basically a screw top, often lands in drug rehab centers. After their father's death, the two are gathered after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resumes. It is only until the "perfect" brother makes the outrageous revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother finally takes a step to get his life in order and take some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie does a good job chronishing the younger brother's "comeback", although it may seem a little television at times (beating drug abuse is never so easy). What makes the film more widespread is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has suffered from cinema over the past 5-10 years. And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly celebrating brothers is very credible and well done. The two main players were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid first effort by director and author Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is also well done. <br /> <br />
