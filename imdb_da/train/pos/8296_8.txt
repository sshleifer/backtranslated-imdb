Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in as the father has got a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without the man, as it certainly contains secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but it is the pressure for him to attend, as everyone in the neighborhood and at work is members. Robert Urich's good lighthouse is a little lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy is a good natured housewife who changes unpleasant sizzles. Suspenseful and well-prepared chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chair. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a part as a cop. The film captures the feeling of paranoia and the special effects are finally worth waiting for. I've seen this movie a few times.
