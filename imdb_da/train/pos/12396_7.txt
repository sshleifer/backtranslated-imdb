This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about 'The Matrix' world. In this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together It is a small story lesson in 'The Matrix' world. Not as good as the first part ("The Final Flight of the Osiris"), but still pretty entertaining.
