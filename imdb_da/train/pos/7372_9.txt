"This is not a love song" is an excellent example of the chase genre that many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see this. <br /> <br /> I really feel this is portrayed with such scenes that blow back and letterwriting. Heaton shows great intimacy to Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spike's name on top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the movie has been slated, the critic does not seem to have fully understood the movie as they have not even mentioned the possibility that Heaton have sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers have not recognized it when they use phrases like: "Who is Heaton? What is he doing with a retard like Spike?" However, this person may have hit the nail upside down with their comment. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I do not think this person has realized this when he seems to use the word "retard" as a derogatory term. I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not too weak heart. The film is extremely character-based, after the recording to the end there is not much, but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you are used to watching such deep, grinning movies, stay away.
