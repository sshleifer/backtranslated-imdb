I can't remember this movie getting a cinema release here. I saw it only when it came on cable. The film deals with the dehumanization of children in killers. Especially a person, the way he is replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world society where he finds himself unable to cope with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected to be Rambo in space and would have been happy if it was. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad it wasn't - Kurt does a good job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene where he sits outside the connection shows this, though the decision on two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, but unfortunately, it's the closest thing I've seen in it for a long time. <br /> <br /> He changes into the film to a credible degree, he does not crack Arnie one liners, he does not become Snake Plissken, and there is no definite happy ending. That's why this movie didn't do it well. It did not follow formula, and among an 18-25-year-old American-targeted audience, it is unforgivable, as it was not what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
