Not a movie to be taken seriously, but a great little movie anyway. It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. The actor, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies would not go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes around the cable. Like an old friend. Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
