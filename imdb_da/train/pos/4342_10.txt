This movie didn't really surprise me, as such it just got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well ... we'll see how he does ..." Then I saw Peter Falk in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I was never a big fan of the show, I always wanted to see Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played each other so well that I almost felt dizzy with joy! ... And I hadn't even drunk! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to go directly to the phone to Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was about or who was in it or something. It just came and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to see it ..." ... and I just ended up loving it!
