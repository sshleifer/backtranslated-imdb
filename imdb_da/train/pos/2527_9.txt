This is what I call a "pre sci fi; sci fi" movie. It does not get any better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type movie image. These two true artists are the best, just like the story. Karloff does a fantastic job as a scientist who sees himself trapped in a shadow of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was trapped in the idea of ​​seeing a man as he drowned in the three previously mentioned concepts. I was saddened and fascinated at the same time with the two stars that they do themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that asks for a remake. This time, Harrison Ford put in the Karloff section and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as the Bela Lagosi role. It may be possible to do it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the very best Hollywood ever produced. As I said .. it doesn't get any better. No way.
