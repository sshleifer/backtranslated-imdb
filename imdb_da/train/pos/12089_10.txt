<br /> <br /> Films dominated by ravenous Barbara Steele were seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallidic vampire men and women stalking a castle that sought blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and another world beauty, and the dead-day views predict Romero's NIGHT for the Vibrant Dead Shamblers who unite them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I can't see the connection between this movie and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about the current forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretention that wakes you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such drawing for HAUNTING's overwhelmed Claire Bloom. The comparisons to HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> No, this movie does NOT need to be restored. Not only is it a product from the 60s, but the vast percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot understand MACABRE's formula for terror. This formula is based on an overall factor: GOOD WRITING. Classes in low class such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe movie with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a common strong writing. It is simple. Get a real author like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess. Besides that, let Hollywood try some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the apparently superior product of the past.
