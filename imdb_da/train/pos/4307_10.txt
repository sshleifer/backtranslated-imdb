Well, maybe not just before the Rodney King runners, but even a few months before was timely enough. My parents said they saw it, and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted and LA was burned to the ground. It just goes to show the state of race in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African American Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon saves Mack's life in the black ghetto. However, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) believes that free violence is really cool ... until he gets shot. There is also some existentialism in the movie: Mack and his family come to realize that they are not living as they really want. It seems that "Crash" has some renewed people's interest in race relations, but this one came out much earlier. Perhaps we will never have stable race conditions in this country. But somehow the "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. It confirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
