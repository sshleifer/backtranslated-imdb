In the beginning you think of another Disney movie, it may be good, but it's a kids movie. But when you see it, you can't help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I first saw this movie when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is amazing and couldn't play it better. Christopher Lloyd is fun and perfect for that. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can't help but to enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
