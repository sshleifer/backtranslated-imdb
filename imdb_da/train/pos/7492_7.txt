Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the goods. It looks like a vampire is loose in a small German town that drains its victims for their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical of believing in a gallic killer, not a vampire running amok. The only one who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray) inspector's boyfriend and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who apparently joins the vampire theory with a prominent scientist. The cities suspect the innocent Herman Gleib, played with his usual madness by Dwight Frye, who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The movie contains a bit of humor that helps relieve some of the intensity involved in all the murders that have been committed. A fun part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, and thinking strange Herman has not turned into a bat, but to a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. This budget film brings elements from "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with Dr. Niemann using the proposal to get a somnambulist to execute his orders, from "Frankenstein" using the human blood to help create life in the lab and "Dracula", since the murders are believed by all but the inspector and his girl to be blood sugar. Thses elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer with a small comedy thrown in for good. The composition works. The restored version I considered used staining to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
