This Night Listener is better than people generally say. It has weak sides, and it seems to be a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its scary atmosphere and exciting performances make up this. It all feels like one of the four places "this happened to a friend of my friend" ghost stories. A big complaint about the movie is pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is conscious. Everything that unfolds in this movie is well kept within the possibilities and the real life just kind of plods along? No? So there are no flashy endings or earthquake revelations, no "showdown" scenes. Thank you sky You must enter the zone when you see this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventional) good movie. Williams is not amazing, but he easily meets the needs of history, plus his character must be somewhat generic ("No One"), as he is Everyman, the avatar that we ourselves enter the story with. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (though she may not win it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is probably in the top 20 percent of movies coming out these days.
