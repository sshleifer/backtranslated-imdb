In this "acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a famous writer and evening for night talk show, is fascinated by the hanging story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). Questions arise about this boy's story but Gabriel finds himself attracted to an expanding mystery that conceals a deadly secret? "according to the film's official synopsis. You really should stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> "How did he lose his leg?" ending, with Mrs Collette planning her new life, should be chopped out and sent to "deleted scenes" country. It's overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental disorders should be obvious as Mr. Williams returns to New York. Perhaps her blindness could be in the question - but a revelation could have been determined in either "highway" or "video tape" scenes. The movie would benefit from a re-editing - what about a "director's cut"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) don't seem to be initially credible as a couple. A scene or two that establishes their relationship could have helped set the scene. Otherwise, the casting is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a "homosexual appearance". Sandra Oh (like Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collettes "Donna" belongs to the creepy hall of fame. Mrs. Oh, it is true that Collette might be, "you know like the guy from 'Psycho'." There have been several years when organizations that made trades seemed to reach out to women because of a slimmer role allocation. They could certainly have noticed Collette with a price utilization. She's so good. And director Patrick Stettner certainly evokes Hitchcock - he even makes a sandwich from a vending machine suspensive. Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from the pilots everywhere. <Br /> <br /> ******* Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
