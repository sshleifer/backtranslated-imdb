This is a beautiful, rich and very well done movie with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it tells how an old master historian must find a (man) heir to carry his craft, but does not end up getting what he expected in his very male dominated world. The characters then have to deal with their situation, and the old master must fight with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions. The story is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and feelings is rich and convincing that character development is strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional at all. The film expertly transmits the old man's feelings and his desire to find an heir, and shows convincingly how he and the child handle the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. The film also explores the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating additional interest and depth in the film. <br /> <br /> The management, play and scenario are all unique. Added to the other forces, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, genuine characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy and feelings about the characters. <br /> <br /> Some have argued that the end is weakening the movie, but I don't necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with another ending, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been rather small.
