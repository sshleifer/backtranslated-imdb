This short is a confusion. Words fail me here, as it is almost indescribable, technically exceptional after more than 90 years (art is remarkable and even occasionally fantastic), it is not something you see if you like things that are secular or "normal" - Because it is most It is certainly not either. This is a strange one gang. It is worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy hurt your head, you can skip this. Recommended.
