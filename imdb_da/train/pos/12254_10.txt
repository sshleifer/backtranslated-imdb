I've watched this movie after watching Paltrow's version. I found one very good and I thought it wouldn't be so good ... but I was wrong: The British version was much better and comfortable! I found Jeremy Northam more "comfortable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better Austen's Knightley. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed a few things, but remains faithful to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 Min 2 cents!
