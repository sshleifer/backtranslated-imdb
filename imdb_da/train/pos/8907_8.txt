I watched this movie at midnight on On Demand the second night, without knowing what to expect. I had heard about this movie, but never really any opinions about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say I was impressed by what I saw. I was really freaked out in some parts and I certainly remember jumping up in my seat a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The Blob was scary looking. Now I look in a jug of jelly and wonder if it will lock itself on my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was great as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the movie. I also liked the old man in the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a 50's horror movie, it was very well done even in today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
