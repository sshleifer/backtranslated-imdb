For the first time I watched this movie 3 years ago and it was introduced when Disney boss Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago it came back on TV and this time I lost it. Since then I must have seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring, good movie that is intelligently written and credible by all concerned. It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all the other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie where kids aren't jerks and having a lot of behavioral problems is refreshing, and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone-driven muscleheads. <br /> <br /> It's just normal people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood, as gone, is another extreme to what they term "gritty realism," making movies where everyone is cursing, and having trouble with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. People in Big Lake TX seem so kind that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the movie doesn't try to overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I've seen him from the late 70's and he's so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent performances from ALL involved and kudos to the authors. <br /> <br /> A gem in the movie is near the end when jim practices in dugout before the big game and his wife calls him from the stands. He hurries over and reaches out to his family. The appearance of the three other jars that sit on the bench in the dugout is invaluable. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change in pace, select this movie.
