This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever - a British, better this is spinal loss. The characters are trustworthy, the plot is great, and you can really empathize with some of the events - like Ray's band mounting problem. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Real period stuff, even if it is in the same key, you will humming some of the songs for days. What I liked was the almost British cast, with some of the preferred household names. Ray's wife is invaluable ... <br /> <br /> The movie never draws, it just goes at the right pace and has some really fun sections in it. A generator of some really good catchphrases! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
