<br /> <br /> Arriving at boxcar in New York, the clever young woman with BABY FACE begins the cannula approach to the upper floors of a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-code drama. Without a bunch of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unfortunate enough to get in the way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has full opportunity here to show off his many talents. <br /> <br /> Looks pretty late in history, George Brent is a welcome addition that one guy might be able to handle Stanwyck; His sophisticated style of acting makes a good point of departure for her icy progress. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a number of her unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears just a few seconds as a failed suitor for Stanwyck's feelings. This would be the only time these two performing artists appeared on the screen. Movie Mavens would recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank managers - all unbilled. <Br /> <br /> The music that was heard on the soundtrack throughout the film is perfectly drawn in the plot, the Baby Face (1926) by Benny Davis and Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of the accuracy of pre-code. In his frank & unapologetic dealing with sex, it is precisely this kind of film that the implementation of the production code in 1934 was supposed to eliminate.
