I watched this movie on Thursday night after having a really boring day. I had no expectations they were a little negative. Being the only movie I've ever seen Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... don't ask why! But seriously .. This movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can't I meet a sweet geek like that. :) Movies like that are great. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we do not have the sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
