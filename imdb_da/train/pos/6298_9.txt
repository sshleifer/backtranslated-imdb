Fun. I went with 8 friends for a sneak preview of this movie. We came to look differently, but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got into this time, the joke was fun, and they became fun throughout the movie. In the first part, you just keep asking yourself about these "malinski" and "bellini" things (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they continue to repeat the same jokes (in different terms) they will be more fun and more fun. In search of this malinski, all the main characters are introduced the first one more than the next. Until half of the film was over, we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this snail show but we probably had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comic movies with great dialogue, you will love it. Except Clooney This movie deserves much better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when several ppl have seen it, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I think I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
