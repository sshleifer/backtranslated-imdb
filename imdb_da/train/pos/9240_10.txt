Found this flick in a videostore, it cost $ 2 to buy. The whole movie really stinks badly! The so-called Colonel, who would the hero here if the cover could have been entrusted, must be in the eighties and is hardly able to walk. He still manages to shoot some of the stupid ninjas in the world. Then the story tells the colonel, meaning the old man's inability to make something worth mentioning, a now scary eighties look at what must have been a kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but didn't mind because the movie is so bad it's really fun to watch. Zero Budget Rubbish bin with actors who do not deserve that name. Go check it out!
