As in Amelie, recent French films seem to take a stereotypical male relationship centered on a woman who finds her only true love. In this case, desperation leads to a convicted person, leading to her development in a mob prototype. Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the woman is there to support the cock. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which seems to be increasingly the case with European films, is amazing and in perfect synchronization with the film's variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of different urban horror films. There's a Wes Craven in Chicago feel it.
