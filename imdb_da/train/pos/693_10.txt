This is an almost action movie that follows Jack, a weakness as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself away from a building and for much of the time he cannot see the reality from hallucination. Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really trustworthy. Confused and frightened, but lethargic and sometimes accepting what he sees, we follow him to try to figure out what he sees and find a way to sleep. Introduce a spoken dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they came there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, fun boggling, 43 minutes And the shower is enough to get any dom fan back for more.
