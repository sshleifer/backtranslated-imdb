In my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it was short 10 years earlier. I doubt it would benefit modern technology, but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animated did a good job. In my opinion, this movie boasts the best background art and one of the best character designs. Animation is extremely smooth and realistic. Throughout the film, you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a good job. It can also boast of one of the most feminine female animated characters, if not the sexiest, that tastes typical anime girls with ease. Unfortunately, there are a few bad thorns about this movie that do not make it so appealing at the moment. First, the drawing and performance are comparable to contemporary fairy-tale films, and are truly old-fashioned by modern standards. Secondly, because of the duration, it will benefit extra 20 minute dialogues. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment. Conclusion: A good alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not a novel.
