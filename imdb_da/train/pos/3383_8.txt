Especially for a time when not much science fiction was filmed (1973), this is a fantastic view of a future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only ones who can live in comfort are the rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think) and it reminds you of your worst view of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps) able to portray a number of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here he is torn between being a policeman who is just a bit corrupt (taking rare food contributions from the rich) and is completely corrupt (actively condemning evil). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be going on at night, and sweat dripping from everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I hadn't seen it before, I knew the famous end (which won't be revealed), but the end is certainly foreshadowed. Big Scenes with Edward G. Robinson: Go for advice (consisting of older Jews with heavy accents so it appears) where truth is revealed. And then go out to Thanatopsis to check out. <br /> <br /> Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction.
