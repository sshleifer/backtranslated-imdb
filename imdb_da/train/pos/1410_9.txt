EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 Big Screen customization of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some really staggering moments of "how the hell did they get this recording?! "while welcoming the stunning scenery of animals into their natural habitats and environmental awareness in the circle of life, can be cruel (witness a great white shark that strikes down a whale watching as a quick meal!) and sweet (the various babies and their 'renter). The basso profundo tones of the narrator James Earl Jones solidify his 'eye of sight' and depth. Culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only gripe comes from the fact that this should have been in IMAX format and could even go further! Oh, yes, there is always the next time (since Disney Studios has produced this number on a number of more to come). Dirs: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
