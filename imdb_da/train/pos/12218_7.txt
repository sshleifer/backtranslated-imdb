Japan is in serious trouble. Demons have attacked Edo, possessing earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. In addition, the rebirth of Askur, the queen of the demon, is near. The only thing that stands against this serious threat is the Demon Wardens, a horrible group of warriors who may just as badly as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Five years ago, Izumo is a retired Demon Warden who took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after an unfortunate killing of an innocent child (in a fight that strangely reminiscent of bar scene from Foam for Dawn). One night at a chance he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes coincide (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / swordplay epic, you would have been wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. It's a hodge-podge of many different genres of movies. They just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre fairly respectfully (though the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> For sure there are errors in the movie. Some of the humor seems constructed and out of place. And the play is not the greatest. But do you seriously see Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for the big actors? No, we see them for the action and the crazy CG images Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all actions, but it is spread out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> The bottom line; The movies have their faults and are not a martial art epic, but it doesn't try to be, and it has interesting visuals and good sword action. The reason why the movie worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously, and if the viewer does the same, they are sure to be happy for this fun and stupid swimming fantasy fantasy action flick. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
