Poorly cast, horrible script full of holes, hot blonde being eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously unpleasant mustache, a man takes on a peloton of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they solve the problem by blowing his head off the monster ... Awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Haha. Good gored up fun filled with predictable phrases and ridiculous a liners. I really enjoyed this movie, but before you see it, make sure you have a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I can't think in my right mind that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. But if you can see it and sit back and just enjoy, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way it was supposed to be enjoyed. Very simple. So get some popcorn and a few beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. It brought some joy to my life.
