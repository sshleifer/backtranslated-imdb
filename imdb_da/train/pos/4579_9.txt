I think this movie was reasonbaly good. It is a little strange that the Olsen twins are now 13 and have lovers and everyone. I enjoyed them a lot as they were young children all over the house. Nevertheless, the casting was good and the film was a little fun. I have a little mixed up between all the switch points and their names. It's just a kind of older version of it takes two.
