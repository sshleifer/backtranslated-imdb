This is the movie I've seen more than anyone else (I think I saw it on average once a year since it was released). And every time I see it, it's just as amazing and always reveals something new to me. Casting was probably a combination of the very best ever in ex Yu film. This movie is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker movie that everyone should have in their private video collection.
