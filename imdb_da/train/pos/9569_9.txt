As I understand it, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 Hong Kong movies kind of gone. At least until now, and what a fantastic movie this is. I knew it was a serious crime drama that went in, but being the first cat. 3 I bought what was made recently, I wasn't sure what to expect. A Cambodian hitman goes to Hong Kong to knock the wife's wife, who is also a lawyer. It turns out that the referee made the event for the hit man because she divorced the judge and threatened to take all her money. This is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is given away. After the battle, the police find the quick man, but try to arrest him, several police and civilians are killed. He removes the police and now the race is catching the guy before he returns to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to breathe. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the hit man turns out to be very difficult to track and pull down when they find him. Along the way, the battle finds trying to hide in a dump that a woman is raped and mistreated by a man. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the hit man to take her with him in his escape. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster that just moves and moves at high speed, as an incident leads to another, and the police sometimes are as bad or worse as the hit man. The action is exceptionally good, and the location of movies and photography is sometimes breathtaking. There is no charge in this movie, not even with the very incredible end. The end is largely unbelievable, and also an appropriate end to all actions and violence. Yes, the violence is sometimes brutal, but it is a very no nonsense crime that will knock off your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a more widespread release, including a R1 release for sure. Great movie, highly recommended.
