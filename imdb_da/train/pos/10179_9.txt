The Cave is a very good movie. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, which also adapted this story to the screen. Some really first-class plays, not just by Van Huêt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly had TV work before Axel van de Graf's performance. The movie seems to kick like a thriller and puts an excellent mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed little by little in a very convincing flash-back structure, which increases the film's more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama. Ultimately, everything culminates in an emotional ending that will seize the audience at their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you see this movie. A must-see, especially if you liked the "Spoorloos" (The Vanishing's original screen customization).
