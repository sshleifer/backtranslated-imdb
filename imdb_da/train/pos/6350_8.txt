I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over, but I can't wait for this to come out for everyone to buy! Not a big fan of Jim, but it suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and "feel good factor" is out of the scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fab job that made it a movie. If you haven't seen it then you do it if you have it, then look again, I know you want to!
