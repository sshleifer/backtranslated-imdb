This is one of my favorite martial arts films from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts films he directed. You can see his influences from working under Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, match choreography is performed by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the evil in the film. It stars Wei Pei of "Five Venom's" fame and a variety of faces known to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The story is interesting, there are a few decent plot twists, and the construction of the characters and their relationship to each other is wisely done. This movie has only had a VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a region 3 DVD, and there are versions of it DVD available from the United States. The film is nice to look at whether it is original language or in the English dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
