2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles that are frightening at several levels in an obvious tribute to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is both ultra-modern and crumbling in decay. And in the blink of an eye, surveillance is being swept away, a beautiful young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving his sister in a seedy nightclub. A hard police officer examines. Shown in strong black and white, with the gloomy corridors, shady alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most cooked by film noir, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story is due more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller. As high-tech surveillance, almost invisible stealth suits and ruthless super corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars. The film never creates the stupid atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its technologically heavy marginal characters associated with industrial types from companies, all of whom seem to have their own ministry for fear, but the viewer certainly gets the feeling that future Paris is none utopia and science of the future are less than benevolent. And as the police's procedural plot line unfolds, we are taken into the darker recessions of individual ambition under the shining veneer of the Avalon Corporation's cultivated PR image. The movie recording process used here gives a peek between B & W comics and next generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your taste. Nevertheless, there is a great visual sense on the display here, and the future Paris is filled to the small details that give the picture a unique look, which in turn is both spartan and baroque. Worth a visit.
