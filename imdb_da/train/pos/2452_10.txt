It's a good show and I find it fun. Finally, the bad Latin stereotypes are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and I just started to see it in three months. The whole concept of a Latin family television show really amazed me. I'm surprised that Latinos finally has a good shot to be on TV. This show is probably the best I've seen, it's fun, cordial, drunk and nice.
