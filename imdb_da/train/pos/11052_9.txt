When I was six, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones", and even though I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me see "The Champions" and "The Avengers "once a week. I think it was the English series in the Golden Age ... (I already own the full cycle of "The Fanger"!) But also lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" ( I'm just me, or this is "Harry Potter" in girl, of course, until as much as I want "The Campions" to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (pack the entire series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 dvds, thanks, i couldn't spend more for it, 8), "people of tomorrow" and several other "low budget" but good stories to be available within my reached zones Talk and understand English, but not all my family members, including my parents, introduced me to these great stories ... One day someone hopes someone could feel the attraction of those series and then sell them when I originally saw them .. Double or subtitle, but in the same format I saw them, remember that Zone 1 or 4 is OK with my TV!
