The prominent lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins a acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but also part of a blackmail that reached the city's highest fate. Because of his own involvement, he undertakes to investigate the identity of the "unknown man" who directs the syndicate and kills him. The irony engages when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Although it is a bit of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the unknown man for the noir cycle belongs less to style or structure than to his acknowledgment of the profound corruption in the US municipal policy discovered in the post-war years.
