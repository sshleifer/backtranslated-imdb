Yes, I call this a perfect movie. Not a boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little-known actresses and actors, a large selection of characters, all of whom are well-defined and who all have understandable motives, I could sympathize with perfect lighting, sharp black and white photography, an appropriate soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set of designs and a story that is engaging and working. It is one of the premier images that all of Hollywood's pride should rest on, the field that everyone should try to achieve. Barbara Stanwyck is simply amazing. There was nothing that this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time convey true feelings. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts in her long career, and this is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits well with this movie. It's all about wishes, human desires, I believe everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to be damaging in this movie, every character seems to be impulse, everyone wants to be happy without harming anyone else. The sad fact that this often leads to complications makes it dramatic content that I do not want to go here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this movie has to say about youth, maturity, and the need to compromise. The movie that I mostly relate to is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt, creating a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America. The story has some resemblance to Fritz Lang's significantly harder movie Clash of Night, made a year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
