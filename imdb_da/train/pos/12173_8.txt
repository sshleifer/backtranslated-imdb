First a quick 'hold up!' to those who say this movie stinks. You can't go to every movie that expects 'Citizen Kane'. This was actually a funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I don't think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have lived more on it. Apart from that, the movie is fun. Selma Blair has to eat something. She worries me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or ease Saturday afternoon fun. Go see. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 out of ****
