See, this is possibly one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. Hating this movie is hating freedom itself. I remember that the early 80s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. Out of that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Down Beatty's performance in this movie showed that he should never again be cast as a dimensional victim in the desert. His triumph is an inspiration to everyone. The screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
