I've seen this movie about 6 times now. And every time I see it, I'm more impressed with the story and the play. It's like seeing a train wreck that is in progress. Its subtle in its approach, but very effective in achieving its goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the middle of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand, we Vice President Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly tears on the old boys network that is the heart of the great of New York's Administration, and on the other hand, we have the bully Zappati, deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all agents. This situation culminates well in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy for himself by killing himself and Calhoun orders Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains some really good one-liners like (my personal weakness): - You don't summarize a person's life in a moment - The only thing new in this world is the story you don't know. All in all, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
