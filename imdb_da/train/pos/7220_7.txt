Nothing is more comfortable for me than a who-down-it or excitement tale that keeps you guessing throughout how the whole thing will end. And that's exactly what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling game by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). And in that, Michael Santa and Christopher Reeve make the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled out of SLEUTH - with almost as many skills and as many puzzles as ever existed in the exceptionally clever game. <br /> <br /> But because it's supposed to scare you, surprise you and let you guess As far as the result is concerned, it's hard to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is a crazy jealous playwright whose latest games have failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the handwriting of the manuscript, Caine recognizes that he leaves it as his own, would solve all his problems and regain his reputation. <br /> <br /> From then on, it's a fun and games issue for the audience, as Ira Levin's story turns off and steers Agatha Christie for the number of turns. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play brilliantly from each other, each with a certain dynamic thrill of narration as well as some humorous details that come from a script that captivates drama with humor. Summary: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the end.
