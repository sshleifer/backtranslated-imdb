Typically, "children" have some annoying quality for what makes it too juicy and unbearable to anyone over 13. But again, it is before Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the same moments that there is often a movie about the kids mentioned above, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The action was decent and the unpleasant dynamics Stanley had with some of the other campers were more realistic than what most movies are trying to portray. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this movie didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most could imagine, like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive ending). The only down side? Hokey sees lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.
