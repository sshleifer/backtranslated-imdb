Ok, it is basically a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the start it is obvious that it has been aimed at a great intelligence. You can count about 10 clich√©s that the movie builds up on, but it only delivers about three of them, and a few of them have a twist to those who let you know once again that the director hasn't assumed you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's play is truly amazing and brings a depth of character, which is surprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
