49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with fever 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health gradually deteriorated as a number of mysterious "black outs" grabbed her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a deserted area where only one disease-invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) resides. When a dark, unknown danger threatens its idyllic "paper house", Marc's life is threatened. Her life is also in danger, as these dreams reflect her own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Haunting first debut feature of British director Bernard Rose. Engaged by a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, it leaves plenty of other "original" fantasy works in the wake. When a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give it a mix of fable and reality to make it work in film form. Director Rose successfully captures the fantasy world aspect with a darkness that aims to encourage them. <br /> <br /> Feverishly scored by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with professionally timed "jumping out of your seat" moments. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this important aspect of scaring the audience not to know what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures excitement and never lets it go or fall into the next series of events. Also, his mastery of placing objects within the frame (as in his P.O.V. shots) gives the cinematography an extra dimension that otherwise seems to be lacking. Only in Europe will you find such scary places as those presented here: The lonely house, the fields, the coastal towns, the guard tower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose wanted to follow this movie with "Candyman" (1992), a real 'thinking person's horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.
