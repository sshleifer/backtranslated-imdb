A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up characters and backgrounds for "Enterprise", "prequel" for the original "Star Trek" series. It sometimes stumbles into the "Trek" convention and clich√© - candy-colored space removers never seem to go out of style, and I can already predict snickering references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are generous, and you can already see hints that this crew member must be more resourceful in different ways than in previous (later?) series. Scott Bakula strikes the right tone as captain with Church's brashness and boldness, but without his passion and swagger, and I look forward to the way the series will include engineer, gunsmith and communications officer (not just a glorified telephone operator anymore) as supporting players. The authors seem to have picked up the big mistake in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a large ensemble cast and giving characters a short run, it begins with a smaller core of signs that a little more variety can be added later - as I hope that after more than half a dozen episodes need more variety.
