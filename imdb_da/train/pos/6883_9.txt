In rare cases, there comes a movie that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a movie. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the movie industry. She saw it another time with me. We were both enthralled. Her as if for the first time again. "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment when all your drama began to take place. It does so while being relentlessly entertaining. Bret Carr's performance and pacing as an instructor won't let you off the screen. He crafted a character that disarms with a bugs rabbit like stuttering innocence, but warmly worn with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you are watching a movie. When the epiphon strikes the brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this movie is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation. It is a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
