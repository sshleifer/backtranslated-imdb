A cute fun story of 2 people crossing paths while preparing their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall into each other in this great New York setting, even though they are married to other people. Perhaps a little bit is that the "partners" are both types of A personalities, while our main characters are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but it made me smile. And hello to the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle and the whales - sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!
