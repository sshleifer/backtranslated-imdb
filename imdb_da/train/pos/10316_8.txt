Remember these two stories with joy and in the first, which lies in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for the exam day, the state i.q test. The boy is a little confused about the parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done so and eventually go to the test. On arrival he gets an injection and is curious about why. The investigator smiles and tells him it's just to make sure he's telling the truth. The boy then wondered, why would he not? It is later, and the parents are waiting with concern on the screen when a message appears and declaring that the state is sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and politely asks that they will suffer a private funeral. A cork of a closing scene! A charity message was a heartwarming story of a fluke mental connection between a girl of the past and a guy from the present. That goes into a strange story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delve into the pages of history in the present. A lovely story with a warm view.
