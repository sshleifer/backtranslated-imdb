Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys with Walter Matthau and George Burns is a fun comedy about the strange band of life and its shortness, but the laughter is always bitter taste. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), are two great theatrical comedy actors now reduced to the imbecity of the harsh and incessant old age, you can only feel anger and blue. Willy never surrenders and continues to see work while Al is tired of players, and he is retired to the country house of his daughter. The couple in his old age were really funny and harmonious, but out of the scene there was a continuation of bias and arguing, and for eleven years after their bride they do not speak between. Now, if they wanted to work, they'll have to come back together again to make one of his best old sketches for a comedy story TV show. The meetings are explosive and liberating for the old questions. Neil Simon's manuscript gives some corrosive spirit to the story, and the melancholy and blue overwhelming many gags and laughter managed to create a good mix also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu (Oscar nomination as Best Actor) and George Burns (Won Academy Award as best support actor). The two actors are very credible and real, and their harmony almost works as they really work together for all the time and the realty they don't carry between them. The film is very touching also for its whole consuming reality, as the story tells, and how the report Love-Heat, which binds the two actors, is quite part in the strange but at the same time commonly understandable things in life. My rate is 7.
