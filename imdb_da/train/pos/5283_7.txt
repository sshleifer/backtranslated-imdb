The prerequisite for this movie is simple, and it is also the script: An older Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his corresponding older station wagon from France to shark in Mecca, Saudi Arabia so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim commitment before he dies . The father is obviously very religious, but his son is unimpressed; He accepts his father's obligation over religion, he would rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things the son does not understand, and the petulance between them is the unity that maintains the drama, although it is often rather annoying. But like any good road movie, there are oddball characters along the way; For example, a woman on a backroad in Croatia, being asked about directions to Belgrade just comes in the back seat and points with her hand pronouncing a word that they suppose to be somewhere but can't find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man they ask directions for confirming he can speak French but then give a comprehensive comment in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in a country sackcloth eating egg sandwiches and wanting meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (maybe fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughter ritual. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.
