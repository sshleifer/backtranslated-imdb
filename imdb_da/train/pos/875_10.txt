Well, what can I say I just saw this amazing movie when my nerves are still jangling! Jacques Audiard the director must make a name for himself in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise, and Emmanuelle Devos is also no Penelope Cruz, but these two are great actors, and it is a thrilling and compelling thriller that starts slowly with some clever character buildings and then begins to add tension to the excitement of a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays their role in perfection, the director, the actors, right down to the camera man, and everything seems so right, not stupid gun game, the fighting when it happens so credibly, The expressions, the emotions, it is almost like you are there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, download the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the lights on, take the phone out of the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
