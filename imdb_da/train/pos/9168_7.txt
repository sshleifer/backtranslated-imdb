This was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with it was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane feel very honest. In the book Jane seemed to be a much stronger character. I was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. The part where it is the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice by throwing her. but the Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. He makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the 80s for television. If it had been a feature film and better quality, it would have been perfect. However, my main complaint is that Zelah Clarke was too old.
