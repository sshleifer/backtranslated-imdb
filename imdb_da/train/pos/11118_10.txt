The "gangster" genre is now a worn subject that is too often exposed to parody. Gradually, the series is a culmination of past clichés that have been used in its genre. Fortunately, the authors have advanced on this error by creating a realism that has been applied to it. The Soprano is an epic case of fact, which illustrates that it is satisfied with the psychological depth of subtle nuance, humor and irrational violence. The protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a dangerous general deprivation of fear and moral values ​​of his crew member, but Tony is of two personas who are bestial while the other is in conflict with guilt and anger. Without incidents or contradictions, I still believe that the Sopranos have the finest ensemble cast of recent memory. All in all, I could make a detailed statement about the series, but I will not. If there is ever a visual dictionary in global consumerism, look for these definitions vital, ambiguous, unsustainable, epic, uncompromising, and the soprano crushed visage is smiling right back on you.
