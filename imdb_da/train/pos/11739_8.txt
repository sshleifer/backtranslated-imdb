"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) goes away from her job as a television horror movie hostess, after the new station's owner is fresh with her. She is now dependent on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns to come up with more money to get the show started. Things seem hopeless to raise the money until she is told of her aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read the will. A house that needs repairs, a dog and a cookbook, is all that is left by her aunt, and again, it seems that Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. Adults in the small and narrow minded city do worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will make friends with her. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) presses into an agreement with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful heritage, which includes spellcasting and a couple of very effective stews. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get it by knowing his power. Elvira is then faced with being burned by the spell on the city's old witchcraft and the incident between her and uncle. The reason is pretty simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep it moving at a good pace. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of sweet, brutal, bawdy and clever humor carried out by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs and parodies. The film's touches of occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well-made movie with great plays by all artists; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (of "Fat.") There are also good special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is nice, yes!
