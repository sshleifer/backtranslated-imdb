Several television films should be made like this. I saw it back in '93, when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both fantastic, giving very gritty and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good and he became an exceptionally scary and underrated achievement as the child's molester / killer. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also instructed "Hoosiers", who were somehow both formal and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same strong, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that aren't predictable and full of abuse, watch it if you can. The side story of Hunt and Fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story.
