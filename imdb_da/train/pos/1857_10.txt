This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already expected. It was definitely a heartbreaking spectacular movie. It's a great story, with amazing actors and creators. Another great movie with Denzel Washington. (shouldn't surprise anyone) Derek Luke also did a wonderful job.
