"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I'm in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt it?" "If you were in your office right now" I have this face-to-face conversation. "<br /> <br /> Bourne remains the street hard and creepy. Only his inhuman resilience leads the film too far into imagination. Conversation is macho , to the point of only shards of Bond type gallows humor. It is about the action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something is happening on another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so Well, a scene in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist makes this a big impact. There's nothing of the worlds - you're in it or just a superfluous body. <br /> <br /> If the shaking cam doesn't annoy you too much , enjoy this movie and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.
