When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and finally found it at my local DVD store, I thought "Well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image". These guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B - Pictures over the past few months, but also some very disappointing films. So I didn't expect much, especially after seeing the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" proved to be an excellent revival of the 1950's monster movie. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, male plants and of course we have the creature, a great mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing missing is graphic sex scenes and nudity that you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for television, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. And it doesn't matter anyway, because "Hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at its best. There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster is not so often, and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, William Forsythe just not the right guy for the "hero" part and to fall in love with the beautiful Hunter Tylo. Apart from that, I highly recommend this movie to any monster movie fan out there. Take a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
