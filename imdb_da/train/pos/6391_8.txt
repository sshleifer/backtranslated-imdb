Captured this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I didn't expect much (though the festival director told me it was one of the best movies posted). Five minutes into it I was sold. Shot in B&W on a shoestring budget, this movie is hilarious. The play is solid, the writing is solid and the film's appearance is solid. The play is probably the greatest revelation, as most movies shot at low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey plays. Not this one. It has one of the most compelling, endearing and fun portrayals of a character with Tourette's syndrome I've ever seen. The plot coincides without being confusing and raunchy without being free. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hoping I got the right one) deserve the chance to stretch their stuff to a wider audience.
