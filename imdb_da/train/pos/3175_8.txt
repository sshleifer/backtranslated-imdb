It's great how this movie pulls you together. I honestly laughed. You don't care that it's low budget because it works for me. To be honest, my wife didn't really go the same way, but she prefers another type of movie. However, she admitted that it was very creative and well-composed and probably all on a shoe string. These signs, whose lives are strange and uneasy, give me something to relate to in my own world. Just keep going and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. By watching this movie a second and third time, I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed me through the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway liked it. Hope to see more.
