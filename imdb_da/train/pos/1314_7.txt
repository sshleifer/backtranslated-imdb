When a small town is threatened by a child murderer, a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved in the killer, her psyche begins to strike, causing her to lose focus on the job of catching criminals. Not a movie with high voltage, but solid policing and a good depiction of a psychotic loser's flawed mind.
