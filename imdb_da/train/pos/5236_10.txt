This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story in a story '. The protagonist is the scriptwriter Bart Klever, who is constantly struggling with his new text ?? which at the same time is the play of the film we see. In the film, Bart plays a screenwriter who writes the script of the film? Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative topic, just like the environment in the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment provides ample opportunity for games with illusion involving space, light, colors and a few cats. The outward-looking space of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text constantly influenced by filmmaking interventions displayed on a computer screen and serving as a counterpart to the equality environment. The constantly changing point of view complicates answers to questions that arise: What is "truth" and what ?? illusion? Which of the observed worlds are primary and better than the rest? Can something act as a basic orientation point in the narrative area?
