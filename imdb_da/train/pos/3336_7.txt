I have to admit that I entered the fever pitch with low expectations. It's no big revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the Fever Pitch trailers were okay, but didn't make me fascinating. I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review ... "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was beaten one in his movie career. Well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! Another strike and that is back to SNL! "or" Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets for Fever Pitch. You'll go out of the theater and never go back! " Then the film had to go and be much more entertaining than I expected. But hey, I couldn't let my puns go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I wouldn't watch the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of Pedro Martinez's name continually sends me to the bathroom. Oh, hold on ... <br /> <br /> ... Okay, I'm back. Anyway, my mother who is a St. The Louis Cardinals fan still believes the World Series was rigged last year. She refuses to believe that Sox won it legitimately. But I'm probably enough to admit that Fever Pitch has made me sympathize, albeit little, with the situation of Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie at some level. Unless you have a favorite sports retreat, you can't quite understand the extreme heights and falls that a fan like Fallon's Leg can go through. There is nothing quite as fresh as the scent of a new season and nothing as smooth as a pure slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It's the joy of being a sports fan. "Wait" next year, "will be your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch will actually capture that essence. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against real background of the Red Sox's unlikely World Series run last year, i love it not so much that i want to marry it but you know what i mean .. i expected this to be handled in a rather cheesy way and while something of humor is a bit stupid, it is actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old and when he died he left his two Ben has not missed a game for 23. At the beginning of each season, he has a draft day where he and his friends meet to find out who is going to play with him. makes everyone dance to the Yankees games, and when someone complains, he threatens them with tickets to the games with Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and Devi In the rays, it's a very good scene, and it works so well because I actually know of people who do the "ticket day". I must also admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents. The Red Sox plays a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV, Ben decides to lose it. One of the most dangerous things in life is losing a game and then being in the public and trying to avoid hearing the result. Been there. It is a very tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy pops up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts screaming like a banshee so as not to hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassed and her parents do not know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny it. But it is right. <br /> <br /> Now if you expect the raw, edgy stuff the Farrelly brothers are known for, then you may be disappointed. However, they have their moments, as when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes speaks out of the mouth, "like a sweet stroke victim", but generally it is a softer and more romantic side that bridges put on the screen . <br /> <br /> That's not to say the movie ever gets too juicy. Luckily, when the juice starts to ooze a little, Farrellys knows when to pull away. A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the track and running over to Ben to declare his incredible love for him, turns to Ben with the right answer: "You must tell me the off-road. Is it spongy?" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can do well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore is still a constant source of romantic comedy charm. Fever pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a little new look at the romantic comedy genre. It's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to. Especially the guys who practice sports fanatics at some point during the year and the ladies who have to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Now that the red sox fans could please hugging the "curse of bambino" would appreciate it. My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship so I officially declare my situation bigger than yours. <br /> <br /> GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sports fanaticism should generally consider giving fever pitch a look. I wouldn't go out of my way to hurry up and see it at the first free time, but it will make a good matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
