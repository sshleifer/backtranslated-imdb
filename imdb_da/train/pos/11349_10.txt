This movie can have a dubious pedigree because it was made for television, but it is one of the best movies I've seen. The movie and its actors won several awards. It's gripping, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely. The story of a chase for a killer in the Iron Curtain Russia by people who are willing to risk their career trying to save the victims of the future would be a convincing story if it were fiction - but that is apparently a true story. I highly recommend it.
