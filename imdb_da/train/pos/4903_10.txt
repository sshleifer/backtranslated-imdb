Inspired at least by the Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, which performed throughout the war at the Covent Garden Opera House, this film chronicles an elderly saxophone player attempting to reform it almost every girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl at the end 2nd world War. Too short backlinks to the original band on stage give us wonderful music and help fill out the background of the band members and especially the girls' relationship with the lonely male member - their transvestite drummer (who tries to evade the call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turn into excellent leading performances like the recent widow Elizabeth, and the related, female Patrick, drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, who now plays bar piano on the ocean side, and June Whitfield lights up as the thrombon's Salvation Army. Cameo performances of other greats such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a body down memory path, with an all star cast of what should by all rights be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look so good in their age! Especially Leslie Caron is still an incredible fox who is 69 years old. She still gets my pulse! As I saw it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. Afterwards I saw these girls up and discovered that each of them is old enough to have played in London in 1944 (though it may be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing bands, thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how well a woman can do with almost three-quarters of a century behind her, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />
