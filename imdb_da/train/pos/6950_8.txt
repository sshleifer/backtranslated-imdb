On the day of the Presidential President of California, between midnight and 1:00, Spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Federal Agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and is having trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, blaming his mother Teri for putting Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they find that the girl has come home. While attempting to solve his domestic problem, Jack is called to his Counter Terrorist Unit by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with their chief Richard Walsh, revealing a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who runs for president, and they have to to find the slider. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and tells that there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find the associations. When an aircraft explodes over the Mojave desert, Jack has an additional problem to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I've seen this show, and I admit that I liked what I've seen: a complex and dramatic story with more and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: Find a killer to protect an important politician; Find a traitor in his agency and find his teenage daughter who is in trouble while trying to save his marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
