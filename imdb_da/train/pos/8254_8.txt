Viewed in a middle-class neighborhood of the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with an easy touch toy with such American occupations as gun mania and violence, materialism and quit Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and disposal of the dead. Yes, it sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it's almost as bright as a feather. Zombies are prominent among the characters. Essential issues arise as: who gets zombie (90% of Willard people choose this last road, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies make their bid as robots (they have become a sign of social status)? And what is the scope of possible relationships that can be drawn between the living and the kind of reincarnated death? Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also wrote the lively manuscript (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), holds the unlikely material that percolating together for an hour and a half without even getting lost due to a good laugh. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the protagonists, supported by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent child with a good heart acting as a fair witness to all the bad of the adults. (Having seen her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such fine comedienne chops.) Production design and music are exquisite fifties for a tee. Maybe this is not for everyone. It will definitely be a tough movie to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that remain fun from start to finish are among the hardest-won performances in film making. For me anyway, "Fido" is a hoot! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Set on 01/30/07)
