Outstanding fun for both adults and children, this movie works on many levels: everything from car offenses and cakes in the face to some very good (but subtle) jokes to adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is with her sublime evil best as Cruella ('call me Ella') De Ville. After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behavior Modification Clinic is she cured of her desire for fur? even the puppy skin leather she had so intensely wanted. She even has all her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" movie without undercutting and machinations by Cruella, and you know something will change her behavior modification. And now she needs an extra puppy (then 102 dalmatians) to complete her scary scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the movie's hero, running the "Second Chance" dog's shelter. Although he was in the `Titanic 'and last year's television version (like Pip) of` Great Expectations', I did not recognize him; Well, he was Fifth Officer Lowe 'in the' Titanic 'and I didn't see' great expectations', so I'm not terribly surprised. Gerard Depardieu makes a wonderful trip as the Furrier bench by Cruella. He prances and positions in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you've ever seen ?? and do it well. His 'Wicked Witch of the West' greeting is fun. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is amazing, is Cruella's not so bad henchman ?? He was also Alonzo, 'Cruella's butler, in' 101 Dalmatians' and you can also recognize him from all the 'Black Adder' Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, slightly bad character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given for whole costuming in a movie. This is unfortunate as the clothes worn by Glenn Close are fantastic ?? It's incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. Her clothing alone deserves at least one Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart ?? But comparing this movie to the original animated movie is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the movie version of "101 Dalmatians" that came out in 1996. There is a lot to do here: from the sight gags, the dialogue and costumes to casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
