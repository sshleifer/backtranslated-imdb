Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an entertaining parody of Indiana Jones and other fairy tales popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford stars like Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights evil perpetrators wherever he comes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they globe trot and are looking for some actions (and some decent story lines). The duo meets with a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slave dealer (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her siblings? <br /> <br /> A juicy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something it's not. I have to give this a recommendation. That's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
