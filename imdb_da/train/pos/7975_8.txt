I just love Malles documentary. They are so effortless and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for mankind, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just can't help but fall in love with them too. <br /> <br /> Malle recorded most of it in 1979. He came back 6 years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this little addition does well. It may sound like Malle did just what was done in the Up series, but it is not. The Up series is about people. Malles weight is not so much on what happened to each person, but what happened to this society. And the change is good. 1985, the Reagan era and the peasants suffer. Once a proud society, no one sees much in the future at all, and the parents hope their children will educate themselves and do something other than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crises began today because of what happened then. Just take a look at these last words in the movie, spoken by an older lawyer from the city (in 1985): "Now I have great hopes for this country because the things that are happening right now I can only be characterized in my heart as an obsession of greed And a nation does not live long with that occupation, and especially a democracy there ... There is good - there is good - very good in this country and a lot of good people and they do not come - they do not want to subscribe to This greed philosophy is now going on. It's terrible. "Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before it happened.
