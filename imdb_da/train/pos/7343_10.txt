Why this movie has all vanished into obscurity is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better. The brutal violence, cool character design and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies. It is definitely the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience I've ever seen. This does not look like Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It is quite a departure for Bakshi, and in my opinion his best work. I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.
