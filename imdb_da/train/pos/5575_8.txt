I don't expect much from this, but I have to admit that I rolled on the ground laughing a few times during this movie. If you are not grossly offended for the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. That's if you are the type that will like to see Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. It is certainly not a remarkable comedy work, but given the low budget income, this is masterful. To smooth out the playing field for comparison, imagine all the study movies with their budgets cut by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network to see this through. I'm looking forward to his next effort.
