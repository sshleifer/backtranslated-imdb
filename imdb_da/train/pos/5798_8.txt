I saw the first thing when they showed this around Easter time 1993/4 and didn't think much about it, then I bought this on DVD last summer when I started to enter Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now I'm older. It's a good movie, but it won't be this classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There was a disturbing scene like the little girl Katie was beaten by gangster Frankie Lideo, who was played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael became a robot. My favorite song on the movie was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
