Holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education. I didn't think I wanted a children's novel; Plus, the other few books I had to read to the class were really bad. But to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It is truly one of the most perfectly written novels I have ever read. I think it has the rare quality that does it for the benefit of pre-teens, teens and adults. Anyone who reads it, I think will go away a better person. Although I can't quite say it to the movie, I'm happy to say they got the right thing. I don't think the viewers of the movie will go away as enriched, but they will surely be entertained without the side effect being stupid when they sit down. It's an intelligent story, and it's very well told. I think it moves a little too fast. The novel takes more time to develop the characters. And flashbacks come in and out so fast that they don't have too much time to register. Interracial romance in the past feels more clich√© and pace than it does in the novel. And the end, which ties together all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of the absurdity that doesn't quite exist in the movie. It seems much better. I also don't like the many pop songs. I want Disney to not feel such a necessity to sell soundtracks. Casting is over-the-board excellent, from the young kids to the old benefits. Jon Voight is particularly great. Not quite sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze, though. 10.9.
