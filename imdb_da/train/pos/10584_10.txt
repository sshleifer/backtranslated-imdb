"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on so many levels. There is no way the supposed "theatrical prologues" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course. Think of the large pools and three-storey high fountains to "At a waterfall" for example. (Berkeley instructed John Garfield in "They made me a criminal" six years later and had Dead End Kids singing "By a Waterfall" as they took their showers.) "Shanghai Lil" is the best production number in the picture. It is a catalog of '30s Warner Bros' sensitivities. Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see black integrated into a social scene in other movies during the period, unless they were carriers of a train or girls in a large house. Here are the black guys sitting in the bar and singing with the others. I also get a thrill when the military dancers make a "short section" presentation of Roosevelt's image. There is also the NRA Eagle logo for the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal. FDR was the new president, and hopes were so high that he would pull the nation out of depression. You will never see anything so the working class oriented out of the MGM, of course. Warner Bros. supported wholeheartedly uplift dictated by F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she plays the Chinese hooker, "Lil." She hardly looks at her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature errors. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code stuff is fun. The number "By a waterfall" is wonderful in that respect. The girls switch to their swimsuits at the crowded bus speed through Times Square with all its lights on. The scattered eagle girls swim over the camera giving the kind of crayons that would not be seen for 35 years. Within a few months, the production code will eliminate such cheeky pleasures.
