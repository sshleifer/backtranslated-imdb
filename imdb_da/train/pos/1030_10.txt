I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best TV sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind, because unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent development of plot and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that linked all the episodes. In many ways you can usually see the shows completely out of order with no difficulty understanding what is happening. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took off in the last season) and the second TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This connection seems to have evolved as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this even more with SG-1. The bottom line is that this series was, in many ways, like seeing a family or a long novel slowly taking shape. Sure, there were a few "throwaway" episodes that were not related to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually quite fun. <br /> <br /> And it was fun, I loved SG -1 kept the stamp from time to time and wasn't so terribly serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really bad, he slowly faded from the series in later seasons. <br /> <To truly appreciate SG-1, you should see it from the beginning and see how intricate the plots work. This connection gives the show exceptional resilience. And if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, sci-fi is probably not the genre for you.
