As a collector of film memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this movie, which now, as I have finally seen it, must be the best thing about it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch picture of the merchant. But there is nothing terrible to put in your video recorder than one and a half long picture of the merchant. At first I thought this movie was pure waste, but then I realized that it had some qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most wishy-washy persona ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so tired, it's incredible! ("It's amazing! He seems to be stronger when he melts!) <br /> <br /> And could anyone tell me how well they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely And exactly what their plan is to "help" him? If this movie was meant to scare the audience, I think it missed its call.
