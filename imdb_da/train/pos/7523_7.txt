I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie and not a movie, as it apparently was shot by HBO to appear on their cable network sometime this year. This film presents Side as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B & D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that, and the movie touches some of her other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the 50's pinup icon. This film is supposedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It's shot in black and white for the 1950's nostalgia feel. I have the book called "Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend", which has many beautiful pictures that chronicle the career at Page, and I must say that this film reproduces on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of the famous photos are very accurate. Mol itself with Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she have Bettie Page look, but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera perfectly. And her body is as close to a replica of pages as possible. Great casting. The story is a bit thin and tabloidesque and could certainly have been much better. But this is a pretty good movie. I would rate it a 7.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend it to watch when it comes to television.
