Unfortunately, this movie has long been inaccessible (as other posters have noticed), but this is one of the major dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love, located in a shanty city. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, which are only about the best of their careers, and is a prime example of how Director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost adventurous aura on elements of poverty, crime and horrible social inequality that just shows how romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love survives in the midst of bias and desperate need, and it is totally conscious of life. This is a real masterpiece of the period, and is a movie that deserves to be known.
