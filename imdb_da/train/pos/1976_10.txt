The man who instructed "The Third Man" also instructed the "Who Will Buy" sequence in "Oliver!" Now it's talent. <br /> <br /> I raise my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that "other units" are involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br/> <br /> I suppose the quality is coming out. <br /> <br /> (It shows in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoiler - everyone must see Oliver! for the first time once].) How many lines should I write. <br /> <br /> Encourage people to write too much. <br /> I hope this counts as "10th line".
