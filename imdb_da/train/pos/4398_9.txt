When I heard this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This Taiwanese instructor broke into fame with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and moved on to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now he is turning his attention to another American icon - the civil war. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, an EU state of southern sympathy. These were never officially joined to the Confederate army. Instead, they formed outlaw bands, called "bushwhackers", they grew hair long and sometimes confiscated Union uniforms that they had on their regular clothes. <br /> <br /> The film depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times and their supposed heroic missions to kill the builders and peasants who supported the Union. There are no stars in this movie unless you consider the "Jewel" singer, well cast as a young confederate widow as a star. Tobey Macquire is thrown like a young German farm pillow, emptied of his inheritance, because the Germans were assumed to be sympathizers of the Union. This young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh-looking youth, whose accomplishments include his marvel and subtle accomplishments when he is exposed to the war horror. Jeffrey Wright is a liberated slave who travels with bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. He gives a fine and undervalued performance. <br /> <br /> However, some of the actors are wood, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. And their costumes are for new ones. And the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and hat-tipping and courtesy for women comes across as a bit - especially because they make it a point to murder all the men they pull from their women's arms and then burn down in the shops and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I don't think this will go down as one of Lee Angs' "big" movies, I found myself fascinated by it, despite the slow parts and its great length in 140 minutes. I was interested in what happened next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect people caught in the forces of history. Not as much action as the usual war movie, but still recommended - especially to civil war talk. <br /> <br />
