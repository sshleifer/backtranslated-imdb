The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's political film, Antonioni's American film. Stylistically, it follows "Blow-up", which means the pace is faster than the previous epics, but certainly no less idiosyncratic. Basically, the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> The two main characters come from very different environments. Mark from the "rebellious" youths, Daria from a real estate agency. But in true Antonioni mode, they are both alienated, both trying to escape their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting with rebel students and black panther disappointed with the verbal empty rhetoric while Daria is uneasy on the move with his car. <br /> <br /> After portraying the rebellious youth as confused and shallow, Antionioni, the master leader, moves to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, advertising magazines, meaninglessness, which must continue to accommodate the corresponding expansion of the population that generates a profit at the same time. It is this environment that the two main characters escape from, although it seems to be random. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria stops at a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just as stifling, and the people just like lost cases, best exemplified by an old book holiday, are now reduced to a shadow by itself, sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. An astounding melancholy sequence made even more powerful by the involvement of some half-wild children who lived around was introduced by some "charity" but "destroyed a true piece of American history". In a not so unclear symbolism there is Antonioni's opinion about the hippies. Just a half positive insight into the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> Then there is the desert, the landscape has been devastating, conversely clean and scary, unshakable, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two protagonists love "joined" in the imagination of the "flower" generation reflects the corresponding sequence in the "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells her son a story. It is a colorful break in a colorless landscape. A living half-fantasy in a stifling reality. The end probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in the cinema, the western civilization blew to pieces. And catharsis, and exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (the British "Blow-Up" and the US "Zabriskie Point") are less effort than the previous masterpieces, but this is largely due to the faster pace and the inevitably set settings (swinging London, floral America). But when it comes to that, it's clear he hasn't lost the edge.
