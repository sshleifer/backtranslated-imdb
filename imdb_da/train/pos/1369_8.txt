I loved this movie and I am one of the older people who shouldn't enjoy it or think so. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These kind of movies are never. But strangely there is a message in it. It is that each of us has the potential to be what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is amazing in this movie. I always thought she had some similarity to Katharine Hepburn's face. So it's great to see both Hepburn and Posey filming librarians (Hepburn's The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 8. It's not in any way a good movie with movie standards, though there are some good pictures in it. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
