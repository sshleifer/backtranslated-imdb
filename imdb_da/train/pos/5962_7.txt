I've seen a killing of "80s rocker horrors" over the years from garbage as "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously fun beads like "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Somehow I managed to keep this one away, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well-received. Now I finally got it with it, and it's easily the best of this for the most awful (but almost always endearing!) Subgenre. The reason (which was largely lifted in the movie "Black Roses") relates to a muldeted misfit named Eddie, which is ridiculed by everyone in his high school for his taste in music. He loves the 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late big Tony Fields.) After Sammi is killed, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gives him Sammi's final recording. When Eddie plays the record backwards, he discovers that he is a little harder and bad things start to happen to those who speak him. Is Sammi's music obsessed? "Trick or Treat" is well made and a total hoot. The special effects are amazing, although it has the typical 80's laser beams. I grew up in the 80s, and while I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the city's legend of playing a record backwards and hearing the sound of Satan's worship. Haha! I also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it is very fun to see them both making cameos as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If I had only seen this movie as a child! While the movie seems to be joking on the popular connection of the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really looks why Sammi Curr is back from the dead and creates chaos and kills the one who gets in the way. This is the movie's weakest point, but if you can overlook it, it's lots of fun.
