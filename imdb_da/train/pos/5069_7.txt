The film is more about pony than gray owl. It's also about Aboriginal, Canada, the English, Gray Owl's aunts and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl, who admits his imposture to Pony and her reaction. <br /> <br /> A few observations about user ratings. Note that the user ratings are bi-polar clustering at 5 and 7; It is not for everyone but has a strong successor. This film is undervalued and overlooked, but will be noticed in the coming years. Also, few women have seen the movie, but they judge it more highly than men. Has it been marketed properly? <br /> <br />
