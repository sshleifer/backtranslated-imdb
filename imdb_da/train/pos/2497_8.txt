In fact: drug abuse, stock shots, 'Matrix' esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and a lonely vampire - all in the same movie - seems like a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what 'Moon Child' is and more. While all of these elements are combined, it may sound like the perfect subject for a B-day combat movie, "Moon Child" pulls it off with just a few expected bumps and hitches along the way. <br /> <br /> The movie has a gritty, completely independent sense of it, jumping from one scene to the next, not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds that glimpse the character's life and scarcely scratches on one true plot. But the film makes no excuses, but instead the story turns into one of friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all sugar-laden in the above elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE as the gloomy vampire 'Kei' is excellent and gives depth to the character and balances Gackt's all-encompassing play as 'Sho', an orphan who turns to Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines like the avenged 'son' who befriends an adult Sho. The story is about these characters and their extended friends and family through various periods of their lives, and how easy friendship can easily be transformed into grief and fraud. <br /> <br /> While the action is sometimes too unrealistic and special effects appear only to show itself, one thing that the film never does is supposed to be about the very popular Asian singers it has. The superstars as actors have their faults, as do their characters. The movie rarely gets boring and ends where it should, after jumping a lot. 'Moon Child' is pretty entertaining, humorous at times and even very touching: it's definitely worth your time!
