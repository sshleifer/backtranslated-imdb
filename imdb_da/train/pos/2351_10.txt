First, I would like to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is terrible. What makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You don't need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be a moment. Where has the wonder of childhood whimsical stories gone, like A Wrinkle in Time. I say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay-it-all-out TVs, which makes no room for imagination or entertainment. It's nice to add a little escapism to the TV experience. Hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. The 1950s-esque setting, the innocent and rare characters and the nature and the physical setting not intended to be taken as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbidity of mortality while others embrace it. Entertaining, other TV shows have taken a back shelf for this series. It has really restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder on television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
