Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter, summoned by a friend to his property in Ireland to investigate some strange pharaohs. The game is set in Ireland after World War II, so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. Our hero is ambidexterous, so he can use both hands at the same time: he throws poles with his right arm and uses his guns with his left. So you can shoot and throw magic at the same time as you understand much fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are good and they can run very well on a medium power P.C..Level design is also cool and atmospheric. For the most part, the game is about the covenant's property and the palace, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you move on. Thanks to the talent Clyve Barker has played a great story and plot (something very rare for a First person shooter), and I said before a big and very ghostly mood that the voting is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main errors. First and foremost, it is quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, to go to this room, all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those leading to your mission room, this can save time but it limits your freedom of exploration . Second, all weapons antiques cannot appeal to most fps players accustomed to high tech weapons. As for difficulties, the game is very well-balanced. Most of it is of medium difficulty, but sometimes it becomes harder, but not frustratingly difficult. Overall undying is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
