Don't be fooled by the stupid title people, this is a sweet ride! A true sequel to Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem starts with a bang and puts on thick until the credits roll. It seems that aliens take over people's organs and change them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game to entertain their kind. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. It is mostly for plot, but who cares when gore is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of slime were used, but it is disgusting to see. There is interesting and effective use of stop-motion when the takeovers are in progress and loving care is plentiful on all creatures and make-up effects. CGI is a bit limited, but it does not slightly detract from overall quality, at least for me. This was really a fun and belly-turning movie that deserves great praise, and has really earned its place in the stack of cult classics. Find it and see you won't be disappointed!
