This is one of my favorite movies all the time. I read the book and liked it, but this movie expands everything the book made famous. The action is amazing, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This film has a certain way of telling which keeps you connected all the way through to the end, where everything is pulled together for a good ending. I also love the way this is controlled by blinking back and forth between the present and Stanley's ancestral stories. The story is written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for movies, and Andrew Davis does a good job. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.
