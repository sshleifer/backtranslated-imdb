More features of this movie immediately date it. The sound is pretty sharp and you are aware of the great progress made in the sound reproduction in the following years. The language of the dialogue is rather picturesque and unnatural, and the play is still reminiscent of the transition from the stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all of her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. However, I feel that the cockney accent somehow does not fit the facial expression. I think it's the supposed cockney accent that isn't right for me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to dive into human dramatic intensity relationships that will delight all movie guests. As in so many of her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hate. Leslie Howard is well-cast as the retired English artist with a club foot who desperately seeks a partner and makes a bad choice in an award-winning little waitress. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. They cross through traffic unaware of a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them. This scene is supposed to be fun, but I find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious movie. It is probably interpreted to send you home with a smile on your face. And as much as we can see (and hope) it is a happy end.
