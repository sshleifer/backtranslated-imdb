Damn, it was a lot to take in. I was pretty fascinated all the way through. It was pretty perfect though I would say that editing had a lot to do with it. I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with many of them (Anton in particular) to get all this recording without any serious ... steak. The Dandy's came from well-managed middle-class children who exploited their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, who might not be what many other people felt. Great piece of film making and great selection of item (s). I recommend it to any music / movie fan. You will probably learn something about film making.
