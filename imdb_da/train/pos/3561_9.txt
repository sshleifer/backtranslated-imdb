At least, something good came out of Damon Runyon's unfair attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. "Guys and Dolls", the apparently indestructible stage musical, was filmed in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and fun movie containing an all-star cast including Vivian Blaine (from the original The Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character has a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in the "Roman Holiday") and two of the full-time major leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently won the Oscars for the Best Support Actor ( "From Here to Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and were at the top of their game. A listener to Brando, who sings "Luck, be a lady tonight", speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as nicely nicely Johnson, bringing down the house with "Sit down, you change the boat." The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoon-like look that anticipates pop art from the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it is quite fun, and even the frightening fun of the terrible army is harmless and reflects no genuine enmity against organized religion. Just watching Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has many other attractions to offer in 149 minutes.
