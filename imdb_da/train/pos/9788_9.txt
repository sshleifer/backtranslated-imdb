I was at the same writer conference and saw the movie. I thought the author - Sue Smith - very clearly summarized what the film was about. However, the film didn't really need explanation. I thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring. A film dealing with the ability to cultivate fear - especially the fear of parental figures - and overcome it, embracing life's possibilities, is a film to be treasured and tasted. I enjoyed it much more than the very hyped 'Somersault.' I also think Mandy62 was a little unfriendly for Hugo Weaving. As a lump about his vintage, I must look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been dull recently, but 'Peaches' supplies the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
