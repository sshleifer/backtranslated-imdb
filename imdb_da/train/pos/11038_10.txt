I was hooked from start to finish. Great fright comes from disturbing images and organic shocks created not to make you jump, but to get you going "What f * ck did I just see?" All the other commentators gave brief summaries of what the film is about, so I won't rehash what has already been said. I told other people about this movie days after I saw it just because it was still ghosting me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I'm a true horror fan, not easily spooked by tripe like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me the bad dreams was the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with these guys. What would my personal fear be? my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are what a good horror thing does for you! The best part of this movie is that it is subtle. It is not about the bogeyme that jumps on you, alien invasions or tons of gore. It is the opposite. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony of the four characters is that horror does not come from an external force that claims it is power over them. Just the men are asking for the only thing they want, and they get it ... but not the way they imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but can ultimately wish they didn't. Sometimes being locked in a prison cell is the best place to be!
