This was a very thought-provoking movie, especially in 1973. At that time, it was actually a huge box office success. After the 1970s, it seemed to be forgotten, but its key messages were too important to disappear completely. It was actually at least fifteen years before its time ... no one had ever heard of the greenhouse effect before 1985 and the controversial object of euthanasia was rarely brought up. <br /> <br /> The sets and special effects could look a little outdated, but big money for sci fi movies was a gamble during that time. If you look closely, you will see everything that usually makes sense. This is a message movie, not for zonked out star wars fans who can't sit through a minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions. This was also Heston's last good movie, the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy. Then it was all blown away disaster pics and large budget amount of appealing garbage bin. It may not be the most entertaining two-hour movie ever made, and the end may be creepy and depressing, but it's hard to find any movie producer with guts that would tackle a topic like this.
