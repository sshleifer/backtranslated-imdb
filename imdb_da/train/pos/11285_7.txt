Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), only more so. There are more of everything, more animals, more varied African tribes and scenes where the thought should be. If it was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan wrestles with crocodiles ?? Crocodile machine spins in the water like a roller bar, around and jaws flapping. Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blown saurian were to stay still. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and an increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wearing larger aperitifs and elephants. In fact, the Indian elephants use far more friendly and train than African with costume ears attached to their heads. Human History: Another white man, worse than the rest, turns out to join Holt to go for ivory from the elephant cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to his death bed. Tarzan intercedes, and the bad guy shoots him? But of course he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone else dies, Holt and the bad guy and every one of their "boys". People are consumable, especially Africans, and there doesn't seem to be much difference between the black comrades who die because they work for the white men traveling through the tabernacle and the black fellows who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays code made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes where Jane swims naked, and although the light flickers the movement, and the flashes are very appealing. Apparently, one of Weismuller's friends from the Olympic swimming team did the naked scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. However, she moves through the film, which carries the same kind of leaf bulb Weismuller wear (plus a bikini top) that shows an excellent look on the thigh and hip. They still don't have to talk much. They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
