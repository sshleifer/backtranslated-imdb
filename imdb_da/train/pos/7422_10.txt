As a prolonged Barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. It also sits, this movie ranks as a classic. It has flaws (highlighted in other posts) but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again and is fascinating to see unfold on the screen. Streisand fought hard to make this movie his own. I don't think she was ever happy. But it gives her fans a new Barbra (currently) with LIVE song, a young fresh look and some very violent actors. <br /> <br /> The story is rough but exciting and keeps your interest all the way through. The extended one frame "finale" is difficult for most non-Barbra fans to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire his talent. <br /> <br />
