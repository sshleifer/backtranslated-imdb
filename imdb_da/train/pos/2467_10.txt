Why didn't this bring a bag full of Oscars? It is a fantastic interpretation of an often filmed / performed piece. The pictures are breathtaking (especially in widescreen ... pan & scan really kills the movie's amazing movie and set). Each frame is a painting. Amazing. The game is almost intact, and Branagh's passion for it is evident from the opening titles. No Zefferelli here, just amazing storytelling way only movies can but rarely do. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's murderous uncle: He doesn't play him as a mustach-curling evil villain, but a charming politician who allows us to see why only Hamlet suspects wrong play. Branagh also seams the subsoil between the line between Hamlet's fake / real madness and the fiery revenge within him. And the many cameos come out well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, discreetly, if you're sucked into Branagh's vision as I was. A fascinating piece.
