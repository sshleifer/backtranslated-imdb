I'm totally dependent on this show. I can't wait until the week passes to see the next view. It is a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show. I want to tune in every week to see it, even though I'm not at home, I always have my vr set to tape monarch cove. Simon Rex is the best actor on the show. It is exciting and exciting. I think this show should stay in the air and I think everyone should tune in to see it. I saw the very first episode and in fact I wouldn't see it, but I saw life one day and I decided to see it because it was on and I absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite program. I really mean it.
