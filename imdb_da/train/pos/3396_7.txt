Very interesting. The big twist was not as big a shock as they might have hoped for, and it was very dated, but it made me work. It really made me think of a world without vegetation or pets and made me appreciate the world I live in much more. Charlton Heston does a great job, like all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. It lacked direction at times, and many of the settings and background needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main error I could find was that I didn't want the movie to end when it did, I'd like to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
