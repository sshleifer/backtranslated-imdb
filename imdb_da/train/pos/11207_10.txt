This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it's not in print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live recordings and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed for a while. * sigh * most recommended.
