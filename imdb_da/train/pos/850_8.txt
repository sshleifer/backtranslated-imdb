THE MATADOR (2005) *** Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a medieval assassin facing a mid-life crisis while being awarded in Mexico, turning to a square yet American businessman (Kinnear at his most gracious) and discover that there is more to life than death. Newcomer filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big-screen debut with a pointy evil black black comedy with a keen eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to look into this fresh air into the "buddy comedy" formula that tells what is expected of his driver and gives Brosnan the opportunity to get his ya-yas out with devilish joy, a sleeping gem indie hit.
