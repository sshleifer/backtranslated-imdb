We bought the DVD phrase "Es war einmal das Leben" / "Once upon a Time ... Life" (English) for our bilingual children, because everyone loved "Es was einmal der Mensch" Once upon a Time .. "Man" (English) series (our parents had seen it as children) and it has exceeded even high expectations! The series is very well made, does not show its age, and our children of different ages really like to see it. Learn the things we didn't know parents before it was much later, the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs, all senses, blood, infection, antibodies and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes. can find "sensible" such as digestion and reproduction is covered in a tasteful, discreet and child-friendly way (the reproductive episode begins to cover primarily where the baby begins to grow) while still (as typical) informative and fun. /> Children are usually fascinated by how their bodies a works and through the episodes understands this in connection with their surroundings. The format of the episodes changes between the outside world (a family of 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the case of infections, the boy cuts accidentally and the wound becomes infected and the episode covers how the body responds to this. Similarly, the episodes of the senses, e.g. hearing, seeing, connecting what is happening within the body to the outside world, and the episode of breathing and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the entire life cycle including (short) where the oxygen comes from (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best ever children's programs - I would say it is a must for any family with children!
