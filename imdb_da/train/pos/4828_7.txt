Rupert Friend gives a performance as Prince Albert, who promises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He's amazing. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and looked at Ruper Friends' eyes, I understood. The film does not take us to his death, but to an event that might very well have cost his life. An act of love. I thought so, or I should tell him. I thought what he felt was real. Nothing or anyone comes anywhere near the delicacy and depth of the friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I didn't think she was Victoria for a moment. No real sense of period. It couldn't have been her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
