Expecting to see a "cute little movie" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, societies and inevitable change have rarely been explored so expertly on film. Each character is solid and I was completely involved in the story. The organization is much more complex than American audiences will be accustomed to. Still, there is no problem following the progression, even while reading subtitles. Jiang Wu, as the delayed brother, is a constantly shining light. Leave your cynicism in your closet. It will be there when you check out.
