Though I tend to agree with the other comments from people who have seen this movie, I am ashamed to say that I like it. Not so often can such a large pile of 80's cardboard be found outside a Wham! video, so it's definitely worth a visit (Â£ 0.79 per night in my local store!). Watch out for the mental illness seams and zipper on the monster's costume, the fact that the "hero" looks very much like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Block: "Finally, we meet Kor ..." Cows: " Exciting, isn't it? "Fantastic !! I also like that although the video box looks quite exciting with pictures of a castle surrounded by raging sea and a dangerous falcon - like a bird carrying a beautiful heroes for safety (including such "interesting and engaging" suggestions for what that is going on in the movie itself, none of them actually happening. No, i'm not talking ... there really is no rage sea or a wild bird, it just tries to make you interested ... classic in my opinion. movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
