A lovely little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag convertible and finishes on a Liverpool waterfront. It's all excitement and waste, as the former spy has to restart his career, as well as getting some serious R&R cataloging birds (how British is that?). <br /> <br /> Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons frolic from London to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he has just been thrown out of MI5 or something and she, you guessed it, is on the run , wrongly accused of murder. There are seedy docks, rolling Lake District hills, sheep, country pubs, coppers lost, waterfalls, a lot of amateur cyclists, rooftop chases and lots of Chinamen (don't ask) and that's all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ... <br /> <br /> .. and an excellent example of British Noir ...
