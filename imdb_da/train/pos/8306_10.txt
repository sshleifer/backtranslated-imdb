In fact, they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard for a most credible essence. The outfits where wonderful and every person sees this movie will surely keep a smile on their face throughout the movie. Although the film is a bit long, it keeps your attention with Little Richard's personality and clothing in mind. The ending should have taken a direction to move Little Richard more into the present where you could see him as he is old in this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I'm concerned, no matter what the other media says.
