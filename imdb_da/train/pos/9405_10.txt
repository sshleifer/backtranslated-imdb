While Hollywood stagnated during the few years after World War II, England developed a very productive film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit" Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) invents a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other companies are likely to go free! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great films that Alec Guinness played before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It is a good look at the overall absurdity of business. If you plan to start any business, consider watching this movie.
