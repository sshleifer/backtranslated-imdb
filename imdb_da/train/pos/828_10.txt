I have noticed that A NEW HOPE and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but this is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation due to Ewoks, but so is many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official picks up Han Solo in debt subfund created when we first met the character of A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> - The emperor was finally revealed: Well okay, it may not work right now, since prequels are out, but that was the first time we saw the emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - Scout Bike Chase: Okay, so it was a special moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! The 3rd Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts the fall of his father & emperor 3) The destruction of the second death star (Lando's Moment) <br /> <br /> -The final party with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of cool because of Ewoks but I think it's a little cold that while the whole galaxy celebrates the EMPIRE fall, our heroes have their own private party in the woods with each other. All in all, it was a fine final chapter for our heroes and an appropriate end to the STAR WARS story.
