'The Second Beginning', as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end of humanity. Long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by Wachowskis shows us the world that could lie within us in the not-distant world until the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance divided into problems common to human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second Renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple man against the layout of the machine, this story explains the struggle the machines have put on, the struggle for acceptance in a world controlled by humans. Where the matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second renaissance part 1 + 2 is similar to many issues raised by the original Matrix movie, such as how the war broke out, how the sky was blackend, what led to the use of humans as batteries, and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01, which may be relevant to the upcoming Matrix Revolution movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away too much of the story as I don't want to ruin the experience for the prospects, however, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the matrix world or just anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime ). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
