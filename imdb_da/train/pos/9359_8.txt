The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. When he played a very steep and fragile character, he took his ability to the edge and really worked the role. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part that Sandler did to me. For someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he drew a serious role with what appeared to be his own quirks and inputs. I especially loved the scene where Adam and Don's characters saved the motorized scooter around the city. I was familiar with the moment because it seemed that Don was witnessing a thing that Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, his scooter with his headphones ran like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the watch.
