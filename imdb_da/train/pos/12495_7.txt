What's Good About It: Some inventive and truly scary little effects that come under the skin of even the most spicy horror fan. Don't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack staffs for their "gotcha" moments. Although you've seen everything, there are still a few things in this movie that will get your jaw droplet. What could have been better about it: The action was sometimes flat and unconvincing. It had a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (although it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was looking for) and the camera's work is full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless actions. Although the effects are really unsafe, I think they might have gone to the well a few times too many times with some of them. The ending seemed rushed and shone over what could have been more effective moments. The viewer is left to find out a lot of things for himself, not as a challenge from the filmmakers, but because they just missed it. <br /> <br /> Still a good little indie horror movie that is easily multiple steps above average. Worth renting.
