SPOILER ALERT! This movie, Zero Day, gives an interior to the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel reluctance and hatred for someone and something associated with school there. <br /> <br /> They go on a series of self-thought out "missions" that all lead to the big mission, which is zero day. Zero Days Content is not set until the middle to the end of the movie. The seer knows his serious and full of hatred, but is never quite until the end. Now we all know if the film is based on Columbine Massacre, the end is quite obvious. And the end is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their fellow students at the end. I've seen many movies on this attack, and this movie of Long is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and insight into the lives of these two teens who hate life, and honestly it gives the viewer a part of an understanding and a closure of the horrible event. Only 7 when the events played out, I never knew the seriousness of the play until my English class was assigned an essay or story at a particular time in our generation. Now I knew that everyone should choose Twin Towers, but I would be different because the two towers were tragic and very defining, but I didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relationship for that Because I was only in 3rd grade, and I had no idea what it all meant. But the shooters gave way and effect. I remember the interviews, the school's heavenly views and the damage and the terror of thousands of people. This film is a judgmental, down to earth and a scary masterpiece, and I would reccomened it to anyone.
