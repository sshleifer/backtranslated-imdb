A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse as he becomes involved in a fatal fatality in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates an exciting, Gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Sporting a southern drawl, Branagh is convincing as a lawyer, and Davidtz is prolonged as the object of his desire. Downey is like a private detective. Duvall has a small role that does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting set-up, the film is bog and does not really deliver on its original promise, but Altman is always worth a visit.
