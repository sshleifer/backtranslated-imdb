The actors in this fine movie did a great job of getting you involved in the characters as they suffered during this terrible trial. The horrible scene in the forest was made so beautiful that you forgot that these men were only actors and played parts. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on display, as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and even though he first came short, James Dickey, the man who authored the book on which the movie is based, as sheriff to Aintry. It is somewhat disturbing and children should, of course, be foreclosed from it, but it is a wonderfully dramatic cinema.
