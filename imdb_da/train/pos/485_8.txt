'Luzhin Defense' is a good movie with fine central performances, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmakers' craftsmanship shines through. It felt through most of the film that the characters just helped push the story together. Marlene Gorris might have investigated Luzhin's psyche, rather than portraying him as a tortured innocent victim torn by other cruel motives. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This movie does not go deep enough into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's rip with her mother comes across an eerie disagreement of the mother rather than a dramatic flash point in the movie. I felt that I was put through Luzhin's plague and any tragic end without having the pleasure of wiping out his unusual and complex personality. But this was a moving and fun movie, but certainly not a big one.
