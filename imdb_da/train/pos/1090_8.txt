One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Mixs Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it, the home would be a dream home today. Still, Cary did a good job in the ad group, even though he had a devil of some time trying to make a slogan for the Wham brand ham. What made this movie so popular was housing shortage in the post-war World War II era. Recurring war veterans claimed their rights under the GI Bill of Rights, which included mortgages. The problem was there were literally not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Around time, the book by Eric Hodgins and the film was so popular that Congress passed, and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Law, which put the government for the first time in housing construction. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt who were at the same time building their own home as they moved into the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and sought to get out of the city of Rochester. Their place was not quite as big as a Connecticut house with eighteen rooms, but they lived there for the rest of their lives as Cary and Myrna probably did. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and the cost just kept adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaning assistants. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer advice, usually too late. The truth is told that he is sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles moves to the country and William Powell has headache Cary Grant, the movie will still work fine. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mixing's Builds His Dream House still works well as a comedy, because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream home for over 40 years.
