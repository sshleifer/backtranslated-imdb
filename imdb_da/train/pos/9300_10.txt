I don't know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed too self-confident full of myself. So when I call this one of my all-time faves, it's nothing to do with a tribute band mentality. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not realism. It is kafkaesque (a shame, Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was as good as Joseph K), it is stylish, familiar, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum navigates around a wide range of characters, trying not to be shot and acting fuller rather than dorkily, trying to keep abreast of what he knows and others don't do who he can push out and who he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and the supportive throw looks spot-on. The symbolism, the settings (one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum going down the stairs, seems really strange after so much foliage), the dialogue (style, not practical, is the order of the day), it's about characters that interact, not real gangsterism . Fun to see must have been fun to do. What the critics were about is really a mystery ...
