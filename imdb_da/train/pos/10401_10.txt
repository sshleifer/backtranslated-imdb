Words can hardly describe it, so I will be short. "The Baghdad's Thief" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to amaze or enchant me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it when I was a boy of six who started reading "The Arabian Nights." I remember going into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's fight with the giant spiders and immediately spoiled. <br /> <br /> Rarely has so much beauty, magic and wonder been taken on film. Sabu and John Justin are amazing as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is extremely nice as the evil villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to see as the Sardinian genius. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has rightly been hired by the critics, but is often overlooked by the audience for his remarkable films, including "A Case of Life and Death" (also "Stair to Heaven") and "The Red Shoes." He's one of the true gentlemen in the camera right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all the great works of art, the beauty of Baghdad's Thief is in the details. Each frame has its own magic charm. The story never does, and the characters and their actions are always involved. Here is a movie that never gets old.
