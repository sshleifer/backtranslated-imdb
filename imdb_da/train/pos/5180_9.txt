There is this private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site starting in 1965, and my two brothers have places there now. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with the movie; carry with me.) I spent summers on Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old when I was eighteen and it is for people like me to whom this movie speaks: those for whom a group camp in the forest was as my fiancé tells about me, "the good and happy place". If you have never experienced the lifestyle, the Indian summer will probably be lost on you; do not want to. It is not fast, it does not have quick cuts, the plots are not at least coincidental, it has no explosions, such dramatic excitement exists, is mild, there are no A-list actors, there is no quick fire just for to show how clever scriptwriters are (except perhaps Kimberley Williams' killed on how her fiancé should not "overcome her toys." It is not least what this film is about, more than The Godfather is a slasher girl just because it has a lot on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is Godfather's polar opposite. If you have experienced the lifestyle then watch this movie read more just do it. <br /> <br /> For me this is a 9/10 movie.
