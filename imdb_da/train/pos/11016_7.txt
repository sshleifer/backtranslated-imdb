Good action show, but nothing new. This took place high in the mountains, which showed some beautiful scenes and such. A man takes a group of mercenaries, the leader flies, and he kicks ass. It could have been called "Rambo goes to the Rockies", it was pat. It had a very effective scene right at the first of the movie that made me cry in horror. Not a bad picture, but just the same ol ', same ol'.
