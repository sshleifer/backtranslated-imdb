"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of the above compares to the complexity of "The Sopranos". Each character has layers of layers of absolute verity, completely and completely three-dimensional. We care about Tony Sopran wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good against evil he is evil. Soprano is the most provocative, intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created for this point in history. If you are in the mood to be openly challenged as a viewer, and to always be changed to your feelings of entertainment, see "The Sopranos". I defy anyone to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1 and will not continue with the series. Every season is absolutely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential for any collection **** 4
