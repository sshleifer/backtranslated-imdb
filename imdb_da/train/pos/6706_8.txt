I remember this show as it became a regular show on a Saturday night. Sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts, as witches are, and she is one more. So Sabrina must learn to control her powers and use them effectively. She also has to deal with school a vicious rival named Libby, her ditsy best friend and girlfriend Harvey Kinkle ... The show was fun and entertaining. It was held Saturday nights entertaining for a 10 year old boy .. and made him laugh loudly ... And flirting with 'Libby' ....
