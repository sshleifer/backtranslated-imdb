You know? Our spirit is based on the revolution it sleeps ... I can explain I believe !! Well ... Until that happened on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we got it by the revolution, it seems that Portuguese people lost their mind, we do not use our freedom of speech! It is all a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think it has some flaws on some character's actions, but mostly I use to watch Portuguese movies it is pretty good !! I really like it!
