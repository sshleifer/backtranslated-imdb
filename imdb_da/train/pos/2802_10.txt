As someone who has never been in sports, it seems that it would be difficult for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, football) -template "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say it was a cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I want to say British - and internationally) and just love football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (her mother offers a really shattered description of football early in the film). Okay, so maybe it was kind of clich√© in that sense, but you must love this movie! And if I like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of "bend" in football ... Don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit it big: A few months after "BILB" came out in the states, she stared in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean": The Curse of the Black Pearl ".
