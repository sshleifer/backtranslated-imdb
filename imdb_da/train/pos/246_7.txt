How could I possibly surpass the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I couldn't and then, I rented this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised at what I found out about this kid's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Maybe it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon, or maybe because it was a little slow, I found this story hard to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I float to recommend this as a must see, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, it's very rare and should be appreciated) and the movie has some good actions sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for historical value .... (yes right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
