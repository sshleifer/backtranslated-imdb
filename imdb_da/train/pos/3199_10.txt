OK, I don't really think Trailer Park Boys have bad story lines because they kick ass. They are just ... conflict with each other. For example: At the end of the movie, Ricky and Julian show that "Patrick Lewis" puts the dog down and goes away. So at the end it shows Ricky and Julian that they have been in prison for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian shouting for "Patrick Lewis". But in the television series, they apparently have only been in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> They also give us the impression that the storyline of the film and the TV series storyline are connected (because of the shouting scene between the boys). But some actors portray completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pay Ricky for extinction, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know I have a lot to say), in the movie, guys snot cola instead of smoking hash. The thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway, except for the shouting scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to continue blabbing.
