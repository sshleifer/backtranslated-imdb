I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the parts phenomenally and with good heart. She plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she understands that she is alone. <br /> <br /> One day, when she is alone at home, the stranger enters her home and attacks her again. I'm not about to call the police or get him out, she's forced to spray him in the face and catch him in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the earth. They are too easy on these criminals. It's time for more severe penalties.
