There is some very wise humor in this movie, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. But after a while it just seems like an exercise in style (despite big gags that Balasko continues with Dussolier, and very well acting by everyone involved) and I wondered why Blier made this movie. Everything is revealed at the end when Blier, who leads Claude Brasseur, gets a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional capper and of course obvious. But there is not really enough dramatic excitement or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout his time. However, some great scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacr√©s' in the French cinema, should enjoy this movie.
