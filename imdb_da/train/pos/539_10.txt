The first was good and original. I was a not bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard someone else was made and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this filmwork is Judd Nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. A pretty good script for someone who wrote the Final Destination movies, and the direction was okay. Sometimes there are scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home camera with a grainy look. Great movie for tv. It was well worth the rent and probably worth buying just to get that lovely creepy feeling and see Judd Nelson's Stanley doing what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest new players to see the first before they look at the sequel, just so you will have an idea of ​​what Stanley is like and get a little history background.
