This is a great action movie with great liners from Arnie! It is stylishly made, with lots of tense actions to keep one happy. The characters were amazing, and Richard Dawson is very threatening as the biggest villain. Yes it has lots of plot holes, but it is very extremely entertaining, with a great end too. It also had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. The character development was also quite good, with some fantastic performances. The management is great! Paul Michael Glaser, doing a very good job here with great color tinting, keeps it stylish all the way through, great camera angles and overall to keep the movie at a very fast pace! good work. There is a little gore. We get a pair of bloody shoot wounds, exploding head, slit neck, bloody chain saw discs, skinless corpses, blood and impaling. The working is great!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department, has lots of fun a liners, kicks it ass and is always a great physical presence! And was lots of fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, doing well here, she was really sweet and had good chemistry with Arnie!. Yaphet Kotto is decent here with what to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, is good as the geeky type of guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is great as the biggest villain and was very much threatening and he was fun to see. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they should do very well as stalkers. Overall a must see! **** 1/2 out of 5
