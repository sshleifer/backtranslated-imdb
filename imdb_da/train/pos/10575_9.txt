Fast, fun, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel charms you with her joke and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film of the insinuation in the manuscript, costumes and the way they touch each other. And bikinis before there were bikinis! This is not a locked-in fun for everyone. However, I do not understand the John Garfield problem. Is it no matter if he is in this movie or not? If he is, the screen is so short that he is basically a plug. You have to see the frame for frame to find him if he is there. I'm a big Cagney fan, but had never seen it before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it by a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy the trip!
