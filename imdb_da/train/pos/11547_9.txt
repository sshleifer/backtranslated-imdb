and laugh a lot of fun in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the film is well-synchronized, a story of contradictions trying to find a way to survive each other closely. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly Lemmon and Matheau's best film as co-stars, and the interplay between the sloppy Oscar and OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene where Oscar lines up a double date leaves the room short and comes back to find Felix, and the two girls all crying are invaluable fun. <br /> <br /> For any fan of intelligent comedies, The Odd Couple is a "go out of your way to watch it" movie.
