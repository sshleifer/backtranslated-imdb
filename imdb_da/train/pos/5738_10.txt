I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer is from last year 2001. This film from 1988 is really a good little movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since. I love the opening of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Make Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that the tour of Pitts on the trash can with Nicky is a very scenic, interesting one! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, gives a remarkable, wonderful achievement. The DVD is a good transfer, with no extra features, but a widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
