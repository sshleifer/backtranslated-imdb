Robert Stack has never really surpassed losing a best supporting actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" for Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life." Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunk blunt who is in love with Mitch. Their story unfolds in a brilliant color under Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some amazing films, including "Imitation of Life", "All That Heaven Allowed", "Magnificent Obsession" and many others. Br /> <br /> Make no mistake - this is a pot boiler and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles. Malone wins a best support role Oscar. There is a fantastic scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances wildly to loud music, while her father collapses and dies on the stairs. We've got to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch doesn't want anything with her. He is so in love with Lucy, that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he would be so eager to get there today, no matter how much he was in. Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who has cleared up Kyle's fairs for his entire seat life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband begins to drink again after a year of seventh. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players. <br /> <br /> In Sirk's hands, "Written on the Wind" is an effective movie, and the big scene towards the end of the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and even though he had many imitators, he never had equal.
