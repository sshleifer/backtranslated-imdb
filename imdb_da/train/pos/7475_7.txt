After reading some pretty negative views for this movie, I wasn't sure if I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if it's better than this, I'd be in heaven. Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David convinces me that he is more than a smile on his legs (for only the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia and born on July 4th). Penelope Cruz is a little lightweight but meets the demands of her role, like Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not the spectacle that really impresses - it is filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role and gives him a welcome change of pace from his usual sktick. The growing insanity of the film is done perfectly by Crowe (the short order in which the cruise goes through an empty square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a characteristic of a Crowe film) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The reason seems to be a little constructed, but the problems explored behind it are infinitely debatable. The movie is not perfect, but it is a welcome change in the pace of Cruise and Crowe, and for those raised on a Hollywood luster diet it should be a revelation.
