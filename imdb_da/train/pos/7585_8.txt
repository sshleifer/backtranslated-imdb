This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as "intellectual horror" cinema, this movie is it. I started to be scared and wished there was someone else looking at it with me and it hardly has a plot! I have to watch this movie again several times before I feel I really understand it. If you are the kind of person who likes "My Dinner With Others" and movies of Godard, or if you make many interchangeable drugs, you will probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
