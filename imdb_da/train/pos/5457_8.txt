This movie is one of the more risqu√© black and white films of this time in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Code was enforced. It's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of the business using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who really do a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and gets her up on the business by sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck makes an excellent performance as a strong woman who uses men as one-time offers, hardly any feelings for those who play them as if they were peasants. Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love in her thoughts, just power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie should be a little different from other movies I've seen because there is hardly any background music heard. I think this is only because this is when people were first introduced to live the sound and dialogue between the people in the film. The few times the music is heard is in the beginning, as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain. The movie and various scenes were amazing! The director of this movie made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was all a good movie. The end of this movie was not as good as it should have been, but it didn't completely ruin it. Baby Face had its slowly moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps some predictable parts like who she wants to sleep with next. But this is a lovable movie that can be seen more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
