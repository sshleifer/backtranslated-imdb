All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated children's movie like no other. Games, drinks, death, weapons and hell are all prominent in the plot, and even though the children get very little of it, adults will scramble why this movie was made to feel like a gangster movie. The actual movie isn't explicit in any way, it's just a weird combination to make a child's movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns a half casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After drinking (A dog .... gets full in a child's movie. It sounds just odd.) Charlie is being fooled and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and plans payback on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan girl Anne Marie caught because of her amazing ability to talk to all animal species, helping to predict breeds. Charlie and Itchy release her and try to help her find a family while they learn a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both children and adults. The kids will enjoy the fun characters and lively animations, while adults will enjoy the cozy, sweet plot and the more than normally developed characters. One thing that keeps it down is that it is a musical. It's usually a good thing, but the music here is frankly horrible. They tend to jump around, almost sounding ad libbed, alongside no instrumental support. In fact, it's probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart because of some bad notes. The end of this movie works but I honestly honor it. It's sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. Given how poor the successor to this was, I would wish that the end would not have justified a successor and it would have packed into a good, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel this way about, but I do. All in all, it is a lovely family movie, with odd themes thrown in, but nevertheless good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 85 minutes. G.
