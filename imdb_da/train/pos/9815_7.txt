Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released later this year) is worth a look. The Niro role is not great, yet entertaining as one of two friends who are first trying to prevent another friendship, later chasing him down to force him into it. Any die hard De Niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by the best actor today.
