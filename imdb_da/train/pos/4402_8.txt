After seeing all of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. in the 50's, it's a thrill to watch this movie with a new perspective of director Ang Lee. The space for the attack by Lawrence, Kansas is amazing. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is excellent as the bad guy. Still, the film makes you feel the fate of the war sky and the desperate situation of the protagonists, who do not know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth a look.
