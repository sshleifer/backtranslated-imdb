I joined IMDb so people know what a great movie is! It is not often you encounter a moving movie and is visually cinematic yet humble. You have read the plot so the only thing I want to say is to look at it because you will see a clash of cultural religious identity because it is the typical misconception people read in, rather than just appreciating and realizing it is about a father and son on a journey grows knowing each other through their battles. Buy it and send it on before movie4 get around to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA to be independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to someone, even if you never see any subtitle or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that keeps you engaged. All I want is that it should be longer and see what happens
