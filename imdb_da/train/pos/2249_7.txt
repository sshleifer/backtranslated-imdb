I enjoyed seeing Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true depiction of the LDS belief. I think a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial as many people today are not aware of the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. It's an incredible story of a strong and affectionate people. As a member of the Church, the most threatening aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not disturb me much) was the depiction of Brigham Young as one who had "deliberately deceived" church members to believe he had been called to be Joseph's successor as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in that regard are historical fact, since in reality both Brigham and the majority of the church members understood and believed that he had been called to lead the church. . Brigham does not deliberately deceive the Saints; rather, he led them self-assuredly by inspiration. The point is important to the Mormons because it is linked to an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, as Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you believe in this statement just because the movie doesn't exactly show what Brigham himself believed in.
