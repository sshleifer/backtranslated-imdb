Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have at least heard of - it has virtually the same principles as the second and fourth and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still amazing - a fiery duke of Wellington and a fat foolish dr. Johnson (author of the first dictionary in England) reckons this series. There are even more fun, one-liners to be delivered in this series and it brings humor into a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and pleasurable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known party, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a fun and efficient one and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very good! 9.10
