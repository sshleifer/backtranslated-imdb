I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (though all he did was swim) increased my eyes. To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring Lex Luthor down, that's what I've been waiting for. This sounds a little under the topic, but making a live action Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to push everything I normally do during the week down the drain just to see an episode. This is the thrill I got from seeing this episode. I wish they had made this episode a little longer, as a two-hour special, because I felt that an hour in the Justice League was not enough. Now before I live (unless I already have my walk), I just want to say Smallville is tough again. It kind of lost its touch when the show started focusing on Lana. But I'm sure the authors will just fall back into that loophole. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good comes out. Catch it again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first aeration.
