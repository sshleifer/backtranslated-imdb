I saw this movie so many times through my childrens cover that I can see all the dialogues as much again until today. And when I see it now, it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laughing. I think it's great how they managed to train animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they are able to play the lead role in a feature film. But see it now, I can unfortunately also notice that it is not the masterpiece I once thought it was. But I prefer to remember how I felt about it when I was younger and looked at VHS on my fist TV that would shoot the picture in yellow. And and considering it's a children's movie, I still want to give it 10/10.
