Here is one, the whole family will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves old for adventure. Shelley Duvall fought with this unique, imaginative take on almost all of the popular fairy tales of childhood. The scripts offer new twists on the old gamber we grew up and they have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard, and it is, in my opinion, one of the five best series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her from "Flashdance" - and she is still in Hollywood today making a movie here and there) in the title role, Jean Stapleton as a fairy godmother with a southern accent and Eva Arden as the performance of the evil diocese. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a hilarious duo like the stepists. Matthew Broderick is a gracious prince Henry. You will all come back for this!
