A good movie and I will see a number of times. Rig (the previous commentary) is right: there is much more going on here than it is clear from the title boards, and I have to wonder how much there is a little in the translation. Was there more in the original? Or is a mother tongue expected to read more? Or - since the manuscript was written by the author of the novel on which this was based - was this a popular story, where the audience was already well known? In short, it is very worth seeing, but it probably requires more work from today's viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it. <br /> <br /> The Alpha Video release releases the new organ score, but the music hasn't matched the story progression in any way. Sure, it starts promising, but degenerates into a repeating, Phillip-glass-like monotony that doesn't reflect any of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and simply saw: much better!
