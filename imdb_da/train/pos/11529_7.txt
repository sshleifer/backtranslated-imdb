As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed infamous societies differed from Mrs Leslie Carter into an international stage star), it is certainly not in a league with the other Warner's biopic of similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is?), but "Lady" is an enjoyable movie in itself - and shares quite a few in common with the Cagney Classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" is brimming with old-time show-business tastes. (Among other things, both films have delicious theatrical boarding sequences as well as the inevitable scenes in backstage and in theatrical management agencies.) Also in "Lady" as in Cohan biopic, the support casting is composed of well-known and beloved character actors during the period, all making this kind of top-notch work we remember them for. <br /> <br /> Should I add it, again as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" doesn't allow the truth to get in the way of telling a good story? But, also as "Dandy", "Lady" manages - gloriously! - to convey the essence of his show-business giant that is greater than life. Everyone knows that Cagney always glued Cohan in his brilliant and loving portrayal of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few filmmakers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair" - and did so with a panache that is almost similar to Cagney's. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures the legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its exaggerated glory. Rains gives an extremely entertaining, excellently observed and remarkably true to life's performance as the man all Broadway once called "The Wizard." Seeing Claude Rains in action (looking in every shot as if he has a helluva good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair" is to watch David Belasco jump to life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up on the main trunk again. <br /> <br />
