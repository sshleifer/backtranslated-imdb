I really enjoyed this movie. It took a rather dark story, namely Shakespeare's Macbeth, and wrapped it in a quirky, often fun and exciting modern yarn. <br /> <br /> The way the filmmaker brought together the completely different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth Scotland under a roof. The opposite worlds are really <br /> <br /> really spreading the game's intrigue and comedy, and you must love Harold Perrineau as the choir, a part that doesn't exist in the play, but really helps jazz up. The end stands out among the small indies I have seen for its closure and originality.
