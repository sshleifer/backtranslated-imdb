I don't know what the previous reviewer looked like, but I guess that's what the reviews are, personal taste. Missing in this movie was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotions that affect. Undercurrents of restrained love due to submission to societal beliefs, taboos of times and classes, racial relationships that are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark emotional, To submit to it, a floating film, not slow as mentioned before, free yourself to the film's flow, the emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their mistakes, their ugly interior, excellent and indeed very cruel!
