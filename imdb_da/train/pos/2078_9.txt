This adaptation of Pearl S. Bucks movie is definitely a classic. A real Hollywood epic, it has all the things a great Hollywood movie has: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair and so on. There is only one thing that annoys me. I know it was a sign of time, but none of the two main characters played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She doesn't even look Chinese! I think she was trying to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they didn't, and Mrs Rainier is very good at the movie, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". Stillm it's a good movie, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). It's a must see, just look over the casting. I think you can.
