In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin and today an alcoholic decadent man John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is employed by industry Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) to be the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the cold Creasy's behavior, makes him live and smile again, and he feels great devotion to her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill any one responsible for the abduction. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will surely become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny, and although it has 146 minutes of driving time, the viewer does not feel the time past. Cast is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, focusing on Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinematography has amazing moments, and the manuscript has amazing lines. I personally loved when Christopher Walkens character explains Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is dead and he prepares his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best if not the best movie of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
