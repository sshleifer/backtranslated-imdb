Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (even a remake of the 1941 movie, here comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new (albeit temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a back-up reserve for the then Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our main character is a struggling young - and certainly low talent standup comedian. <br /> <br /> Seeing the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian is very fun. It's a bit like watching Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries his material, he is lustily bent - so much so that his nickname becomes "Booie." His jokes are lame, his delivery is painful. In short, Lance is all that the real Chris Rock is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger and he is driving on the road to try even more material when BAM! He is hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he was taken off his body one tenth of a second early by a little incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he would be hit anyway. No dice, it seems that Lance is not due in heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), "the leader" of heaven reluctantly accepts to find a new body for it did not completely die Mr Barton. The problem is that the body they find is of a greedy, old white man. Showing this trap (a Mr. Wellington) owns every possible thing - he's the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. <br /> <br /> But of course, in the wealthy Mr. Wellington's body falls to Lance for a beautiful hospital worker (Regina King). We men know how hard it is to find a woman who gets our own body, but try to win one while you are a dumpy old old guy! And it's even worse when she's not impressed with your money. <br /> <br /> This is Rock's first shot on a leading role, and in my opinion, he performs admirably. There is still a lot of the standup comedian in him - and of course if he ever wants to get different roles, he may have to stop incorporating setup routines into the script - but that's not really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his driving, his delivery, his behavior and his passion - is what fuels this movie. He obviously has a lot of fun in his role and he seems to be bent on making sure he has fun watching him.
