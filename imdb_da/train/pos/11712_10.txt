It's such a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to get into the public eye and tell his story is an inspiration to those suffering from this disease. I have great respect for her as a person. The only thing I don't like is that I can't get it on tape, I've tried to look for it, but without success. Anyone know how to get it?
