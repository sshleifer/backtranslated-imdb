hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire and I love to see Melissa Joan Hart at t.v which I think she's fine. I'm a real fan of sabrina teenage witch so it helped my look at it (don't ask). I love the way Nicole is planning to explore her parents murder very carefully as she makes sure someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles so she won't give away fingerprints (a very well planned out idea), back I guess it all backfired on nicole as she was caught as her old boyfriend comes together and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie a nine out of ten and put it in my top 10 movie list. And last but not least if anyone sees this movie in the shops, tell me as I watched it on TV and not recorded it. Goodbye
