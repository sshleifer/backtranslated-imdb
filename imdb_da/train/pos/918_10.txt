If anyone is interested in getting a copy of this movie, please read the bottom of this description: First television from CBS on November 30, 2003, for TV program that finds John Christmas, a successor to the previous one year's A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk reprising his role as the versatile host's angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a signposted small town nurse whose depression ... over the fact that the hospital IS she maintains, may be forced to shut down due to a $ 100,000 debt being lifted shortly when she sees a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noah's firefighter Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank will quietly return to the city without explanation or fanfare, but it turns out impossible when Noah's newspaper sends a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there is something, very, very curious about the image: It also shows a Christmas man's cloth that seems to flow in midair without a resident. The elusive "Santa" is, of course, the English Max, who over and over in the history of a variety of situations to solve problems, dispense advice, untie plots - and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana ). <br /> <br /> Interested in getting a copy: Write to me here: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
