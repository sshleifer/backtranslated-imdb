I just finished watching "California" at Showtime in the fourth time since I first saw it back in July 2001. You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer movies, "California" would be among some of the previous movies worth mentioning. , but don't. Perhaps, if this film had been released once in a period of 1996-1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" is very different from most serial killer movies released in the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer movies such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown a killer, but that person is always behind a mask, or we never see enough of them to actually learn about them. "California" is a film that actually tries to break through the barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. It tries to answer questions like "why do they do the things they do?" Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or strong? Or do they do it because they like the excitement of the killings? "These are some of the things that" California "are trying to answer, but they also give us space to try to find things for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression as Early Grayce. the start of the movie, we see that of course he is a disturbed person.When we first see him, it is late at night, early may be full, we see him then pick up a stone, throw it off a bridge, And it lands later on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is tough in this movie, it is always good to see him playing psychosis or really bad people, it is funny that this will later lead him to play a real lone as in "12 Monkeys" and that he would be at the other end of the spectrum of David Fincher's "Seven".
