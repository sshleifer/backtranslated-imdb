I didn't expect much from this movie. I got a ticket for an advanced screening. I just got away from work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed to be no cool air flowing through the halls of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I didn't recognize any of the actors at first, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the start, I was consumed with the movie and became more and more enthusiastic with every minute of passers-by. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy / adventure classic. The actors were amazing, the pace was perfect and the end was magical.
