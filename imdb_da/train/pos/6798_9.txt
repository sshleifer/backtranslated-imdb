(No spoilers, just plot details) I can't understand such hate for this episode. Want to see a bad episode of Smallville? See underground - now there is a bag Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say so often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The alternative universe scenario seems annoyingly realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared in "Static", returns and tells Clark that the doctor who heads the insane asylum where they are held is actually a phantom from the phantom area and if Clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him. An overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace.
