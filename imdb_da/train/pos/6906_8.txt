I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, sweet, silly and entertaining. Had a nice cast and was really hammered by some critics for reasons that I really don't understand. No, it was not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable movie. Julia was great at playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'. The story is a little silly to be sure, but it's not a loud drama, folks. I happened to see a review of the movie, probably the only good it got and then ran into it one night when I was looking for a movie. I never heard it stink before I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually, the VHS tape bought at the bargain deck, and I see it a couple of times a year.
