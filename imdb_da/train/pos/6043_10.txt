I've seen the freebird movie and think it's amazing! it was fun if the British film industry came in time with something entertaining !! It is good how the guy who met them at the service station is mentioned in the movie in the news agents, nice touch. The action was convincing (I'm a biker) they reminded me of some good times I've had on the bike scene. It was good to see the film director coming in on the play, well done jon! In the end, a new crop is seen, in Ireland is this the basis of a second film? hope so keep them coming. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
