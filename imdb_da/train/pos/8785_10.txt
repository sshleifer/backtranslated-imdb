Some say whether 'The Play is the most important thing', or something of it, attributed to the old Bard of Avon, even William Shakewspeare. If it wasn't old it might be our own super-veteran movie director, Mr Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. No one is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also presents another prize called Errol Flynn's favorite of his own major role cars. It makes clear on screen evidence that easily leads viewers sitting in the dark theater or watching it on their home TV or DVD to conclude the same. <br /> <br /> For sure, history is a semi-serious Biopic that takes part of the factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the ancient imagination to give us a very satisfying, though somewhat fictionalized (what Biopic is not?) Instances. <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent as it makes good use of our leader's natural athleticism, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although it is not a Swashbuckler, a Western or a war image, this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the primary role that was the best fit for the rugged Australian. Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in either 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in the 'sweet science' are evident throughout the film and especially in "Big Fight" for the world's gravity championships with the great John L.Sullivan himself. by Ward Bond) The cast sounds like a duty robber of Warner Brothers resident supporting players. It has Alan Hale as Jim Corbets father, a Livery Wagon operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two 'blue collar' men in the family, their profession being listed as 'Longshorm'. The great Jack Carson makes his usual masterful serio-comic performance in support as Jim Corbett's friend and fellow bank counter. The rest of those we can both recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Less Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn just to name a few. <br/> <br /> Director Walsh has also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in roles of various Boxers. Therefore, we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis, and an unknown Grappler * is characterized as the 2 port fronts in the opening scene. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (ever hear about him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a strong but unpolished look about those that the old Pier 9 brawlers would have had. <br /> <br /> We haven't forgotten Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. She is strong in her characterization of an "independent" woman, yet she probably maintains true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes. She shows a great range in her part as a poor little rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix the items in appropriate proportions to give it the right mix. Well, Director Walsh does it with a ruthless task. Because he's looking for, above all, a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he had honed for a fine tuning starting with his days playing with D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special love for the period of the 1890s. *** Mr. Walsh's direction moves through the manuscript on a fairly fast cut and breaks the exhibition scenes with a humorous battle line "Corbetts is aware of it!" Therefore, he is able to maintain a light, even humorous touch to a story that could be too boring and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, Brother Walsh in an almost unnoticed feature gives us an authentic look of a San Francisco of the 1890s. And as a further example of his love for that period, he creates wide, dynamic images of the historical prize battles. There is a vibrant, joyful mood performed in these boxing scenes. As a war love for this great, perhaps underrated, movie, Director Walsh gave the picture a look as if it were an illustration from The Police Gazette covering such events in the "old days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to remember before you see it. If it is for the first time or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "CORBETS ARE ON IT AGAIN !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion, as a historian of both film and pro wrestling, it resembles Tor Johnson, who years later was a favorite with CEO Ed Woods. <br /> <br /> ** A 'Livery' is a somewhat archaic expression of a vehicle for rent for local city transport. <br /> <br /> *** That's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith Veteran Player. He was the actor to portray John Wilkes Booth in a nation's birth (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and of the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Bout and what it meant for sporting life in America these days.
