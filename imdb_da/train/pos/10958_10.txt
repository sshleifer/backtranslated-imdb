This show is so much fun that I couldn't stop watching the Marathon at Comedy Central tonight (despite having seen all episodes before). I have always considered Silverman as a great talent, and it is finally a means of the talent that enjoys a wide audience. I see this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can't say about many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) fun! This is a show I will never miss, and this is one I want to buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to see this show ... I predict a long run for this series ... And just to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just don't get ... maybe missing they intelligence to understand it ... they should stop fooling themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in connection with Silverman, or who claims that she only intends to "shock" ... is far away from the mark ... She is exactly the opposite; Just Google her and you will soon see that she is a great advocate of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that she ironically covers all these outrageous views, you will not. And if you don't, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
