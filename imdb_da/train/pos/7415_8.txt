How powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be. This film tells that it is narrative with everyday scenes that manages to regain the poignancy hidden inside. It is true, as others have said, how this movie really makes it clear how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, overloaded emotion and over the top climate change and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism . So much of what these characters go through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in verbal dialogue. One aspect I really enjoyed the movie was the contrast of the two brothers, such a very open-minded expression in his childish manner and the other quite stoic, but both could bring deep feelings. The older brother had to say a little, as he used to do, it was all there in his death-face! Beautiful movie, wonderful play, good direction! Don't miss out!
