The world consists of two different kinds of movie goods ... There are "English Patient" types that cannot be disturbed by enjoying something that is not enough to appear on PBS and there are "Happy Gilmore" types, for who's an hour and a half of genitalia puns is definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a ton of gray area but you know which side you lean. If you are an English patient, save time, save your money and save us all your "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments. I know you enjoy watching any movie you don't like, and any person who likes them, but maybe you could keep it off this time. <br /> <br /> But if you're a Happy Gilmore type. .. see this one ... You find it fun. Tim Meadows has created a fun character, and Will Farrell continues to be fun in almost everything he does. Go check it out. You will be glad you did. And that's okay.
