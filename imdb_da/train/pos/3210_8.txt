The SOLDER is not as bad as many have made it to be. I found the film to have some of the sacred, cynical humor in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and the top action is conscious and adds to the comic-book atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A particular trivia bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space warfare tattoos on his chest and one of those battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the ignorant people out there, the Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Baty's elegant last lines of Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought with android troops like Roy is insane to say the least. Perhaps scriptwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this one 3 out of 5.
