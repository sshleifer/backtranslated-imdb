Sure, this movie is juicy and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's entertaining and that's what I watch movies on. To be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is great, even with the short hair. Her smile is brilliant and her beauty cannot be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love him. The two seemed to be really like eacb others in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were funny to see, although d'Abo's British accent crept into her supposed Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I didn't really notice it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with one exception . <br /> <br /> It is a story of two great people who marry significant others, but whoever finds their soulmates in each other. It may be an unlikely story, but who says film should all play as a documentary? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube. Therefore, we see them, to escape from the daily life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job on it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who easily tears up. Don't make me wrong, but it must be a sentimental scene and this movie had lots of them. I only give it 9/10 because I save my 10/10 for the yet invisible super grand movie I know will come someday. If you see it advertised as coming up on Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note to see it. I think you would like it.
