Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are the "Three Smart Girls" in this Universal 1936 movie that introduces Deanna Durbin to the film audience. It also includes Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It is a sweet story of three young women now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother who hears their father (Winninger) getting married again. Having not seen him in 10 years and knowing that their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America with the help of the housekeeper / nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold digger helped and supported by his mother (Brady), makes sure she is introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is full-time (Auer), but the girls fail him for a really wealthy number (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie that's not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some fine performances, especially of Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are beautiful and everyone does good work. The emphasis is of course on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a young youth is much more than it would be as an adult - she has no problems with the high notes that she later did because she put too much weight in the middle. She sings a lovely "Il Bacio" in a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is watching the dad, played by Charles Winninger, not wanting his kids around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as a gold digger is not that young, but the girl's mother looks up there, so it was probably the older man who sought her youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he sought from his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the big star build here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this time still paid his fees and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans, how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and of course this led to a successor and great stardom for Deanna.
