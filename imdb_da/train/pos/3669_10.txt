This film captures the absurd essence of an indulgent American patriotic actor - one who believes his work (and politics) is so crucial to the American people as the statements of the president himself. Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes, and I will remember Bates unnoticed as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of cinema, which can take the audience through the magic of making a movie and revealing how easy it is for the manufacturer and director to lose complete control of the actors' will and countless outside forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject as it portrays: Peter O'Brian leads with precision and complete control and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes' part of the movie and film-in-the-film, " Fly to Bogota "with clarity and insight. If you are at all interested in Canadian cinema's wit and strength, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
