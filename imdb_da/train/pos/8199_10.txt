After what was considered the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer (1976) to be the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirty and gritty than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has previously killed a psychopath killer, vigilante police and Vietnam veteran terrorists. But now he is looking for a new killer, a killer who wants to be repaid by swallowing his attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is on a new murder case, circling back to a woman (played by Sondra Locke) who was brutally raped with her sister, who is traumatized. Ten years later, she is out of revenge by gunning down her attackers. Similarly, because of problems with his superiors, Callahan is after provoking a bully for a heart attack, of which the mob is also chasing him. So to let the heat fall into the city, Harry is on his way to taking a vacation in a seaside resort, but at the same time it is raped in the city while she is chasing her attackers one by one. Harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar when he lives on the killer's paths. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Sudden Impact should be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best Dirty Harry movie yet, much better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool combined. Suddenly Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So are you lucky, punk?
