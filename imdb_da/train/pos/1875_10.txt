A great movie of high quality. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on true events, which, as I said, have the clear ring of truth about it, this movie is very emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often becomes wild in adulthood, as one of life's failures, be it a gangster, drug addict or burden on society. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the fleet is troubled. He is on the brink of being a loser. He is advised in the therapy of a psychiatrist, and that is the relationship that takes the central stage of the play. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks and therapies, the source and remedies of Antone's anxiety are revealed. <br /> Excellent performances from the entire cast. The story is in fact a family drama with emotional and physical agony. All actors provide full blooded beliefs with conviction and realism. A message from the movie is the importance of educating children properly. The real Antwone deserves success. Having shown evil as a child, but rising above it, shows a magnificent character. <br /> <br /> And to all those out there who have endured such torment but survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10
