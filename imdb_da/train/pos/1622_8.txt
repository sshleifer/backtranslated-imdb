I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (whatever ) Louis Armstrong and the Corps are out of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... stereotypes are there, but that was the way it was ... and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main function. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising drawings tend to be more "cutesy" and more upscale, (after all ... we're talking about MGM) than the standard animated card finished over at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or Low Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had lots of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleared him up just before he went "Technicolor". <br /> <br /> Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers too ... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these movies are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now ... clips from Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be reviewed, analyzed ... and even destroyed by future viewers.
