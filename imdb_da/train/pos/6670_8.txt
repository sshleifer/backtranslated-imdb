There are many problems with Mystery Men. First and foremost, there are too many different signs that everyone gets complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects degrade the story and are not so special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic youth role as a character who just cheats and speaks in an inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now on the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shovel are pitch perfect. The sphinx is an exceptionally fun character, which is only mysterious and excludes only the traditional mystical sayings. Ben Stiller is also very entertaining and shows a weak character who tries to make it the superheroes' big leagues. All the characters do, and it's an area that I found extremely ironic. That's because all actors are indie film actors trying to turn it into Hollywood's big leagues. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the cashier's office is that America doesn't do it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the movie, but I feel it would work better if more emphasis was placed on customizing the script than having unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
