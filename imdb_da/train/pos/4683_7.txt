(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their neck in sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I don't know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he is the budding author, his filmography suggests "Love in Time for Money" is a "good start". A stylish shoot with moody music box style music, this flick looks at a chain of heavy conditions as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ends with people A&B in carousel mode. The film carefully tries out the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with nicely reproduced shadows that begin and end with a street hair and her client. The disadvantage of this movie is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical sludges it received. I looked for "Angels in America" ​​last night and was bored at the end, while this little link of character studies kept me spelled bound. Be careful. I can be the only person who really liked this flick. (B)
