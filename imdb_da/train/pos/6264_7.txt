The team Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary film of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing. The fundamental value of this film today is as a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived under what we in the West knew as "the roaring twenties". A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. Raging river and barefoot crossings are brutally realistic, and the animals that disappear underwater actually die. To ensure that the audience of the time believed in the story, a signed certificate of authenticity was offered at the end. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film. Having said all that, the movie is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the informal viewer looking for a good evening's entertainment. The crew had just enough stock to take the shots they shot, and there are no fancy camera work due to multiple re-recordings. The Western Intertitles weaken the experience, but are actually part of the record as they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to spin their lives on the lives of an indigenous people so they would be appreciated by today's audience. Off-duty entertainment by the desert police becomes a "policeman's bullet." The producers continued to make docu-drama Chang (1927) and the completely commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is used again in the People of the Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into - and highly recommended to them.
