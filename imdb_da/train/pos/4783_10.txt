"The Straight Story" is a really beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight riding his lawnmower across the country to visit his alien dying brother. But that's just the basic synapsies ... this movie is about so much more than that. This was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and it is certainly one that he will be remembered for. He is a stubborn old man, not unlike many of the old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives. It comes down and touches a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
