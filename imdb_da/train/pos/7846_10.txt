I'm usually not too into a particular show (except for OC & Desperate Housewives ... hi, I'm 20!), But no fun, after an episode of Reunion I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can't even say how bummed I was that it was a time slot in conflict with Bush's speech last night because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode that is now flying next Thursday. Again, the conflict was disadvantageous because it is a new show to be built up one after another and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum. <br /> <br /> It's said that TV doesn't always have to be Emmy worth the fun. I don't expect Reunion to take home any prizes, but I expect it will catch my attention throughout the season. Ever see the first episodes of a beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you were ever connected. Character building takes some time. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one episode for each year's idea is wonderful. The only other show I remember doing something similar is 24, with each episode being an hour ... and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day of events! Please give this show a shot. Relax on art form ... it's just TV!
