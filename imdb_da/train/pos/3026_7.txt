Charles Boyer was to be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in the "Confidential Agent", a 1945 movie starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to bring coal to his people to fight for the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has its good and not so good points. It is high on atmosphere and excitement, and it is very entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mediocre, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​suitably pathetic and Seymour incredibly wonderful. The not so good points: Bacall should be English and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is great in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat disappointed. Her acting is also not snuff; she's better in other movies. But she is an amazing looking woman, and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour steals almost the entire movie as a hotel guest studying human nature. It is a great deal, and his performance is perfect, while some of the other players' direction is not so good. This was definitely a case of not small parts, only small players. Seymour was not a little actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing for yourself with its mistakes.
