A message movie, but a pretty good one. Outstanding cast, top to bottom. Interesting in that Bette David's plot line is significant back story! The extremely negative reviews (name casts on manuscripts / dramatists, somehow associate this with extremely negative comments about 'Angles in America', etc.). Oppose that the film is too preaching about Germany in World War II. Gosh, it's just a bit too sophisticated to understand morality for me. Theatrical and filmmaking and acting styles vary over time, and of course 70 years later, this film will not be made in this way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but even though it was made the same year and both have Nazis in them, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The love story in this movie takes another seat to the spy plot - more of a thriller. Both have quite a large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character players. The kids are a bit boring and could have been edited
