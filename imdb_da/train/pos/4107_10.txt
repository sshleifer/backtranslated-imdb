I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely fun, morbid, witty ... It makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie, because then I will give out the result! You must see it without knowing what it is about! Everything is connected and has its why & because. It begins subtly, and then things start to run faster and faster until they culminate in the most crazy outburst you can imagine! It is even fun to watch the movie the second time when you know all the tricks. The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
