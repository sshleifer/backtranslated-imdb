Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of doubt, one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in animation. While the first part (Actions 1 and 2) mainly consists of action and fun, the other part is more serious, and one should not treat the other part in the same way as the first part. The features are really out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. You need an extra level of intelligence to appreciate the second part (Acts 3 and 4). However, I have some complaints. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte literally jumps over a tank shell, and it has no sense at all. One can also ask the question of Bonaparte's probability of jumping on the helicopter's wing, even though it was cool. Buaku rules.
