I had seen so much of the series that I was able to watch on TV, but unfortunately a job started that made me work in the evening. I managed to record some of it, at least ... and of course bought the recently released DVD throughout the series. When you look at the DVD, you can see that the animation was a little more raw at first, but they radiated a fairness of the errors when the pilot was finished. The voices are suitable for the characters, and the writing is excellent. It is quite refreshing to see animation coming back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes. It is with the way society has come in the last century that you need to be a little more obvious about it by today's standards to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that are parallel to what we often face in real life. It's your typical sitcom in that respect, but humor is more like what you'd expect from the night television as a talk show shit or Saturday Night Live ... back when SNL was actually fun. Good work, Dreamworks. Maybe you should work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going ... and also improve the marketing of the products for the series to help cover the high costs. It is a challenge to make this a cartoon of a mature nature itself. Hmm ...
