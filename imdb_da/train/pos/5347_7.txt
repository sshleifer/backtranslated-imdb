Another Spanish film about the 1936 Civil War. This time we are told about Carol's story (lovely game by Débutant Clara Lago), a little girl who will live to a small Spanish village from New York. It is such an initial tour, and soon she finds out about the injustice of humanity, their stupid struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photograph and a nice script. He does not try to participate in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide which band we are in) and he takes a great advantage of the presence and freshness of The young starring: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-groomed production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
