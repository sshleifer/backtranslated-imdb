envy is not as fun as I thought it would originally be, but after some of the reviews I read, I found it much more fun than people who gave it props, now it is not true, it is not a gag minute movie as zoolander or dodgeball, but legs make and jack black work well with each other, and christopher walken is as big as ever, so the story is about jack black's character who discovers a spray that makes the dog pooh disappear, i want Don't have any part of it, but when the product makes Jack Black Rich Ben sets start to see the envy, it's not good in every way, and both legs and jack black have more fun and better movies under their belt, but if your fan is, I recommend it as it is still a fun flick and I laughed my ass quite a few times, as a big fan of legs ask id must say this is a lesser quieter but still fun, give it a watch
