I've seen The Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are certainly good, but there's something terribly sweet about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this flick. Jean Arthur shines when she looks at Powell. There is an unmistakable undercurrent between them. This movie may not have the thin man series, but it makes it impossible for it in charm. As I saw it, I probably thought that Powell was about to go outside with Arthur. My friends thought the same thing. This is a movie where I could wish I could step back in time (skimming and locking lips with Powell!) There seems to be no end to his lovable, playful smirks! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man". Okay, it sounds too gushy, but I can't help myself.
