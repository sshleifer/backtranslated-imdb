It's just fun, see it !!! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines, so there: This is a spear on the 50s / 70s werewolf. Lots of satire, some political. Feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less slack. If you like the naked weapon films, you will also like this (once again less slapstick in this one). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor from light varies sexually induendo (inevitably in a teenage comedy) to truly exciting socio-political satire. The transformation of the Moon High School from the 50s to the 70s is really fun. The sequence of the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! Ok maybe not brilliant but still fun. There are tons of (historical) cracks from the early 50's cold war paranoia and 70's inflation. <br /> <br /> On the whole, just watch the movie if you get a chance!
