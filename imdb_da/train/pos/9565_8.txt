Dog Bite Dog is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry? The management is a terrible shot), it can best be described as a fierce drum through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian murder in the city to kill a barrister. Despite being dirty from his journey, he sits almost immediately at a large table in the middle of a naturally expensive restaurant. If this sounds crazy for you, you should avoid this movie. It acted like my cue to suspend disbelief, and I had much more fun for it. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, edgy policeman who likes to turn people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai runs a fine line that has internal issues that examine him, and his father, a legendary good cop, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south (the implication is that Wai allows his father to rap his own corrupt relationship ). <br /> <br /> There is a car ride, lots of kills and a weird and awkward love story offered here, all played out in almost cartoon style. I suppose humor was deliberate (no one uses giant concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagant absurdity), although the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members. There are at least three points where the movie can be completed, and in 109 minutes it may have benefited from more ruthless editing or deletion of one of the narrative threads (the bright things worked well so I would have omitted the interaction with the three fathers ). <br /> <br /> I tend to give it a (high) passport but if only because of the end ?? I have rarely heard so many people laugh so much at what should have been an exciting moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
