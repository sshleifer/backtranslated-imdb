This show is amazing. I thought the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character because she was in the "dark side." I also thought Bridget was funny because she was all crazy. I also thought the guy playing Kyle was really really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic comments about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really fun. The whole whole TV show is fun and I wish they still showed it on TV. when they showed it on tv, i saw it every time it was on. Next time it shows, I'll see it again and again.
