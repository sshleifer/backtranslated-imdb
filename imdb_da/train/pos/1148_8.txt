This is one of those films - such as Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that hold a viewer's interest over and over again. Lightweight films rarely win Oscars, but the one who made the casting to Soapdish deserves one. Even after watching the movie and knowing what's coming up, it's still fun to see how the different plot facets evolve. True, everything is drama melodrama; but it is perfectly appropriate for a film with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can't I write, can I like it?" I think it is unfortunate that the TV and web sensors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
