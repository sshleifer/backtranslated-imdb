This is undoubtedly the best documentary ever produced, giving a precise and epic depiction of World War II from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945. Honestly and to the point documentary reproduces views from both sides of the conflict and gives a very human face for the war. At the same time, tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked, much work has been done to give a detailed picture of the war and especially the high, low and turning points of the Allied fortunes. Being a British-produced documentary film, this 26-part series focuses primarily on Britain, but Russia and America's contribution is not skimmed over this but only such an advantage of a series of such length. Another worthy mention is score, music and the whole feeling of the documentary is one of turmoil, struggle and endurance. Like a movie, the series does not leave the viewer as the Allies and Germans face during the war, it builds on a climax at the end of each episode that serves to store the rough second world war. Having seen all 26, the viewer is left with a vast knowledge of the war and astonished at how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.
