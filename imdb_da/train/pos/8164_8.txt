This movie was very entertaining, although you only like it if: - you hate to go to the dentist, but are not afraid of a movie where one of them goes bad - you love horror movies <br /> <br / > I especially wish that something was given to explain the protagonist's brutal actions. The fact that he is completely obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then captures his wives, giving some pleasure to the muddy pool man, is a pretty credible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> Like it. I give it a 8.
