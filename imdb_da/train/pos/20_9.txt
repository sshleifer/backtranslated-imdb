'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to become literary and realize its potential. For iris, finding the courage to love again is a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and continue. In that sense, it gives us a very good overview of how life is often and thus is credible. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the characters that were made to be consistent for the whole picture. The support supports are also carefully chosen and they add a depth so that the protagonists get meaningful meaning from the supporting ideas. All in all, an excellent movie. The best thing I take out of it is Hope.
