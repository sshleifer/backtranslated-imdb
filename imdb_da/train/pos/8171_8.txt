I understand that this review will make me rely on the expert film critics who patrol this site, but I will defend this movie. The dentist is actually a really good movie. The action is not always top notch, but the excitement is good and the story is good. Plus you can see Linda Hoffman's boobies. Not that I'm an expert in this area, but the direction works well and the plot makes sense. Corbin is doing a really scary dentist. It makes dentists what Jaws do for sharks ... ish. Of course, it had a relatively limited budget, but they did well with what they could, and developed the characters well (those who count). The end.
