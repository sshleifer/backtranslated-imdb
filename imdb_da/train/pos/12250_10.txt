Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad Knightly looked good like Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fantastic job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emma's father. I love the end stage (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the harvest is in and Knightly dines with his workers and high society friends. Emma must show that she accepts this now. She is a changed woman. It's too much too fast, but OK. I want to buy into it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's ex-governess and confidential. She is wonderful. just as I would have imagined her. I think when Britain makes a Jane Austen its best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this!
