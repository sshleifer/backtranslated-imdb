In the seemingly endless quest to find well-created, well-behaved horror films, finding one that even comes close to hitting the mark is far too rare. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon "Burned at the Stake" on a US cable network while flipping channels. The prerequisite is fairly simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vocal witness against alleged witches and smooths unfounded charges against anyone serving her dissatisfaction. Manipulating her to her own ends is the reverend parris (peter) who also serves as the court's guidance in witchcraft and satanic cases. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (from 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in the seventeenth century garb is trying to accost her there and the building. He continues to steal her, while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. It soon seems that she is obsessed with Ann Putnam's spirit. Unfortunately, further description becomes more involved and would give away too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and would probably be of little interest to many viewers, the performance is good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing. The production values ​​are fixed with the possible exception of some of the special effects. In a side note, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric but underrated horror movie can appreciate this. The author / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of "big bug" films and similar works years earlier.
