At the end of the 19th century, San Francisco, poorly-dressed Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) works on a bank and enjoys joining local "matches" (boxing) with fellow Jack Carson (like Walter Lowrie). One day, beautiful Alexis Smith (like Victoria Ware) enters "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so taken with Mrs Smith's elegant beauty that he offers to wear her retractable packaging. Smith is secretly taken with the beautiful Flynn but averted by his brashness. <br /> <br /> The fly's good deed (actual capture attempt) gets him a free membership in the snooty "Olympic Club" which conveniently includes a high school (with boxing equipment). The fly's supposed way and practical fun (he tickles men on the parallel bars) annoys the "Club" members. When an English book holiday visits the club, members endeavor to get Flynn to fight the man. They are hopeful Flynn will step down, humiliated by his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer produces Robert Buckner a great package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner certainly succeeded with his contribution (manuscript) to the studio's brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "gentleman Jim" - this story is apparently the movie of the real James J. Corbett's autobiography "The Crowd of Crowd" - but this film must be substantially fictionalized. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very appealing leading man; He maneuvered the manuscript easily and should have been recognized in the early 1940s as an outstanding actor. Many of Flyn's characterizations were (are?) Overlooked as good performances, and this is one of them. Black as beautiful as his feminine interest and sends her feelings to the viewer. Director Walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant. The support is a treasure chest, from the magnificent Alan Hale (like Pat Corbett) to attending Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
