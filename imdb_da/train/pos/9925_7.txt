When I rented Domino I was expected to be very stupid. I hate movies that have really flashy editing and filmography, and Domino has also received very bad reviews. The only reason I saw it is because I have had Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just enjoy the facts of fairy tale stories. Yes editing and cinematography was hectic, the story was weak, and the play was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for some bizarre reason. The dominoes were very, very entertaining and often very fun. It was terribly underestimated when it was released, I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scott's last movie, Man on Fire, and instead it just became entertaining entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved it and recommended it.
