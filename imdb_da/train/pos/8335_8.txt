While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is reason enough to watch this movie, the support cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and Jacobi, Saks and Maher's hilarious trio) is an added plus. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fiance, and Shalub's line of Einstein's gonads is, as mentioned, one of the highlights of the film. The speech that Robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is pure poetry. Kudos to the authors to handle this foam with joke and levity. I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. This may be considered a chick movie, but I think everyone will get a kick out of it. Eight very solid points.
