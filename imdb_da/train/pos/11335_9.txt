Jake's Closet has Kramer vs. Kramer's emotional power combined with Pan's Labyrinth's imagination. Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pan's Labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago, and so it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, a single child, almost alone on a summer vacation, dealing with his family falling apart. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a scary movie for the thinking person. If you're looking for a slasher movie, it won't be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a story that both touches and spans good acting, this is the movie for you. At the screening I saw I swear that there was a moment when the entire audience screamed. I highly recommend catching this movie.
