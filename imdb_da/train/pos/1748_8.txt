From the beginning I was so excited to watch this movie. The poster may be the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> <br /> Each item came together in this movie so beautifully. It's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay and racist jokes, so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver every raunchy joke sensationally. Carell stays sweet throughout the movie, where at the end of the movie you praise him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to be laid. The support is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we get. That's what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie is often brought up when the words "breast growth" and "condoms" are mentioned in conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching it in the theater, I was surprised at how many older people there were to see it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women coming in. Despite an older audience, this film still filled the theater with laughter. I think the kind of people who like this are fans of the office and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you want to see on Family Guy, too. The film is low enough for young boys and still sweet and smart enough for the Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of disgrace or if you are easily offended. But when you are in the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they are funny.
