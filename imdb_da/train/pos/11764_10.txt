Saw this in the theater in '86 and dropped out of my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best damn baseball player ever to have lived." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end, but it has a good time to get there. The training scenes are very fun, but the best scene can be one when Jack and Reno try to watch Falcon's Viking's Monday Night Football game while trying a makeup dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one, and it's too bad that it is overlooked as a top notch comedy.
