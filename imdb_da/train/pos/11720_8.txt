I don't expect much, and to be honest, I didn't like this movie the first time, but looked at it again and I realized it's pretty cool. Sure, it's a joke movie, but it's a fun gag. <br /> <br /> Someone wrote that it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie had the potential to be an over-the-top My cousin Vinny. But with a horror hosted instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is a wasted opportunity. With just a little more writing it could be a classic. The children are underused, there is no reason why they should be locked to Elvira. Except for the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but there are small differences that separate the good movies from the brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elvira itself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles you will too. It's hard to beat a movie when the protagonist is so charming. And it's really her charm, don't let her fool you into thinking she's a kind of pie. Well she's. But she is a good one. The kind of person you would care for your children. Wouldn't let her cook for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I'd recommend giving it a ride. <br /> <br /> Just don't expect too much. <br /> <br /> She's more than just a good set of breasts. She is also an incredible couple of legs.
