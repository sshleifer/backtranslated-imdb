I looked at "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was hit by how similar the story is to the very superior "Rebecca." As others have said, you have the sweet young thing swept off the feet of the alternating charming and embroidered gentleman of the manor, only to find her marriage threatened by the inevitable memory of a greater than lifetime but deeply deficient relative. You have the strict and unfair servant, a crisis that will either tie the couple together or tear them apart irreparably, climaxed by the lavish destruction of the lavish house. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" is also the cause of its creepy jungle atmosphere to "The Letter", the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation instead of a Sri Lankan tea plantation. <br/> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars and IMDb readers are not much cheeks, but I enjoyed it despite the predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked more legal, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basic good man who cannot shake his indulgent father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Life" - is wasted as Elisabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors in movie history.
