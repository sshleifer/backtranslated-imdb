Don't read anything about this movie (especially nothing that can contain any spoilers). Just watch this amazing movie without knowing it - and you'll have a great experience. If you like to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, grab the DVD, and you won't really be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, more a psychic thriller settled in the environment of globalized business. It's about business secrets, where large companies spy each other's research departments and the methods they use. The actors have a fantastic performance, and the film's overall visual style gives a perfect cold form. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs to the story and end - also much, much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali's other movie "Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I really don't say about every fifth well-made flick). Sorry, can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking damaging your experience. Just give it a try. ;-)
