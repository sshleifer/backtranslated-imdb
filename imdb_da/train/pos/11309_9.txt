A masterful treat by James Caines "The Postman Always Rings Twice" as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a rarely war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought to be destroyed, but Visconti saved a tap and fortunately we can see this early neo-realistic work today. A robust stylish Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently unveiled his breasts in La Cena delle beffe "(1941)) originate as the sensuously charged and bad lovers who plotted to kill their husband. Do not pay, pay in a way that is not directly related to the crime, excellent direction, scripts, plays and movies, the report is not as good as the French "Le Dernier Tournament" (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead.
