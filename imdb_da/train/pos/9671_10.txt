Paulie is a fantasy of a little girl or perhaps her memories of how her youth was like an adult. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs a flawless performance as a Russian researcher who can't find decent work in America. He turns to an isolated parrot while he performs an educator's duties in a behavioral laboratory. The principal teacher is a bitter man, whom Paulie, who can speak and understand languages ​​and teachings, confuses the doctor, who is later beaten to the lower levels of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. <br /> <br /> Paulie resumes his life with Marie and how they lost each other. The search begins to reunite Paulie with Marie, only more than 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some say predictably, with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the three who enter Mary's home, where you can make the final of your choice. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
