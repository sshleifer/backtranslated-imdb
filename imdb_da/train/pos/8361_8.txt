I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I began to see it, but I ended up suffering it. I would not call it vulgar ("stupid and stupid" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivingly stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, would not suffer or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or it seems), and the way in which two anti-aristocrats treat every woman they want to meet seems indelible. But the more I think about it the more I realize that it somehow comes out as a lovely little gem. I'm fascinated by how Blier could get away with it. The movie is very entertaining and very entertaining: it is well-written, the play of all is first-rate, and the music is sweet and melancholy. In fact, when I thought about it, two friends had done some good for the women they came across: they were preparing a woman on the train (the lovely fat blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debut in René Clément's "Forbidden Games" (1952) aged 6) to the meeting with her husband, whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who could finally get a freed Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) abandoned and satisfied; the enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screens). Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau raises this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I would like to meet Gérard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I was happy to watch the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.
