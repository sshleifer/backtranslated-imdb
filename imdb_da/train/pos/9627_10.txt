This is by far the funniest card made by the two comic geniuses. From the time they enter, to the time Hardy just falls off the roof, it keeps me laughing hysterically. I strongly suggest that each fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this card. I also recommend all the Ghost Series. If you're looking for laughs then watch this movie and you'll be happy.
