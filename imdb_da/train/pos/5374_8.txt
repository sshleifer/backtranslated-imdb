William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buys an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very poor condition for the purpose of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, horrible events happen in the house, including Sophie's cat. In Sophie's birthday party, a tube of blood leaks and they leave the site and reveal a secret later. <br /> <br /> "The House That Bled to Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes of the "Hammer House of Horror" series. The amazing twist, revealing a secret, and the tragic conclusion is really excellent. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House That Bled to Death")
