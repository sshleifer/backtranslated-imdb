This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the US: it exposes our murderous foreign policy to what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another great movie from this era, Rendition, was also totally rejected, simply because it showed exactly that the US is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering and abusing civilians in its quest for total world domination. . A clever plot, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) And some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicated in mass murder.
