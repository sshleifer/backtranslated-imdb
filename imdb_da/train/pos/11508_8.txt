I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show went quickly from frightening / exciting to stupid. ABC's fault. They moved the show to Friday night at 8:00 am, known as the "family hour". Never should have been on Friday in the first place. I was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes! It was first up against Police Woman on NBC. ABC had big problems on Friday night. Bad season for them together until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuted in January of '75. Kolchak should have been a hit. Darren McGavin asked to get out of his contract to finish the show. Too bad was the writing not up to Richard Matheson in the original TV movies. Still, McGavin Kolchak made his own, which actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker comes to mind. That INS put with manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and old today, but it was part of the appeal. They were very fortunate to have Simon Oakland replay "Vincenzo" from the television films.
