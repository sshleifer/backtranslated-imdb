Like others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon I propose because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such a fare "all out" can follow and enjoy the history of this movie and plot lines very well. set on a planet other than the 20th century earth except for series like "Flash Gordon". Leslie Nielsen was vocal weak for his role at the time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all acquitted themselves very well. There are so many visual splendors in this, it's hard to choose a favorite from the movie scenes. The access to Altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of rocket launch, dr. morbius house seen from the outside and inside, the underground complex and its wonders, the weapon's set-up, the battle with the monster, the final approa ch of the invisible destroyer, the escape from the condemned planet - all these scenes are etched in the viewer's mind because we discover them together with the participants. Veteran Cyril Hume's literary script was intelligently filmed by long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize that there is no music at all; The film is worn by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation story. It can be seen again and again with pleasure - I've been doing it for almost fifty years. Until this famous and beloved movie was created, no film had attempted to imagine a world beyond Earth; And for decades, ships were crashed back onto the planet - as if the writer's fantasies fail and cause crashes. Still the best that many people say. It says something negative about the country's so-called intellectual leader's imagination - and something very positive I actually suggest to those who made this gem.
