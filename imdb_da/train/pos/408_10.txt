I can't tell everyone how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this movement is "too confusing" or "like swimming in concrete drying". I say these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you got into the Oriental Adventures), I'm just sorry I couldn't see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen tv :-)
