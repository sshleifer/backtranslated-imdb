This is really one of the "Golden Age" in Hollywood, the kind they don't do anymore. It's a unique, fun movie that keeps you guessing what will happen next time. <br /> <br /> All actors are the perfect cast and they are all major supporting actors. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman in it and I've been a fan of his since then. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite actor of mine and adds some quality to every movie he is in. While he played another kind of character here, he still added something to the movie that another actor who threw in that character would not have added.
