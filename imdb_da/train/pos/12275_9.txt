I have never heard of the book or I don't care to read it, but I will probably see the film many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with perhaps the richest image I've ever seen in a movie. It was as if I had many paintings, which I thought was the idea. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movies, history, actors and movies. Full of deep emotions from every angle. Although I'm not particularly fond of romance films, I loved it here and was deeply moved by Winona Ryder's plea to her father towards the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved a prize for his performance, and Luk was never better. <br /> <br />
