Each scene was overall perfect. This movie had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. In it, no one will ever exist. He has the ability to enlighten any movie with his amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie all alone on a movie block in "Blockbuster" and it was like calling me, I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me a sappy romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention made me laugh with joy at the same time. Although it made me cry, I finally admit that the whole movie just enlightened my outlook on life then. I suggested to my scare, action and a pure humor film from a brother who absolutely loved this movie. This is a movie with a good feeling. It can make you laugh loudly, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy your life. Every time you purposefully pass this movie, be aware that you are deliberately choosing to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? What if it really could happen to you, and watch the mysterious wonders of life.
