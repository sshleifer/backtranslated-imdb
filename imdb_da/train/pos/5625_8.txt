Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being attracted to a lonely cyclist. She is mortally shaken by her attacker knowing her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo) forces his attacker into Marjorie's home and submits her to humiliating terror. Broken and bloody, Marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker, knocking out the live daylight out of the jerk and making him helpless thanks to the squeeze spray in her eyes and neck. Hog bound and raped, Joe tries to explain to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfri Woodard) when they come home. There is almost a hint of grace, but it doesn't come from Marjorie. Should she continue to make her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and gross language make for an R rating. Fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that are forever patching their career. Kudos to Director Robert M. Young.
