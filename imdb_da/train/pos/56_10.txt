This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been directed by Larry Clark, this story about a school recording would probably have been shown through the eyes of the murderers, and anything that led the person to go mad at first. </ br /> <br /> Instead, the plot focuses primarily on the aftermath of a school shooter and how it performed the victims who survived. <br /> <br /> I had seen busy Phillips in other movies before, but her performance in this movie is far, her best. The only other movie I've seen with Erika Christensen is "Swimmer Fan", which made me hardly want to watch this movie, but she became a very good performance herself. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen, was actually able to make me cry. Trust me when I tell you, it doesn't happen very often. Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is ...
