Ashanti is a very 70s kind of film (1979, to be precise). It reminded me of the wild geese in a way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It is also a very good movie, and I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman called Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who has graduated in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While the PhDs, one day she is spoken by slaves working for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, by all people). The rest of the movie is David trying to get her back. Of course, Michael Caine is a brilliant actor and plays a character who is very determined and willing to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. He first helped out an Englishman fighting the slave trade that no one recognizes going on (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then by an Arabian called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a chance to settle down with Suleiman (he is very intense throughout, a very engaging character) and then rides with David to find him and get Anansa back - it involves a wonderful scene where David fails to come on his camel. <br /> <br /> Then there's lots of adventure. There are also many moral issues. The history of history is a little predictable from this point, and there are a few freedoms involved in plotting to move things faster, but it is all beautifully forgiving. The question is, will David come to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells her to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is in it!)?
