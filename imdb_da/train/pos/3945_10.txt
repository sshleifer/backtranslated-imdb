The rating is only a 5 because it is a movie that could have used better acting and direction (or at least music!). But for Walt Whitman's performance he deserves a 10. A former poster calls the movie cheesy, but I think it's a simple case not to see the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than having a Hollywood shining feature film. And for this I am delighted - the fact that it is non-mainstream reflects Whitman's life as well. This film is more documentary than acting. To be fascinated by a story like this, when you rarely hear about these types of stories that shape today's present mental health, the most important thing is. I found it a very enjoyable look at the story.
