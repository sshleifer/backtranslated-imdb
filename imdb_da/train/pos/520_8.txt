My only slight drawback to the movie, I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is referring to the last twenty minutes in the trial scene. And the test itself, the IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY that provides the liveliest and most credible performance. French accent MARIUS GORING is a joy (he even comes in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his war period dies unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> See this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a prime example of what a wonderful 1946 movie was for. Technicolor photography, slightly subdued and not at all garish, is excellent, and the way it switches to B&W for the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the kind that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of history - and the Niv's tense talk with the radio operator Hunter, while his plane collides with the earth, unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. Really a fantastic movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
