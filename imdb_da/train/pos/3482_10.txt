This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I write it is that we are talking about one of the best movies ever! "Ne goryuy!" will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not a fan yet!) with Georgian choir singing tradition, and perhaps you will accept adversity in your own existence and just feel good after seeing it :) What I do much about this film is that actors in the non-leading roles create vibrant and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The movie starring Vahtang Kikabidze (which is amazing), but you will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find yourself quoting their lines that have become household names for so many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live with. Simple but deep, you would like to see it again and again.
