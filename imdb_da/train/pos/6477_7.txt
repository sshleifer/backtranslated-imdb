"Five Days" is billed as something special, a criminal drama consisting of a series of episodes, each set on a particular day with a political query. But in reality, this element of history shows to be somewhat less significant than perhaps first in mind, as the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is hardly noticeable, and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories. In fact, one can hardly help drawing comparisons with the last 'Prime Suspect', as one of the sub-goals focuses on a single cynical female policeman approaching retirement: and it's not just the absence of Helen Mirren making the comparisons unfavorable. There is a lot of serious overmoding, manipulative music and a set of signs that are apparently constructed so that each one is somehow sympathetic to another suspicious. And it is possible to guess the culprit well before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the stories, but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true, to justify the way the series focuses on particular signs at specific times. Despite these shortcomings, the series grew on me: in the end, I was completely grabbed. But it is a boring sign that the BBC, who once did as 'The Singing Detective', boasted of this "possibly the best drama of the year": for there is a little genuine originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is terribly disappointing. "Five days" is actually no nonsense; But it is formal, and one would hope that the very best BBC would offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh.
