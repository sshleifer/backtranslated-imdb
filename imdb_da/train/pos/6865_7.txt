With the current trend of gross humor, this movie is farewell to all of them. While some of the humor is dated, each shit will either shock, repulse or make you laugh aloud. Most memorable is the sex game commentary and of course the VD advertisement. It does not always work, but pays off when it does. I give this a 7.
