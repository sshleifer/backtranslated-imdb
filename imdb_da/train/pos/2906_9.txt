A hilarious Action comedy where Damian Szifron kills Díaz, a policeman whose wife has cheated him. He lives in a hotel that feels guilty of his wife's adultery, falls into depression, he cares carefully, drives red light just for fun and feels sad. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who doesn't trust the police at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, which are unable to refuse because of the conditions of his probation. Soon the situation will turn back when Silberman finds out that his wife is cheating him and ending up being comforted by the person he was supposed to help, a person he didn't believe in at first. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Strange characters in a nice comedy about friendship and heroism.
