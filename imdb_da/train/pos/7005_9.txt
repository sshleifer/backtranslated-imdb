When the DVD was released I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was the right way I expected before buying it. Awesome movie what I can say to Will Smith, He has been a great actor as always, whether he is acting film or seriously. He always gives a record-breaking ability. I think it's the movie after August Rush that makes a person cry while he sees it. The way the instructor described the story was truly amazing. His past life and his new life in film were properly drafted to the audience. Even I couldn't find any errors in the story or the way they shoot it. I think its DVD must be a household because it will be really good for your collection. It's not the movie that needs pop-corns for enjoyment, it's the movie that makes the audience learn a lesson. Now what is the lesson you can see while you look. And I advise the people who are film critics, please see this if you could find any criticism of this movie, so talk to me.
