Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) banished from his kingdom because his father (king) is killed by the clich "evil counselor". This movie is about Simon's adventure. The special effects, plot, acting and generally are all about this movie BAD. But it's so bad it's fun. You will keep an eye on this movie simply because it is so bad it is fun and as the other reviewer of the movie said it is so bad it is good.
