Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and fascinating. I looked surprised as Edith's Jr. and Sr. bickered and performed while reminiscing their past. Their existence in a counterfeit mansion (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie you will not soon forget.
