This fortunate, fortunate 1939 military swashbuckler, quite loosely attached to Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel "Soldiers Three," qualifies as the premier entertainment of the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers several knock-up battles with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all his films put together. Seen in distant India, this sex-fisted yarn is exploited by three robust British sergeants and their native water carrier Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), fighting a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called Thuggee. Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen from "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of The Dawn Patrol) is a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-hitting and fun-loving alpha men whose years of frolic are at to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the industry. Cutter and MacChesney, of course, join different schemes to track Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them back to action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so he can't accompany them and Ballantine will replace him. Half of the fun here is to see the protagonists trying to persuade each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in great style and scope as our heroes topple with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black and white filmography.
