I thought the original of this movie was quaint and charming, and I sat on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out. When I had already seen the original when I saw this on the Sci Fi Channel - I don't know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was within the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as a drawing actress, I wanted to see how he would remove it. <br /> <br /> The authors / producers, etc. Modernized the movie a bit by trying to explain the situation of "foreigners" (they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudoscience that is been crammed into our ears in the 90s. Maybe it added a little Polish to the movie or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Movie? This production takes a more eerie edge than the original did. The original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien, and an understanding of varieties occurred, even though there was no solution to Alien's problem. <br /> <br /> I remember the woman in this remake was pretty hostile to Burgi / Alien-I think it could be better. But the end is just the end, and the yarn is a yarn that is the basic 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock. Many great science fiction stories were written in the 50s and some of them made it into movies. <br /> <br /> This is a bulging thing to watch as a rainy day or something. I rate it strongly cos of all the remakes of old 50's Sci Fi, this one came well. I actually enjoyed it here. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to see this story told well, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
