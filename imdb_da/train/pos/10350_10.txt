I think they tell the truth all the time. You can't trust anything in nature ... Your family went through hell. The bad boys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But still have to deal with the rumors. As well as dealing with the loss of their little sister. I can't believe this case continued for so long. As the jury could not see the truth, even though it bitten them on the ass. I feel for this family and if I could tell them I hate what happened to them I wanted. I have no idea what they went through, I can't imagine it. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to check on my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should look at this.
