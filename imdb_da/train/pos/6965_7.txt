This movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is chain-hanging, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has the power and abilities beyond mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without destroying the movie, I can assure you not, but it is very fun to be on the road. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super hero, an uberbabe, mysteriously named G-Girl, who, unlike most in his sisterhood, is not * always * dedicated to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as the thoroughly daring, yet still retrieves curator Jenny. When she gets dumped into a less gifted, but more emotionally secure and well-adjusted rival, G-Girl goes ballistic, and the follow is not beautiful. It's fun, but it's not beautiful. It's a nice premise, hell has no rage like a superhero, and those involved don't make it off, but it has its moments, and I think I'll get the DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
