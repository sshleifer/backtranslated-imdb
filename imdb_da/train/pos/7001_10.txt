I have never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I've read comments that say this movie stays with you. It does. It has been almost 24 hours and I am still quite concerned. This movie left me questioning my own self. How can I possibly compare myself to a character like Ben who is completely selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering to the end. I feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sorrow. A great feeling good movie and a very sad one too. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but eventually they were forever. If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you don't have distractions. You want to see all the nuances in this image. One for my library.
