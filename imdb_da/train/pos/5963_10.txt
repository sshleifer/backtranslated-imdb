This movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest chase scene ever. When Eddie dumbs milk at Tim, he gets chased down at a time. Eddie puts obstacles in the jocks with funny consequences (like a cymbal that nails a trumpet player, buy the DVD and watch it slowly). The best obstacle is a knocked mop bucket that a jock jumps over, but continues to slide on the ground out of a door. But when he slips, he picks up speed and thereby tolerates physics (mainly friction); But what lies behind the door is supreme. The steepest stair case in any school ever, as this jock continues to CLEAR in the air. In fact, he would probably die of a broken neck. Not only does he control all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go buy this. Believe me this scene is worth your 6 bucks.
