A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town and have to deal with a medieval teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a hell of a great secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, so technically it's a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so much fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving corn) happen, people cheat on kitty cats, there are bad one-liners, there is too much cheese to deal with! <br /> <br /> So yes. You will enjoy this. A lot. It will not move you, touch you, scare you, or buckle you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughed!
