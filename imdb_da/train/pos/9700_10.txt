Somehow, this movie manages to be refreshing, bittersweet and heartwarming at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins her life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi Girl) with a speech disorder. While she is learning to speak correctly, it also does Paulie. But, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a peasant shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc. While traveling all over the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several fates until Paulie ends up with a laboratory where he is eventually tucked away in a basement and found by a Russian steward who is affected by the bird's history. The plot is in line with the simple, metaphorical theme that languages ​​are a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful blend of whistle, digital base and horn enhances the film for pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and the stunning scenery admire the story even more. And as a final note, the dolls are completely credible. (Unlike the Star Wars, where Yoda looks like a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite films, with the added remark that my wonderful four-year parachute died recently. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
