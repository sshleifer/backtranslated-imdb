From the first scene you get guides on what can happen here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on. The action is excellent all the time, and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what would happen, I was very confused by the subject. I'm still amazed at why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "other thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his feelings and emotions. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it left me confused. Maybe it was the meaning of the movie. I liked the movie, and Wil Smith can make another great movie choice. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
