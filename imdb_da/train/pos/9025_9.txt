The movie belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little actress to history with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with lots of well-done secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey. That's it and more. I agree with those who say "The movie celebrates the excitement of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The movie is a pleasant reminder that performance can be born of common roots. <br /> <br />
