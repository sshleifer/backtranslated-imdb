SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just saw the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I wish they would have left the original version on the DVD. Portabello Road could have been cut to its original length. It was too long and pulled the film together. Although the dance is amazing, it would have been much better back on the DVD as a deleted scene. All in all, it's a good movie. My 5 year old liked it. And it's great that movies I enjoyed as a child are passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just as I had remembered! <br /> <br /> *** out of **** <br /> <br />
