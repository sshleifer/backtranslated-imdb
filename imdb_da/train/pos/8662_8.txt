I liked this very much. In fact, if I see it again (and I'm planning on that), I can just love it. I will repeat other reviewers by saying that this movie really grows on you as you see it. It starts a bit slowly, but the road in enfolds is very natural and has a mood for it. You just get into it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summery atmosphere of the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism, and the film awakens very slowly and gently a spelling as you become involved in the various interactions between them all and will know how it will ultimately prove and which paths the characters will choose to take. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - there are unclear TV movies that have more comments, so Rich In Love. One thing I want to say that I missed the end is driving me crazy and I have to see it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone but which I feel is heavily underestimated (even some of my most film-like purist friends who have seen almost all movies have not seen this) and it does not even seem to have much of a bulletin board, but I liked it a lot and for all those who like family dramas, there is warmth on the landscape, the atmosphere and an eerily dull tempo, should probably take a look at this. Particularly worthy is that it is in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the south and the movies taking place there, it's a gem. I want to add my voice to the extremely few comments and recommend this little-known flick.
