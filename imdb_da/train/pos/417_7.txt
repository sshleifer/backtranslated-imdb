This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford play the bad guy selling weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. It was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next movie that was made was pretty much the same but put on another time. This movie starts with Lincoln's murder and it is also about an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill, and Buffalo Bill is married and will now stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from precise. Gary Cooper is good as usual, and I usually don't like Jean Arthur, but I liked her here.
