Australian Fred Schepisi dishes a comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ that gets taller with Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (sleepless in Seattle, you've got mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent but not as confident mathematician. Maybe it's because she's surrounded by all that genius. She believes that if she marries a person with a high I.Q. her children will have a high I.Q. so good, but she doesn't know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins sweet smile and Meg's cuteness, this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to the James James Moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. This is a love a first point of view situation, between mechanic and mathematician. Witty lines and subliminal lines! The kinematics are great. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With great help from all the brilliant men, Catherine falls to Ed without knowing that he is a car mechanic. Favorite Images: Ed takes a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein are driving on the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leave all the experimental animals free! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Albert Einstein: "Don't Let Your Brain Disturb Your Heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Now I'm sure I don't know." This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape and every time I want to see it again.
