These are films like these that make you want you never opted for the nerd that grows up in school. If you liked this movie, then I suggest you see Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released, which is a shame when he did a good job. I wonder if it is because of the part he played in the movie. It starts when Carol tricks him into entering the girls' toilet to act like they should. When he switched to the showers, Carol's popular friends sucked into the bathroom and got everything clear, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opened the curtain pad naked, he realized he was being fooled. He tries to cover up the shower, but the kids open it, take Marty and start being mediocre to him while the camera rolls. They picked him up, pounded his head in the toliet while it was being flushed, and they electricity him (a little). When the children are in detention, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that causes him to vomit. Skip one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to apologize to him. While Marty is drinking in the toilet, Skip jumps into the Science Lab and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but not sure what it was. The lab is blowing up to disturb him badly. Five years later, the children who plagued him that day invited invitations to a 5-year-old school association at the old school that burned the day it exploded. One by one, the people are killed by. I don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have been backed up after Marty back. She almost came out the first time.
