I waited a moment to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary point of view, I found that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it had to do, show me something, I had no idea and kept interested in this world it explored. I didn't know anything about the Drag world and found out and "Balls" was just spectacular for me. These people were just as good at what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty people, the complainants (although I was angry when someone told the judge that the robe was dragging the dragons was not a man's coat!), The jealous is it all there as in any other competition. Like all other competitions like that. As I felt was a point. <br /> <br /> You had the older dragon queen talking about how the "used" balls were compared to the newer drones that have changed the balls and made several categories of competition - and even those who were looking to know that The future of balls would change even more as they were ready to go on the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the participants lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to compete, it was so important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories of who were "house" and "housewife" brought out the best and the brightest competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now to add after 10 years of watching this movie, I lived through the so-called 'Madonna' craze. I saw a few well-known faces from this documentary that ended with Madonna during his "Vogue" phase and rightly so. If not for the individuals, Madonna would not have a "Vogue" phase, I know now. Credit must be given where credit is DUE. Asking me if anyone from mainstream America would see this documentary, they will learn that they are not as "mainstream" as they think.
