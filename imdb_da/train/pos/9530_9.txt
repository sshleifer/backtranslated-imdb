Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great film photographer completed his famous career with this movie before moving on. He made himself proud as this is one of the best crime movies you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, the play is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman to play the leaders! The amount of effort here is just as true too: not too much; Not too little. None of the characters here are frankly "good guys" when Hanks is a professional hitman for the city's chief Newman. Hanks' only redeeming quality is not that his young son should shut down a murderer like him, even though he does not teach him how to be the executioner in robberies! Huh? As good as the play is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this movie cinematographer Hall is painting the scene after a beautiful scene with the lens. His work is just amazing.
