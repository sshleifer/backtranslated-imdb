I watched the movie with a gay friend, my wife and her friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. For the most part, the film made me laugh, the sexual excitement wasn't right there, and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think she played her role well, even though the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian players around, they just didn't have complex roles. I welcome Puya's entry into the film industry. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he's a good actor. The wife loved the movie and I think there might have been chords being played and I didn't have ear to. If the film tried to present unusual sexual behavior and their consequences in today's Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story just becomes a boring, uninteresting plot. I have no idea why it got all these BAFTA prices. In my book, it should have received the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
