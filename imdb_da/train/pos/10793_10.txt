There are a few spoilers in this comment !! Unlike the comments I just read from nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series. /> <br /> I'm a Judson Mills fan, but also a great Chuck Norris fan, and while I admit that some of the action scenes might have stretched the line a bit, the story fits right into other weekly series that are currently issued. <br /> <br /> The opening fifteen minutes of Deke running from the evil guys after blasting their missiles was very action-packed. I fail to see how the many "professionals" could not hit a moving target, but the action was certainly there, and Deke, the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment about having "get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs." This film was not originally planned by CBS for a January airing and filming was completed in May 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the United States <br /> <br /> If the commentary's author had been aware of the movie instead of trying To avoid it, perhaps they would have realized the plot of history: Rashid, a Bin Laden character, planned to extinguish an atomic device in the United States. The president's husband was summoned to find and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it. <br /> <br />
