I was unhappy with this movie on TV, and I couldn't leave it .... It's really a great movie that makes people learn about American history with the Vietnam War, the time of the flower, the struggle of racism .... It illustrates the conflict of generation, political perception of race that took place in the 60s .... I was born in 1980, so I didn't know all the things before ... In France, the history of America is not a priority and it movies taught me a lot of facts! That way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than once every day !! It's really amazing .... for a shame it just seemed on TV not in the theaters ... <br /> <br />
