A wonderful early musical film by Rene Clair, as fun and witty as his silent "The Italian Straw Hat". Using sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influences early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is heavily influenced by Le Million, for example). Should (but not) be seen by all the cinephiles, and the Criterion DVD is as good as you would expect. There is not a lot of extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on the disc is one I had never seen. Get it while it's still around.
