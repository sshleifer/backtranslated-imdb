the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual excitement than such american trials as 9 and a half weeks ... the courtroom scene itself ... with the couple copulating in the cage while the hero cares for their orgasm ... i'm fantastic .. I haven't seen this movie in 20 years ... but it made indelible images in my heart ... it's rich in texture and success in creating a world where sex is the engine of all activity, and at the bottom it is yawning anxiety that lives in all of us .... the plot is european and it winds a little, but it does life ... especially when you are 17 and constantly struggling ....
