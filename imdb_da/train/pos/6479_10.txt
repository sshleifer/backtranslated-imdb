This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a great WWII buff I had learned a lot before I saw this series. One of the best things about it is all interviews with previous individuals left when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, relatively speaking. It's nothing against the men you see being interviewed in today's programs, just because most of these men were not really involved in the top echelons of what happened then. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but really believe that only mortals (like myself) will buy this or see it more than once. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some of the facts are not as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply incorrect in places. This information is now different, as we now know because of the fall of the Soviet Union. All in all, a fascinating look at World War II and a must for any serious second world historian professional or personal.
