Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the manuscript, Pickup on South Street is a hard, brutal, well-filmed movie about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark), which unfortunately buys top-hung microfilm and becomes a target for spy agents. Also involved is Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by his evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at best, and though the performance is very good, the great character actor Thelma Ritter is stealing the movie. As Moe a tired street peddler sells collars (and who also sells information) she is fantastic in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Oscar and she never won. This should have been the role that cut it for her!
