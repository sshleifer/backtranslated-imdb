Reason: A crime commander unites 3 different mafias into a contract to buy an island, which then serves as money laundering for organized crime. To counter that, the FBI is trying to bust one of the mafia gentlemen. The case goes wrong, and in some unlikely plot terms, we are presented with another "cop who does not like each other" movies ... one is a female FBI agent and the other a male ex-DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the strength of this movie is not in its history - a bad joke at best. It is fun. (At least the synchronized German version is). The action is also good with a memorable scene with a shotgun and a rocket launch. But the focus is entirely on humor. Not intelligent satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get many fun jokes. <br /> <br /> But this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is highlighted prominently, without criticism, and even shows it so cool. It's a bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me and makes it unfit for kids, in my opinion. <br /> All in all, it is a good evening to see acceptable action with some fun jokes. This movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door as you enter the cinema / TV room. Then you're fine. 8.10
