"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought-out movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. I was not disappointed. At the end of the movie I was confused. I couldn't get it out of my mind. The whole idea of ​​it just blew me away. The end was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The baseline was also something that kept me interesting through and through. Cast, fantastic. It was a wonderful movie. That kind of movie you can see over and over and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times, and I always find something new. It's a movie that keeps you interested forever.
