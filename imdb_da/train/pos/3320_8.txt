I liked this movie, sweet and fun.I found this movie to be a good family movie. The shameful part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Be sure to tell Yankees fans. I recommend this picture to the whole family. Of course, with your typical love / comedy movie, there is a long moment in the movie, with I am in love and what I do, but the movie does it with all slapstick moments.The movie show is some moments of how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) how fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always turned up at the end of the season and how love for the Sox and the love of another person go hand in hand.
