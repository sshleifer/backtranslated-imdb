Beautifully done, and along with "New Travel" it is a great continuation! Fab to see James Cawley in the recent episode "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and think we have good replacements for the TV actors in a fan-produced piece. This show manages to capture the feeling quite well, as they say, it has been improved over the years with experience, and I hope with more experience, a strong script editor and a timing pickup and CGI that HF ​​will <br /> <br /> Good work for everyone interested! <br /> <br /> (I have a big soft spot for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT acting), although I'm "a little tired of" Lefler's love. Someone already! Shelby is great (if a little uptight), and It's cool, she's got the ship. Commodore Ian is nice (like Fred Flintstone) but lacks a commandant's edge and seems too happy with herself. What a beautiful accent - a real Russian! (Well, I guess Rene hails from the Czech rep.) <br /> <br /> It's my voice, and CGI is kewl. Some of the green screens are obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> Really happy I did it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some of the play is not good, but it's fan-made and can therefore vary - sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay material is too thick (Graham Norton would be embarrassed) Trek doesn't pay much attention to heterosexual couples so why signposted gays with all snogging? It is not necessary to emphasize the sexuality of others to this extent - I hope they talk it down and let Aster & Zen be people who are not tokens - I do not treat my gay friends differently. They are just regular guys. <br /> Musically, it's a mixed bag. I can tell all his stock Trek cheese stuff and work most of the time, but timing can fall now and then (end of "Worst Fears Part 2" misses the crunch and editing. Love the fact that they use "Galaxy Quest") "music! I certainly can't wait more !! Dazza <br /> <br />" Never give up, never surrender! "<br /> <br /> Viva les frontieres
