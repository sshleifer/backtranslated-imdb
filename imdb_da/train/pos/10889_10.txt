What about all the negative comments? Having seen this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a great holiday comedy that will surely brighten up a lonely person's day. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up spending the holidays alone, I would cry. You will need to watch the movie if you want to know why. Even though I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were the right snobs. But this movie made me smile and feel good inside. Before I unpack it, I'd like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a clean holiday hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this great holiday comedy that will surely enlighten a lone person's day to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasn't seen it.
