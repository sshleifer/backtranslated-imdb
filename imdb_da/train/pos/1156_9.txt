Many years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was so rewarded for finding it. It is a wonderful spear of soap, with louvres, the insecurity of the usual actors and all sorts of lovely profits. But more than anything - a fantastic cast and an incredible script. How did anyone get all the top-notch players to play in such a silly movie? And how did this little movie writer write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone about this movie or even admit to hearing it, but it's great and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I turn it on while doing housework, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying it all wonderful. Many congratulations to everyone who did.
