Let us think of people, stop losing the original, for that time, the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece, still with all the stars, stories and art. Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect when Apollo and Dirk Benedict were fun as Starbuck, but I dare say not as beautiful as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar, God's war, the best was Experiment in Terra, I thought it was a tribute in a way that Heaven can wait, Then you had Battlestar's women, not to compare them, so let's say Tricia, which is incredibly beautiful as number six, but Jane Seymour's beauty could not be compared to. Once again, Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was amazing. She had the beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed. I loved the original as much as the new one. Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
