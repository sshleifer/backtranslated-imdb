As the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, whether one focuses on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people have to behave a little better for each other. It has somehow passed a Ebenezer Scrooge, a merchant and money lender in the 19th century in London. <br /> <br /> When his nephew points to his uncle, he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels it is all humbug. Humanism in Scrooge was run long ago, he is a hard case, a lot like his 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> However, as Charles Dickens told this tale, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social comment from the 19th century Britain as Oliver Twist was. The characters in this movie are middle and subclass. Cratchits are a few steps above the street people of Oliver Twist, but they have to fight to stay up there. Still love and happiness radiate their homes, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit is working for. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and just had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge had a wake up call about the potential he still had to do something good in this old world. <br /> <br /> In his live performances and filmed games, Patrick Stewart has taken over Scrooge's part. But George C. Scott captures the old miser in this movie. The inhuman of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us rotate for him to change. Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, both of whom have made good interpretations of Scrooge. Among the supporting roles, I especially enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a solid and holy spirit of Christmas. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that they have filed and is one of the best.
