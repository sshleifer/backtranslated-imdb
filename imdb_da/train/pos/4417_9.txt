This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban city year round the Castro revolution. It is a manifestly true worthy love force. <br /> <br /> The name CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just trying to erroneously market this as an action movie. DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is only a disadvantage for people's everyday life and pursuits. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this era of Cuban history. The exaggerated use of the voice-over narrator undermines history, but the film makes it an unconditional clip from Hollywood movies that say so much more visually than the narrator could. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and fair play, as the film grows melancholy on film, but there is an underlying pain in the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the movie JULIE, never seems to have an end.
