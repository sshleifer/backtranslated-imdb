The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) Local and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collector's item. Unfortunately, all we got was an acceptable 2-star "decent" flick, mostly memorable for what it was trying to do ......... bring an art house mainstream. The small town locale and the story of ordinary people is a genre for itself, and if well done, they will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda was unable to conceal her braininess enough to make her character credible. I wondered why she didn't do a postdoctoral fellow at Yale instead of working in a death factory job in Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was just a little too constructed. An illiterate, a lovely guy who turns out to be with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. <br /> <br /> This genre has been more successfully handled by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-90s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt." I want the mainstream studios to try more things this fall and reserve a few screens on the multi-cinema complexes for these efforts. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a "A" for effort.
