Despite George Lucas' patronage, this captivating and completely original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cutouts) is as far away from the usual kiddie ticket as something that Ralph Bakshi did in his thriving time. Brilliantly conceived characters such as Shifting Dog Ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the hilarious wild-mouthed villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous beginner superhero) draw life into a unique smart concept: Frivoli vs Murkwood or the eternal battle between dreams and nightmares. In that context, MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow they do. It is therefore a real shame that I have had to see this through a really crappy-look boot (deleted from a television screen) of the uncensored version ?? There is also a milder variant that toned the language for its VHS release ?? otherwise the movie is not available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacity.
