This show is totally worth seeing. It has the best cast of talent I've seen for a very long time. The prerequisite for the show is unique and fresh (I think the leaders on ABC are not used as well, as it was not another reality show). But this show was credible with sympathetic characters and amazing stories. I'm probably not in the age group, they expect to like the show as I am in my forties, but many of my friends loved it too (late 30s and mid 40s) and die for quality shows with talented cast members. I don't think this show got enough time to get an audience. I think that considering more time, this show would have done very well. Once again, ABC doesn't give a real-potential show a real chance. With so many shows given chance after chance and not so much worth it! They must provide quality shows a real chance and time to really click and get an audience. I really loved the characters and was looking forward to seeing each episode. I've seen the episodes on ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We will see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it's possible to save this show from extinction. It has certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN ONLINE PETITION TO ABC ON: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
