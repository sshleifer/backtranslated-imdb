What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, it's full of action. <br /> <br /> In producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's about the nomenclature. With character monkeys like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars idealized with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it is only the non-stop action that keeps you from just playing the names played. <br /> <br /> Not a deep script in any way, but it's a great instrument for action when Nicolas Cage, like Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of car theft to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the 1974 cult trunk, this movie may not be destined for the same cult status, but it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it is the act that keeps you in mind not to act. Although starred, none of them have standout performances, including a very poor performance of one of my favorite experiences, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who comes from her latest Oscar winner, is just a token of love interest with almost no screen time. Can a number of beautiful cars and the car chases they get involved in making a good movie? I think. The movie is a pleasure to watch, and although a particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelief, the action is non-stop, and the excitement is convincing. Just be careful that other drivers are fighting for a pole position when you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
