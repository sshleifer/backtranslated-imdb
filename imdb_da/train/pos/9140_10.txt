I love this movie !!! Little Rain came out in the year I was born and it has had my heart since I remember. The prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special show of Purple Rain last night, and it was like a concert I was happy to see some true fans, because this movie is so undervalued, it's really one of the best movies all the time. The music is uncontrollable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest action in town, and he has eyes on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color, I can thank "The Kid" for that. So if you haven't seen this then you have to do as little as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
