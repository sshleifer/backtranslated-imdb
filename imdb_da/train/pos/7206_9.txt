Excellent plot within a plot within a plot. Shame about two of my movie heroes who have a good snake. Must be my upbringing :) <br /> <br /> Very well traded by everyone. You never quite know who is going out, do who. The last little twist at the end allows everyone to get their just deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. A harmless tongue in the cheek's thriller, which, if it is wrong, is probably Michael Cain's use of the word "bloody", but that's his signature, it is not. <br /> <br /> 9/10
