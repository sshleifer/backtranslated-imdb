Quite a heartfelt little movie and not just for the kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any clue about Morse inspector about him). The boy who played William also did a good job even though I didn't find him convincing in all the scenes. I loved the whole feeling of the little village and the slower pace of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London, where historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of a Scandinavian movie, a few years ago I called my mother. The film highlighted a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden in World War II. The family's wife, who took him in, asked for a girl because she (as it turns out) lost her daughter. Instead of a boy, she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates matters even more. I highly recommend the movie to anyone who has had a good night out. Tom, it has the same feeling.
