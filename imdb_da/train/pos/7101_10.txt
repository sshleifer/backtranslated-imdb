Unlike popular belief, this title, to me at least, is not that bad. Actually. I consider it a favorite movie of all time. Welding of stories was not structured too well when considering the differences between the series, but despite all this one can see it quite happily. For a movie in its time, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently credible. <br /> <br /> The sound / soundtrack is a personal favorite of mine. Almost everything has a proper sound effect, and many of the voices fit the characters much better than their now cast American dub counterparts. The synchronization is perfect in every shot. I had a few problems with the cast for 'foreign' voices (please forgive the raw name it has been a while since I have seen it). Otherwise, it seemed that the throw was perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters in this movie. Dubs are often a topic I rarely agree with so long ago. I loved the OSDs from then, but the casts often let down series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that this was one of the first anime I saw in my life. It has historical value to me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it remained stronger and more seen in my collection. <br /> <br /> In my knowledge, the title only made it to the United States in Texas. Personally, I think it's a big shame. Had the right audience been subject to it, I think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not spoiled over the years. I am involved in anime every day of my life and everyone I have shown this movie thought it was a neatly composed title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components, the viewer can see the clear plot holes between shows. But without seeing the originals, one viewer would not really notice. Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it again in its time. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Carl had the balls in order to at least push the genre. I think Harmony wouldn't put cash into the series to be published. Despite the few discerning mistakes people have had with this movie, the 80s are the feeling of being in love. If you see Megazone 23 now, for the original Japanese sound or the new dub, I think you will be very disappointed with the OSD. Return your thoughts to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine new 80's sound to E.V.E. <br /> <br /> says all this. The film's popularity today is most likely down to its rarity in the open market. Personally, it created a collection for me. I now blame the world for goods from the three components that have made it, and if I ever meet with Carl Macek, he shakes his hand for the effort and buys him a pint or a box to make me anime.
