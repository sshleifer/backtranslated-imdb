I watched this movie at True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (of which there is little), but because in fact, despite what people say, I thought the movie was correct in the depiction of teens dealing with pregnancy. It is NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, cool witty characters that roar through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and they act like children would. <br /> <br /> They are dumb, awkward and annoyingly confused at all. Yes, it could be accidental, and they could just be bad actors, but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when he's not trying to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved him for that. Patricia Arquette is whiny and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenager? The combination of the two is not just lavender on your pillow. The reason was very predictable and but what then? I believed in them, his stress and the inability to cope - her brave but slightly misunderstood attempt to bring them closer. I think the characters traded by someone else would have been annoying and incredible, but they weren't. It reflects the surrealist in the situation they are in that he is in the class and she goes to campus with the child. I felt sorry for it, I felt angry with him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> Finally, I loved it and would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
