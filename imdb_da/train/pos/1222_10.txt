I ate this card on a DVD of best New Zealand shorts, all great but the French doors were amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if something happens. Just as you relax in the drum in the home renovation, the most scary happens. <br /> <br /> I wanted to stop seeing EEEEkkk, but I was glued. <br /> <br /> The films fall into the primary fear of darkness and with little, if any, special effects. It just cools you to the leg. A simple but brilliant concept opened all these reminders when I was young and dreamed the most unlikely but scary situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of filmmakers is turned on and the protagonist takes you convincingly through history. It is a quality card that I have not seen for some time. <br /> <br /> The French doors have all the features of a great feature, unfortunately it ends in ten minutes or so. Nevertheless, a great end that asks you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> Loved it and well done and thanks for the trip. These New Zealanders really show the talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
