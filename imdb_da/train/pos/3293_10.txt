If I was ever asked to remember a song from a film of yesteryear, it should be "Chalo Di Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention cinema photography when sailboat goes out against the black background and shining stars. The other was to be "Chalte Chalte." Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before she died, and the amount of time it took was seen on the screen. In each of the songs depicted, she looks young, but after that she does not. But an actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who fell in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally entered his train cabin, and when he saw them, he left a note that describes how beautiful they are. Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story, if at all possible, should be seen on the big screen, just for the cinema's photography and songs. The movie stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi's grandchildren have now begun to revive their grandfather's studio by making a comedy film.
