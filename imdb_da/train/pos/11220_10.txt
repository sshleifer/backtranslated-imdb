The goal for the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that has been classically written all over. I absolutely loved this series, and to this day it's still my favorite anime. And even though it wasn't Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Essentially, as a parody of the 1970s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Popper Gunbuster started up steam as a serious drama towards the end of episode 2 when Noriko Takaya is forced to reviving his father's father's death, which was killed in humanity's first encounter with insect race Humanity is at war. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence turns out to get in the way at times and she falls. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, has even doubts that Noriko is being chosen as a pilot. But Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds in becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle where Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian fighting pilot awarded with squadron Noriko and Kazumi belonging to the Smith Tower, a love interest for Noriko killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko is also interested as Kimiko is still on the ground to live a normal life while Noriko is out in space. And because of the time extension, Kimiko is usually on the ground, while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18, while Kimiko is in the mid-fifties. <br /> All in all, this is an excellent anime series to see if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's art, give this chance a try. It will grow on you.
