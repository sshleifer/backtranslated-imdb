I know some people that the movie is boring, but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the movie and thought that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery caught his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the details of the lives of others, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what's more fascinating than anyone, so fortunately reinvent itself? "Men become what they dream - you've dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I would also mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out for me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in several movies.
