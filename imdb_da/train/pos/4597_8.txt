After gaining fame with the Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was again drawn into the spotlight with the 1983 project A, a very fun pirate girl who restored him as a great star. At the time of the Police Story being released two years later, the extraordinary hype around Jackie reached his pitch, and the crowds flocked to see this frenetic mix of amazing stunts, brutal fighting scenes, and questionable comedy. It broke several cash office premises and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but seen 20 years on - is it any good? As an action movie Police History is undoubtedly up. There are several fantastic battle scenes, some stuntwork reminiscent of the very best of Chan's hero Buster Keaton, and a compelling whose violent climatic threat. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and while the frequent forays in labored comedy boil the movie's influence just a little, his charisma carries it through. By presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath, whose recklessness puts others at risk, Jackie took a huge gamble ... though it does not seem to have noticed! War critics boasted political history as a simple 'good vs. evil' critics, and it was hardly the brothers Karamazov who showed such uncertainty, but the film was nevertheless a remarkable and commendable shift from conventional ideas. <Br /> In short, this remains a quality "popcorn" movie * (though you might empty your stomach as many villains are bumped or deposited in the glass screenings of the movie's last scene) - a powerful, entertaining, entertaining action movie that goes the best of its time.
