This is a very bleak, hard-hitting, even brutal movie about a death pause that goes wrong. It's black and white photography that keeps it from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted but oddly sympathetic leader. One of the first films to imagine the psychological destruction of the series of deaths. It is also quite exciting.
