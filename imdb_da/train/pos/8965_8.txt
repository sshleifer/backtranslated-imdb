Made in the same year as "Vertigo", it is an equally breathtaking movie, but in a much lighter friend. It's in an enchanted New York in the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who throws a spell over James Stewart, but gets caught instead. The interesting side light is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who comes from Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part Novak would make famous on film).
