This movie is amazing. Of course, if you take it too seriously, you will hate it; But it is the amount of "dudes" and "right ons" brings laughter and faint memories about 15 years ago. I like its ability to make me simply chuckle by obvious jokes and silliness, and its ability to make me see its predecessor, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes, and completely mature humor, don't look at it; But if you want a movie that is humorous and stupid, yet intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. In fact, I wish more of this kind of picture appeared in today's theaters. And hey, it is Keanu Reeves who acts as everyone parodying him as a play ... right ... doesn't get much better than that :)
