For those who have not followed the Anne Marie Fahey Murder case. You miss one of the coolest but complicated murders at all. The murderer is the popular Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano, and the victim is the Delaware Governor's Scheduling Secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he just didn't want to let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini-series. While the actress playing Mrs Fahey does a good job, she doesn't have her dark long hair. His other mistress is certainly more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and makes an Emmy award winning performance like Tom Capano. It would be better with the actual Delaware and Philadelphia locations. With Ann Rules executive production, she adds accuracy to Anne Marie's organizational characteristics and her personal struggle with an eating disorder. These types of information can be overlooked by any other executive or director. If you haven't read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played Ann Rules former friend and subject, Ted Bundy in another book adaptation many years ago. He was brilliant now and then. He does an above average job with a great story. Even President Clinton offered his help in the Anne Marie Fahey case. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now the US Senator for Delaware, who defeated the long-standing, popular consultant Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. If you don't think the movie is interesting, read the rule book.
