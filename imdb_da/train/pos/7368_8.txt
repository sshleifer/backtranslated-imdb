I think the team behind this movie did a very good job with the limitations they had. Only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit everything, which I think is a feat in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homosexuality involved in the story), I think this movie is a heartbreaking tragedy and the more involved you get in the story, the more sad You feel. More in the direction of Heaton because of the love he feels, but not returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies that I enjoyed a lot and wanted to see again. I think it's a shame that is movie, not very well heard of at all.
