Have not seen this 1958 movie for a very long time and have enjoyed Kim Novak to play the role of Gil Holroyd, who is an actual witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd, who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock at name Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian puts her eyes on Shep Henderson (James Stewart) who is engaged to a girl, he marries Gillian performers some magic magic with a cat and changes his intended bride and becomes so bright and falls in love with Gillian . The story tells that a real witch can't fall in love, blush or cry, and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided to do something about this situation. Amazing movie to watch over and over and a great classic movie from 1958.
