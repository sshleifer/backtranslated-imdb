Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular magazine Sharpe in the hope of living his dream lifestyle but struggling to create a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on American Business Survival, this comedy received drama mixed outlook from criticism. The brand as inconsistent fun but with the charm of the actors how to lose friends, seemed to be a run of the mill fish out of the pond making it fun by another culture comedy, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 image works because of its actors and the simple but sharp story. We start in the past, then in the present, and work our way forward to see how Young made his mark at one of America's top magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too sympathetic to words. Whether it hits zombies with a cricket bat or shows his sidekick the nature of the law, the English actor brings a charm and light heart to any scene. Here, when scripting is good, but far from his own standards, he brings a lot of energy to the picture, and he is alone worth looking at. His antics with "Babe 3" are unforgettable, simply breathtaking things as it is his exaggerated dance, but he pulls it off brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson are good at portraying the stereotype magazine bosses where Dunst fits nicely into the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can shop here with a fun hyperbole of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as ridiculous as her character sights in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg rounds it in real Brit-style comedy with a good little twist. Though a British movie there is an adaptation of the American lifestyle of Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to narration. Young wants the lower court dirty as opposed to American professionalism. The inclusion of modern tabloid stars will soon make this movie dated, but the concept of exploitation of movie star gives this edge. Weide's first picture is not perfect. There are drains in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many signs needed. The physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a side note, the flourishing on the DVD is some of the finest you will ever see, which is almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama has Simon Pegg's shining form again and with the collective approach of storytelling and sharp comedy, it's worth seeing.
