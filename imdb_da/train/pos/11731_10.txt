I think this movie is a lot of fun and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It's a pity that the second part of this wonderful movie was not successful because it was a lot of fun as a first part. I also regret that besides this movie I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she's a great actress with great potential. I hope I will see her in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventure. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. What more can I add? This is cool and classic movie!
