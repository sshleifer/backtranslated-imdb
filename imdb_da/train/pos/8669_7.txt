If you, unlike some of the comments here, do not conduct a class war and do not mind seeing the lives of other people who are quite successful, outgoing, bohemian (gasp) and not being terribly English at a party and getting into all sorts of problems as a result, this is not a bad movie, closer to the Euro cinema than an imitation of the usual slender American crap ... I think the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a deliberate decision rather than bad movie production, I I defend it the film is not worse as a result, and it focuses on cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie - think it's her name, since the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) an exception is David Baddiel, who must never be allowed to get into serious things !! It's easy, and we're not going for this kind of anatomical relationship in this country, but if you don't have any real friends to party with than you could do worse than sit and watch this.
