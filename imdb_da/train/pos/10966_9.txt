Gray Gardens is a world of its own. Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation, eat ice cream and liver pate in a delayed kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. Cat lollies while mother Edith insults her daughter's elokution. This is a Tennessee Williams game that comes to life and should inspire writers and dramatists as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% genuine. The situation in the house reminds me of how my grandmother and her 50-These daughter lived for a decade (except that they were poor and clean). They wanted to bend all day, grandmother talked about her glorious past, while her daughter blamed her for missing opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-see for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship of this kind. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did a great job of getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so ruthlessly. It is rare to see true life in this way and, more particularly, in the context of the remains - the remains of a strong family that fall into the skeleton of their own mansion.
