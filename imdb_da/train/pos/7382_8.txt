My brief comment on this flick is to pick it up. Chances are, you will be pleasantly surprised by a number of elements explored superbly in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing into space in every possible way, will not push your nerves to the edge ... 2 thumbs up!
