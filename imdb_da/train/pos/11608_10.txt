This is a great movie. From reading other reviews I can see that I am not the only one throwing a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and belief, she made the ending cordial and memorable. In the hands of a small actress, her last scene would have been tired and corny. One would never guess this movie was made on a tight, limited budget. The cinematography is beautiful and there are a number of big name actors. The scripture is so wonderful I can see why they all wanted to be in it. If you see the long long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii is hospitalized to make this movie happen and for good reason. The audio track (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost didn't want the movie to end.
