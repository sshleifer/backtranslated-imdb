Police Story is a great series of pieces for Jackie Chan to show off his unique talents and brave. Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous whole mall fight finals are probably Jackie's greatest single-fight sequence, more brutal and less comical, so says Project A or the Drunken Master at the end of the fight, you can almost feel the pain of the impact. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not meet this quality, as it is a rather formal cop thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in movies like Project A, where his natural comic talents shine through. In the serious limitations of some elements of the Police Story, it just doesn't work for me. That said, this is still up there with Jackie's best movie because of the incredible stunt work and pure acting. As usual with Hong Kong movies, you avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is really terrible to stick with the subtitles. Big stunts, OK movie is a good starting point if you haven't seen a JC movie before and it is worth looking at any movie fan 7/10
