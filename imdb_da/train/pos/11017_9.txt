This movie turned out to be better than the average action movie and in that respect succeeded. This movie had spectacular filmography with spectacular mountain lakes and heights, a very suitable Stallone, which also gives a good performance, an exciting plot and great performance from its biggest villain, because he really wants to shock you with his evil ways. The movie is not a good time because of the weak play. The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special man, like Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters. They chose to humanize Stallone character in this, which is ok, but considering the style of the plot, the voltage factor weakens. The dialogue was also cheesy and carelessly discouraging. The script should have been more realistic and less talky. Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. The filmmakers should have been more careful about how they fetched the shooting effects and missed. They should have continued the quality of the scenes in the shoot sequences during the plane hijacking early in the film. Instead, they decided to destroy many of the shooting sequences (ala "A-Team" TV series) as soon as the bad guys set foot on the mountain tops.This movie had a lot of potential all the time. Crises action sequences, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky style feelings / determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level. I know this was not Stallone's fault. In the upscale film's director wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction, which was not so great, if not for his film photographer. Put a good movie though ........
