One has a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Of course SOB is very nice, charming, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Seeing Jean Pierre Leaud's character in the workplace is like seeing what's going on in real life when guys in that way destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic, and you know she's going to end up with a lot of pain, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty. A look throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he believes will get the reaction he wants. <br /> <br /> The scene two hours in, when Leaud and Lebrun have loved themselves, and the next morning he puts on record and, very sweet and charming, sings together to entertain her is brilliant. "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" expression blinking back and forth over her face will be in my memory for a long time to come. It's a long movie, but watch it all at once, preferably in a movie theater. It takes a while to get in, but then the time just disappears.
