The Korean War has been called America's Forgotten War. So many unanswered questions were buried with the 50,000 men who died there. Occasionally we are treated to a game or movie that deals with the colored, ghost-frozen cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the finest. It's called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), selected for a top secret mission by his commander. His job is to defeat the North Koreans and offer his services to UN forces. So successful is his cover, he proves invaluable to the enemy and is given rank by Major. However, he is then captured by the Americans, put to the test as a traitor and spy. He announced that he was ordered to be defective, and unfortunately he learned that his commander had been killed and had no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He is doomed and doomed to hang. But his conviction is doubted by Capt. Young (Bradford Dillman), his accuser. Convincing Commander Gen. Amos Baily, (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he gets a new test and if he is found guilty will be executed. The courtroom drama is top notch, which is cast as includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was far away, but the possibility of judging a communist and hanging him hit very close to the home in the 1950s. Because of its superior script and powerful message, this drama has become a classic courtroom. Excellent view and recommended to everyone. ****
