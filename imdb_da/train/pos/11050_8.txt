Now magic works in mysterious ways. This movie of 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of magic, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was an amazing occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of excitement. Although it had something of a theater game (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was very effective. In the tradition of "Cube" you felt trapped with the characters, and even though they were criminals, you developed a lot of sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind by the terms the story takes. Some events caught you and there was always a hint of insanity in the air. Quite intense and entertaining and as I didn't expect anything (a friend rented it) it was a positive surprise!
