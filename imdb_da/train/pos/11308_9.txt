TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they keep coming up with movies I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very early movie of Visconti !! ... wow ... the Italian version of The Postman always rings twice ... brilliant !! beautifully acted and headed ... never heard of either the leaders who were excellent, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His appearance was ahead of his time ... many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a great worldwide star !! The movie is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and smaller glossaries than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remember the white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different end ... see it see ... I am going to buy it !!
