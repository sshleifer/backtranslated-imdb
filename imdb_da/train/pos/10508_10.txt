Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore everything he wants. He can just wander around, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels and much more. You can spend four hours at one level. No time constraints. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors that you need a certain number of stars to enter. When you enter these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight with Bowser at the end stage. To get to certain worlds you need a number of stars to enter. You enter the world by going through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many gameplay games, I can't see how anyone liked this game. It is well. This launch title is the game that assured players that the N64 would have a good life. Every 3D Platform game we know of has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of the 3D game. 10 out of 10. If you have a N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used because no one sells this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
