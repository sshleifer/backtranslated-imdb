Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and Furious. You could tell she was a hard woman. With this movie she has not only proven her action but shows no fear and is tough as she should be in this movie. She's more of a bad girl, and that's what I like about her. This film is about a restless girl who lives life as an empty boy and is constantly in trouble with school and family. As she becomes interested in her brothers training to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and ask her brothers to train her. Although they do not believe they have the potential, they are shown to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a little slow at the end but was well done. It shows that people can do something, even if they do not believe you have the potential. I recommend being seen.
