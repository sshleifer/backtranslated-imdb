Three flashbacks introduce the protagonists (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; Three are the songs, each of which is associated with the same characters. Three times, Ahmad pronounces the absolute word 'Time' in his declaration of love for the princess who answers her three questions at their first of three meetings. So strongly is the impression he causes that the princess will resist Jaffar's three attempts to conquer her - by three consecutive ploys: fraud, hypnosis and memory deletion. Yet Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inevitable instruments of dominance over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three are the number of flying units: the mechanical horse, the genius and the genius and the magic carpet. The pleasure offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three meetings; Three times, genius laughs high in the canyons, and three are his considerations of human fragility before he departs. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Dawn Temple (armed guards, giant spider, and giant squid). Three are the instruments of justice: the magic eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess and the bow and arrow to perform Jaffar. There is magic in number three and there is magic in this movie.
