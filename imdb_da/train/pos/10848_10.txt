... Heads, hands and feet - a band of the past, like strange fruit. A triple whammy there. Those who have blamed not to like this movie are either heartless or under 40 and have not had any experience with the right thing. Sad for them. This is a painfully well-observed little picture that is an excellent way to pass an hour or two, and will probably not even fade much on the other view. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways the most lovely figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn to super performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a great deal the eyes go with a sharp actor like Karen, who tries to keep the band together as the spectacular self-destructors. <br /> <br /> South Barrett / Brian Wilson echo is loud and clear, Mott the Hoople backs up before one in all their bloated ridicule, and the manuscript is never more than a minute. Don't compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair to them all. The closest comparison is The Commitments, and that's not bad. And any movie that can evoke memories of the Blood Wine Pig - a band I can't remember ever seeing, but the name goes on - well, it shows that someone in the team knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> A little joy and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have another - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-and what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... ten inch nails anybody? (You must watch the movie or have been on the road)
