"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and the white are always present in our lives. Mel Brook's performance is brilliant as always, and the work of the other actors is also fine. This movie has some Capra flavor, so that's good. There are some unforgettable gags like the one when Brooks tries to make some money dancing in the street and all the people who walk past just ignore him or when he meets a funny, crazy man who believes is Paul Getty and then begin to argue and relax each other. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you've missed. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the ancient and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality does not. Yes, life stinks.
