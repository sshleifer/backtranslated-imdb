Someone releases this movie on DVD so that it can take its sacred place as if the biggest movies all the time in ten to twenty years, where critics and film historians look back on the so-called movies of the 1990s and see how vapid they were for it most, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and revive the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europe" as it is referred to outside the United States) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of gloom and almost psychotic uncertainty that excluded from post WWII Europe, the decimated German landscape whose physical horrors were only matched by the damage to people's psyche. Von Trier clearly paints his vision on the screen. You will feel that you see some lost espionage noir classics from the late 1940s with the perfectly bright black and white scenes while at the same time feeling you are on the brink of something without front, especially in scenes like the murder on board the train. Literally, in this movie, you see that you are developing an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason Von Trier was caught in his own Dogma movement shortly afterwards. And even though his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classics by themselves, it is with "Zentropa" that he really lifted the movie production's art to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a fine wine and ask for a dvd release.
