The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of movies, and not to mention some of the disappointments in these comebacks that I was woe to find a movie I could just sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to read further down the page (there are no spoilers), I'll summarize this: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some dubious violent parts, lots of death and A handful of scenes with little blood, not for small children, but are not trying to be too big or to exceed its limits. Think of it as a little more serious, a little more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be as strange a movie as others ... Maybe once or twice a month if I feel active I am also a great Sci-Fi / Fantasy fan. I'm bored of restored repeating story lines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the diamond in ru. <br /> <br /> In the end here (August), I was tired of broken expectations from the big hits that I declined to see the Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Having had my hopes thoroughly confused by Transformers for my fiction addiction, the previews of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly cautious. <br /> <br /> So many others here I was totally surprised. I was going to see another generic fantasy film clich√© from here for breakfast. Don't be fooled, it's definitely an adventure and it actually has witches, magic and requires complete suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing I found is that it's not based on anything I "I have seen or read in the last 15 years, and it is actually a really good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other movies that seem to stay again as thorns on a page, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year , and in two years the movie would be like another "epic fantasy tale, like LotR and the rest," says NYT and such and such no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust didn't get me bolted to my place on due to paper jams in each turn, and I didn't sweat bullets due to plot hook for plot hook that threatened to tear dramatically apart and echo through the theater in a tall boom. It didn't even use huge volumes to get my attention on what is happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). It does not attempt to showcase the latest CGI techniques, nor has it offended my intelligence with crafted dialogues and stories that are simple enough, I could have figured out in 3rd grade (boy I hate them). <br /> <br /> I've just seen. Looked and enjoyed a refreshing creative story unfolding to my eyes. Sure, I may have known what would happen most of the movie, but it forgot about it. It even made my heart force on some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater, feeling better than when I went in. It really is a gem. After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and movies that were less than my expectations, it was like a cold sweet cup of tea to pay tribute to all the hard work I had done sitting through the others trying to get out Of those with my money are worth it. <br /> <br /> It is probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that are only tested by time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you really should watch this movie. This little diamond finds its way into my DVD collection, the moment it hits stores you can trust me on this. Just wonderful.
