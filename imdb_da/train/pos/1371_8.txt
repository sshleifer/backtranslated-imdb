This movie is a nice, light-hearted look on both sides of where the "club kid" rave scene blends with New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo of the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is the "Torch Song Trilogy" for perky-post-teen girls. "The girl" for our confused, hit millennia. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is fast and fun, and Parker Posey's customer deserves - if not an academic award - a "wave" of kudos. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Posey and she is the perfect cast. Like much of her acting, it can't be very deep, it's often self-referring and good, posey ... but it all works. She is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this movie entertains, she wears it on her shoulders as a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it fall to the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial party fashionista who is not about to steal designer clothes from a friend's closet or get out with someone else's boyfriend. At a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are carefree in every sense of the word, including other people; And the process of learning the care is necessary for life. The scripture is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance disappointing is the aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavily handed down; a more nuanced performance from her would have immersed the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... it's comedy. A surprisingly deep role that gives this movie some fabric and worldview is the false selling boyfriend. We should all be so lucky ... is he for Mary? or the one coming away? <br /> <br /> I consider this to be an 8 because it's not a good moment with movie history, it's not a classic, and it's not great art (which everyone gets deeper and richer to see again). Like "Desperately Seeking Susan", it represents something very true about its time period, but may become irrelevant over time. Still, it has everything an entertaining movie needs, and it's worth seeing several times on the clothes alone!
