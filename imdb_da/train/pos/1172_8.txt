And another round of South Park comes to an end. It wasn't as much an episode as I had hoped for, but Night of Living Homeless was a stronger finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. It still can't keep a light on Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> The living homeless's night is a spoof of the Zombergren, done in a way that only South Park would believe. Instead of meat eating zombies, the units are homeless, the request changes and seems to survive away from it. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the Community Center but this time on the roof where they can investigate the scene. A particularly fun moment is when a member finds out that his home is gone and becomes homeless, leaving Randy nothing but shooting him. Meanwhile, the four boys have set themselves to solve the problem of the whole story behind the homeless take-over trying to convey a message but to be seriously uninspired. South Park is the best many times when it is ridiculous. Matt and Trey played it safely this week and did not criticize the homeless problem, they just managed to sound. <br /> <br /> The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless. This is the first time a suicide on South Park goes wrong and we see the poor man missing his brain and trying to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies. Another inspired South Park moment. In general, the episode was fun, but it was being kept amazing by holding back some real commentary on the homeless and jumping with zombie shtick. The end is something fun, but nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for the next series of episodes. It's a long haul, but South Park needs to be applauded because it's running. The show seemed to run out of steam last season, but now it's back in full shape.
