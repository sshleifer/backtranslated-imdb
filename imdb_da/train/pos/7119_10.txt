My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (right Major, US Marine Corps) was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to Japanese and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to know that my father was the technical advisor for this movie, and I hope he had an impact on the movie when it looked like it really was when I read in various comments written by viewers of this movie that it seemed like real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures and has always wanted things to be seen as they were so I would like to think that he had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically she is Japanese) and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest emperors from the emperor in Japan for his contributions and activities to bring Kendo and Iaido back to Japan when McArthur banned them after World War II. <br /> <br /> My dad was once a marine, but I know that when you are a marine, you are always a marine. And that's exactly what he is and I love and respect him a lot. <br /> <br /> I would love to watch this movie if someone wants to get a copy of it. And I would like to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
