This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was fun, fun and I love what it is about the holiday season. It has me totally in the mood for Santa Claus and listening to holiday music. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will be the place for Christmas holidays in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to make me feel the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think it just adds the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas gift with a love cut. I enjoyed it. No, it's not the Titanic, and it won't make your heart pound with expectation, but it will cause a laugh or two. So go laugh and have a good time :)
