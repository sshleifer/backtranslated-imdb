I watched this movie when I was 13 and I really liked dana plato, who later starred in various kinds as kimberly drummond. I don't think it's garbage. Nor was it supposed to be a successor to the documentary. It's just a cute kids movie about 3 kids who go after men trying to find the creepy creek monster. the men get hurt and the children save them with the help of the creature. Sharp shots of Arkansas swamp and nature were neat. this is a good movie for children, no real violence a few scary but good fun for the young children.
