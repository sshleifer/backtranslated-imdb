This picture for me scores very high as it is a very fun and fun spear of Alien Invaders who take over a city and many of its' peoples. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are all adorned in the black of the 1950s style and the whole movie has a deliberately sticky and kitschy feel to it. Some of the scenes are fun as the birth of a foreign being. All the actors provide full-blooded and serious performances that make the movie even more fun, and the special effects and foreigners at least seem to be intentionally third rate to add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> These types of movies often deserve a cult following: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
