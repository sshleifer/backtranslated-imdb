Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I've been looking wherever I find these two movies and I can't find them anywhere in my local area. (I'm Australian). Can you please help me and tell me where to buy it. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie wen I was 5 and it is still right now when I am a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except my younger sister because I've seen it so many times that she's sick. I love this movie and I can't wait to buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
