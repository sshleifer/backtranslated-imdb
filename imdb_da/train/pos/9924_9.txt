Ah, Domino is actually a fresh breath, something new for the cinema world. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I have seen some complaints about the camera's work, and actually, according to the creators themselves, the flashy and wild shots were the culmination of mistakes throughout time. All you see was the desired effect. Maybe some complaints because something like this has never been done before, even if that's what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, what you see is how Domino sees things through the eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, I don't see anything bad about it. Despite it being "messy" in nature, according to some, it is actually just a quick form of narration. The reason is really not everything that is hard to follow if you actually focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see movies from many different aspects like the play, the plot, etc. I'm no "interpreter" or something that chooses movies from each other, it just comes to me. That being said, I think this is a really good movie, despite its future as a cult classic, blockbuster or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, yes, there is no doubt how varied the cast is. I think the cast is excellent as they all do good jobs that depict their characters effectively, that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you see a small piece of each and every one of their lives and put them further apart. Basically, I personally loved the cast and characters. Anyone who bashes and burns this movie may not see it as I do or it does not appeal to them. No matter, it's a great movie in itself, no, it's a great movie season.
