Absolutely one of the smallest of Astaire / Rogers musicals. It's just very badly plotted and paced. It only runs a few minutes longer than Swing Time, for example, but it feels a lot much longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely ever interesting. I like Hilliard. She is cute, and I love at least one of her songs: "But where are you?" ("Get behind me Satan", her second number, is a weak residue from Top Hat, fortunately cut from the masterpiece). Follow the fleet would actually be a bad movie if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition climbs to the top of any of their numbers. The dance is just amazing. "I put all my eggs in a basket" presents the two exercises a dance that they have not completely perfected yet. Its imperfections make it more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So the movie is worth looking at its amazing moments.
