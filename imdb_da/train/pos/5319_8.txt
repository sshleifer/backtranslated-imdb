Forget this is a "B" movie. Forget it is obsolete in many ways. Instead, writer director Ida Lupino gives very deserving credit to address a topic that at that time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. In my opinion, this was the first film to combat rape and the emotional and mental effects that this crime has on its victims. Although much of the cast's performance is at best pedestrian, Mala Powers, who was then eighteen or nineteen, has an excellent performance throughout the traumatized young woman, Ann, who tries to run away from her "shame". Based on her work in this movie, I'm surprised she didn't have a more successful play. Also, Tod Andrews has some nice moments like the minister who reaches out to help her. <br /> <br /> Ms Lupino, of course working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes that the persecution through the streets and the alleys leads to rape, and the police force follows it. And she created a bittersweet ending that left me wondering if Ann really could ever get a normal life again.
