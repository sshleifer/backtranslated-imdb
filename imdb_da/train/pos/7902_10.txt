The film is unique in homosexual iconography and extends this beyond the aesthetics of music and cast. Throughout the film there exists a childlike marvel as seen through the main character's eyes. Her light heart takes the world around us is comical and beautiful. In a way, it's a girls' slacker movie. Watch this, you want a relaxing, entertaining midnight movie. Buy this if you like different, take the world of media and love together (?).
