I was speechless and ruined after my first show of this - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very fun and incredibly surreal - documentary if not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the Weirdsville competitions. I focused on how these women (who are clinically far above eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising ways, and I wonder if their withdrawals from the world were caused by something beyond the accuracy of life in the unreal blueberry universe. perhaps some abuse or perhaps just a touch of trait and rebellion that sprouted out of their control and took over their own life. This can be one of the biggest movies that come dangerously close to exploitation without going over the edge - as Edies does their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the bricked bedroom, cats urinating on bed, Racoons coming from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - as a child's birthday party went seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and looking out - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
