Kell's Secret is one of the most unique, beautiful and eye-popping animated movies I've ever seen. Before I watched this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up on his money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious competitor. <br /> <br /> The secret to Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Abbot of Kell. The Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too strict and much more concerned about consolidating the wall around the city from an upcoming attack from Vikings than he is caring for the boy's imagination. When legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) up and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely snowmobile named Aisling who enjoys him (and saves his life more than one time). With Aisling's help, he tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mysterious book that the legend has it can become dark in light.
