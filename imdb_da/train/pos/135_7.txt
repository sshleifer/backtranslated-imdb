It was an excellent piece for the puppet series, because this movie showed the whole series from one to seven. And it was about a woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I had never guessed that the puppets would have pain. Plus it showed some of the puppet show, which I didn't see and I saw what I saw as much as part two. It showed a look of torch that can turn things and people, which is tough and showed the return of the puppet master from part 1. It also showed small foreigners from part 4 who were also cool, it showed other episodes that could be good for them, and it did. So thanks to this puppet master it will be a big hit.
