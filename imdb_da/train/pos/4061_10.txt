This is the best dub I've ever heard at Disney, as well as the best fit since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This one has both hero and heroine (although I do not really support the use of hero and heroine here as Miyazaki is out of stereotype and common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, surprised by Mononoke, alarmed by the Firefly's Tombs, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this one begins with a little doubt in my part. Wonder if this will be the first Ghibis dud. Well in the end just like in Kun yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 ratings. I would rate 9.8, but the extra 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. SPOILS Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if humanity really cannot live with too much power. The coinciding scene gave me patches of the Metropolis ending. It's just sad in some way. The reason is evident in most reviews and soundtrack rules as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a prolonged moment of astonishing composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling movie that was previously part of American cinema in the classic days (it's a wonderful life, etc., etc.). Well, things are changing ....
