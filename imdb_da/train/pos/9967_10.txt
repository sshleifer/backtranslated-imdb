There are some things I will never understand; why underwear comes in packages of three when it is clear that not enough is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this movie and it is brilliant. If you approach this movie, expecting a real movie, you might as well approach Satan who expects a hug; although it may be possible if you greet the satanic characters of the movie. Take e.g. Pitch The most ineffective, camp, unhellish depiction of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep teamed up to create a ten foot Satan costume from red body paint and horns covered in condoms. However, it creates some of the most hilarious moments in any movie ever. Seriously, there is no understatement. The same can be applied to all other characters, carrying the little girl who seems so sickly innocent that she probably overcompensates for a serious crime she's a part of. Then again, if Santa's inter-space recon station is real, there is no chance she could have avoided him for so long. Simply, if you haven't seen this movie, you can't consider yourself a serious buff. The extremely fun characterization, action, concept and almost-under-radar racism make this a must see over any movie to date (if you're after pure laughter there).
