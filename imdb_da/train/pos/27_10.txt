Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo I've ever seen and blends all the necessary elements into a creepy stew. First and foremost, for me, it has a complex, twisted plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come out of the left field at the end. The story of a series of horrific murders (you already know how many from the movie's title, right?), Taking place in apparent fulfillment of an old prophecy of two sisters, is one involved, and the killer, a red-dressed figure with the crazy laugh of A madwoman is both scary and memorable. Every great giallo requires some lovely pre-actresses, and here we have a whole assortment led by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her former roles, Sybil Danning, as a merry tramp in barbaras fashion house. Another necessary ingredient in a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and Bruno Nicolai gives one to this movie that should be with you for days. Beautiful landscape? Check again. Filmed largely in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the picture is a treat for the eye. OK, OK, but what about those murders? After all, that's not what gialli is about? I am pleased to report that most viewers should be well pleased with the various knifes, shootings, impalements and other carnations that this movie tastefully addresses ... not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and Masser of them too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the mandatory red herring and, in Ugo Pagliai's person, a hunky leading man to the female viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from the fine people at No Shame and you know what it means: a beautiful print and lots of extras to boot! Thanks guys!
