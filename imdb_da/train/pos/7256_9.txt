I saw the long day of dying when it first came out to the cinema, I thought the movie gave a good soldier's point of view, it gave a realistic account of men in war. The story moves at a good pace and shows a group of men behind enemy lines and tries to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role of conviction, as Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) was surprised that I couldn't find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten movie that is sad as it is superior to many other war movies I've seen.
