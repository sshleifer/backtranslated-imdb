I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon television in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope from transmitters separated into lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation. I'm not sure squares with facts. <br /> <br /> The movie is still well done. The German High Command reports violently without emotion "The Russians descend on Fredrich Strasse" as if everything was in accordance with the plan. It was my impression that this film and a later American made for television knock-off were based on the British historian Trevor-Roper's account with a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree with the latest German movie on the topic DOWNFALL was as good as the classic. The American knock-off was a little flat. <br /> <br /> Few characters have attracted so much attention from the cinema as Adolph. Still, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever talked about Hitler's double to pass in John Toland's magnificent historic piece. Was gibs?
