Budget constraints, time constraints, shoot a script and then cut it, cut it, cut it ... This crew is a group of good young filmmakers; thoughtful in this script - yes, allegorical - clever in zero-dollar effects, when time and knowledge are all you have, rely on actors and friends and kind others for their time, affection, rankings; and get a first function in the can, a 1-in-1000 thing. These guys are making movies. Excellent. Check out their shorts collection "Heartland Horrors" and see the developments. And I can guarantee that working with them is about the most fun thing you want to do in the industry. I am stymied by harsh, abusive criticism for this movie and wondering if a reviewer even heard a word of dialogue, contemplating a thought or concept, or if all that was the desire for this work was the visual make of bashing and slashing to satisfy some thoughtless view of what horror should mean to an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" bring you to you. Don't explain what you expect it to be just because it is put into the horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural premise. It is a drama with depth beyond how far you can hold a knife in a person with reverence for a message that does not attack the brain's vision center, but rather draws on its empathic imagination to experience the suffering of others in mind and spirit. Mark ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
