I've seen the movie Holes and say it should be the best movie all year round. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean who would come up with the idea of ​​having cumbersome boys digging holes like their punishment? Louis Sachar, who's who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley should be the largest there. Weight and height, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and the armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray / Rex should be one of the smallest boys, but it wasn't. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that flashbacks were quite convincing and long. I'd rather have seen more of the present than the past, but that's just my opinion. However, I especially like the boys' work. As Squid / Alan was played by Jake M.Smith should be a mood and hard child. Jake M.Smith did just that and did a good job on what made almost all the players in Holes. So I would say if you haven't seen Holes yet, then you should definitely see it when it comes out again, or you will miss out on a whole lot of fun.
