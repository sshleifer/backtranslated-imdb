As the musicians have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to do without all the talent needed to make a contract during a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real story about Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio was trying the missions before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done what I doubt if it will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been happy with how his song was portrayed on the screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> Saying that liberties were taken with their lives is to be modest. Caruso, as the man who portrayed him, was a man of great appetites although with much more self-discipline. He had many relationships with several women and gave birth to two unskilled sons who are not in this movie. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is being considered almost an afterthought. He is shown in a recording studio late in his life. In fact, he began recording around the turn of the century, and along with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor, the recording industry got what it was. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights, you almost had to inherit a ticket to see one of them perform live. But many immigrants Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of one of these men. That's why both became legends, they are. <br /> <br /> What the movie has is some beautifully staged operating arias performed by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have been if he had the discipline of a Caruso to adhere to opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the movie with an RCA Red Seal album with songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not get a current cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna as well. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza had a great hit recording The Loved Night of the Year, further helping popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life with Enrico Caruso, this is not the case. If you're looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, don't miss The Great Caruso.
