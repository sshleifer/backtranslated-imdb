I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would have missed this movie if I hadn't chosen Air Canada. Looking at a small screen at the back of the front seat, I found this captivating and fascinating. I was driving in a couple of places and had to jump back, but I had to see until it was over. Now I look forward to the DVD release in Europe, even though I get just as transfixed when I can leave the door, have not yet been discovered! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is amazing, and that movie gives so much insight and 'fills in' the story the photographs tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
