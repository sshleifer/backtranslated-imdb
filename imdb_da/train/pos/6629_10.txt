The best Treasure Island ever made. They just don't make movies here or ever. No one makes movies like this. More <br /> <br /> Another novelty, this movie is fun, honest and fascinating, but moody, <br /> <br /> mysterious and morose. This is one of my favorite photos. <br /> <br /> The director should have had a clue as to what it's all about, but he certainly <br /> <br /> leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations while leaving only a little back to imagination. Why he <br /> <br /> hasn't made more movies like this, I have no idea. While <br /> <br /> reminds me of some of the best noirs, it's one of a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not too lazy or simple.
