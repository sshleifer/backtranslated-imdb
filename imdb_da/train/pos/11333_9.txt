Just kidding about the weight loss; Well, you can lose yourself, you never know. Anyway, what can I say I love this movie. It has the same sense of youth and innocence found in movies like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us of what it is like to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magical, mysterious and horror they perceive. Jake's Closet presents a story that is unique to man in his compassion that anyone who has childhood can both relate to and fall in love with. See it with friends; see it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional.
