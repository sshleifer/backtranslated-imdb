I just watched the movie, I was afraid it would disappoint me. However, I was pretty surprised at the end. The American cake franchise is still in my favorite franchise movie from all times. yes it will not be true if i say i enjoyed it as green as i enjoyed the original. beta house along with the two previous pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had.it does not become a classic as the first two already did. But what the hell - it's still fun with many good moments, and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 just to be another part of PIE.
