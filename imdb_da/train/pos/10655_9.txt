It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to take advantage of it and take a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a pier, and neither his wife nor the little son can help him out of this - while the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is powerful due to unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this. There is a double question that the film poses. How far will you go to help the man you love and on the other - to observe Stanwick's behavior towards the stranger - does she really love her husband? As a good short story, this movie tells the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer to himself.
