How can the viewer rating for this movie be only 5.4? Just the lovely young Alisan Porter will automatically start you at 6 am when you decide your rating. James Belushi is also good at this, his first good serious role, I had not seen him in anything but last night until this. He was pretty good at time with Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you must love her. Well, I do. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
