Some years ago, I added IMDB a comment on "The Real McCoys" TV series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming, fun and entertaining show, well traded with wonderful characterizations. I recently watched DVD four old episodes PLUS Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another author here mentioned, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not referred to, but perhaps they can be tracked down via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The Reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. An inside content we didn't get was whether Kathy Nolan regretted ending the show in an unpleasant contract dispute that left Luke a "widow" in the last year, which wasn't very good. Nolan continued to make a bomb of a comedy called "Broadside" about women's nurses in the Pacific during World War II. Get it? Wide Side? No, not fun. <br /> <br /> Unlike the twisted, salacious and violent TRASH on television, which undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" entertained with decent values ​​and fine people. And I thank everyone involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We never missed it.
