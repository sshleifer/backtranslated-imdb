S.S. Van Dine must have been a sharp businessman in connection with Hollywood. Most of the film series from the study period were usually limited to one or two studies. But apparently, Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book on Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed to bypass Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM produced Garden Murder Case and star Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course, MGM's screen had the original Philo under contract at that time, but Bill Powell was busy making The Thin Man at that time, and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a fairly acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started quite big in the tail end of the quiet era with What Price Glory and then with a series of movies with Victor McLaglen with their Flag and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. <br /> <br /> The Garden Murder Case includes three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The eerie atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are performed. <br /> <br /> I will say that though. Vance takes a very big chance by exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
