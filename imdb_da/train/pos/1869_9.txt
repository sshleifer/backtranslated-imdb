Antwone Fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who experienced or even experienced the situation of the foster children. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met her father. Growing up with "church" abusers using the "n-word" not only to scare and hurt, but also as a mandate, as a young man who testifies to how his best friend is killed in durability, Persistent racing muscles and teasing as you serve in Navy, Antwone's anger slowly becomes positive when advised by a marine psychiatrist, and a love goes into his life. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Antwone meets her mother is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Surprised by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man telling her how he has lived a life without crime, addiction to drugs, rushing children to the left and right, despite his completely negative circumstances. <br /> <br /> If that scene wasn't strong enough, the closest one runs home (and opens the flood gates): A welcome to welcome home Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family. One of the messages from this wonderful movie is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children. Although some of the homes and administrators do not seem to break and seem self-service, many give it all. The character who found the Antwon's "file" when he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of the "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. The DVD contains a French language track, various subtitle choices, as well as additional features and information on foster parents. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander, I appreciated the footage of the place. Wherever you are, you are deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
