This is a dramatic film in the full meaning of the word. It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Sure it has some extremes. But now and then true sorrow surpasses art. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure is built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek lifestyle, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a particular fast food mainstream audience, this is not targeted at anyone in particular, but while you see it, you feel that someone puts the best possible words and images to describe your feelings. I'm also not a big fan of traditional music, but I don't want to hear anything else when it was played during the movie. <br /> <br /> If anyone told me to say something to this movie, I would define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes suddenly or something cut. I think editing should cut it up to fit 2 hours and a bit for the theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thinking about this, but I think you should see it and discuss it with a friend. One should see
