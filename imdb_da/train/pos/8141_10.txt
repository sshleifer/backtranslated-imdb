I fetched the film without cover and not even knowing what it was, but when I looked at it, I laughed so hard. It is now one of my favorite movies all the time. Rusty and the guys created a masterpiece I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thanks Rusty for giving us something to laugh at.
