Extremely interesting and exciting movie. The similarities of David Lynch (even literally quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the housekeeper of this movie is called Mrs Grubach, as it is in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case accompanied by clear references to the colonial past in Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film I cannot clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, just as it is the inability to cope with such a past, but also the personal memories of the protagonist are a central issue and his quest for social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I derive from the movie, but they are actually no more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you're just trying to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you'll still discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid images (beautiful close-ups of beatles, larvae, and other unpleasant insects are shifted with big dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere gives the film extra style). Maybe you can say that I didn't quite get the movie, but I've seen as hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mystery.
