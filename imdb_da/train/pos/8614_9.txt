The film kept my interest, especially because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the reason was not outdated. I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The film was also very sad and touching. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott also does an excellent job with his part. The relationship between mother and daughter may have been a little unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. It probably hit the other shows that were on the New Year's Eve night
