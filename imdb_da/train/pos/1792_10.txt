I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after viewing. I suppose the first comment has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me. One of the major themes is how we do not deal with issues / issues / stories with our loved ones before it is too late - they are too incapacitated or dead before it happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love them, solve differences. I loved the message that there are no errors. I love the instructor's portrayal of the relationship between the two daughters - as one of six siblings, it is clear to me that he understood how complex these relationships are. His story as a filmographer also comes through loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! Casting is excellent - a movie that must not be missed!
