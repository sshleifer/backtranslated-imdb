Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "raunchy" serves only to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call "reality-based" satire that follows in the footsteps of "In Humanity", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was constantly fascinated by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unsustainable sex-invaded predators who, along with their newlyweds buddy (superbly played by Judah Judge), are turned on their own by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Under the satirical surface, a romantic comedy lurks far more satisfactorily than most sugar-coated studio products.
