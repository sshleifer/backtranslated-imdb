Soapdish can go down as one of the most underestimated films ever made. <br /> <br /> A star, selfless cast that understood exactly where the movie went and the roles they played in it. While everyone hammered it up, there was no production. Kline showed white and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to continue a fun conversation while another spoke, I could just keep going. <br /> <br /> Don't pass this movie by!
