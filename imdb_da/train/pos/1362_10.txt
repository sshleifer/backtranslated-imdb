Myself and my groovadelic 20-something friends just can't get enough of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent this on DVD but can't seem to find it - too bad since I'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) We all recommend this uber-cool comedy flickerino for a date, or even just a cozy night home alone! It would also be the purr-fect type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party based on, like a Party Girl party, just like the one in the movie, like the lovable, huggable, pressed Parker Posey at the end. Oh, and be on the lookout for a poignant and HILARIOUS surprise ending ... move aside, The Sixth Sense, you've just been obsolete by a way of movies! Sorry, no offense, just call it as it is! Take it from an old girl lover, comedy just gets better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (also DJ Cyber-Rap)
