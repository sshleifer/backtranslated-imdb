I really don't understand why people get so sad and order this movie! Remember people, this is a SNL movie, not something that must be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a fun movie, albeit stupid at times, with a draft cast and as usual WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the signs are incredible, but it's comedy! I really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. Anyway, the only thing I ask is that people take it as it is - a SNL, silly and annoying comedy. Nothing that will win awards, but nevertheless, some modern gold comedy. "10-4 apricot!"
