My personal feeling is that you cannot distinguish this film from its political / historical background as so many (American) reviewers do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was demolished between east and west. Like the boys torn between Esther and everyone else, Esther is torn between "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. There is shame in certain situations that are lost in an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is undervalued, and it's too bad we've lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It's not just "another Eastern European forthcoming movie" ... it's a sensitive portrayal of teens, a fine line that can eventually lead them to true freedom.
