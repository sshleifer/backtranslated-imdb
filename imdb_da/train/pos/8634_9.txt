LOVE THE TOP - The totally wrong American title for the fantastic French movie "Le Mouton Enrage" (meaning I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it dates back to 1974, everyone seems The more amazing. This film was far ahead of its time; Even at today's highest standards, it does things that seem rich and new. The film by the very underrated director Michel Deville, rather speaks about description in the way it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire in a completely original mix - leaving to the end a great but strange surprise to do everything It has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable. The casting is nice, also writing and theme. But it is Devil's delicious tone that keeps you constantly out of balance, but eagerly pushing this "lost" movie to a very high level. (The written interview with the instructor in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
