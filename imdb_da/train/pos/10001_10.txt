Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen and love scenes in clothing store is something else. The corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. Taking on lawyers is also fantastic. After being accused of being a skin, selling his boss and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer does not push "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is also great here as a sour millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more vicious than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where homeless people invade a demolition site are full-time classics. Look for the leg scene and the two big diggers fighting (a bleeding). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is quite often).
