This movie came and went to the theaters. Because of the nature of it, you can see why it was not well received. It was unfairly panned because of its subject more than the film itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular, but it was a good movie trying to talk about a feared topic in America: Racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / Story: Higher Learning is mostly centered around Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive track star who has to deal with not being fast enough and a strict professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He is friendly with Fudge (Ice Cube) and a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they have to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (play by Michael Rapaport) is a confused child who ends up making friends with some local skinheads on campus. When they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. Opinion: Higher Learning is not without its faults: character development is scarce, okay performances by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the head of skinheads (whose name I forgot) does not fit Busta Rhymes at all in this movie. Plus, women who became gay after being abused by men were clich√© before this movie, so you know I didn't like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Apart from that, this movie wasn't half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (though I could do without accent), Fudge Ice Cube was the best performance, and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy. All in all, it was one of John Singlet's best movies, and that's one of the reasons I frown on the nonsense he is putting out now. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and smaller movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft.
