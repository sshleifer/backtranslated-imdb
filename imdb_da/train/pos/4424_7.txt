As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime and Hong Kong inspired samurai action girl with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a fantastic play performed by Daisuke Ryu), a killer-turning-to-bodehist monk Benkei. Benkei has vowed never to kill again, but he still takes the sword up to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion ... Gojoe is a movie that is difficult to assess. It's visual images are wonderfully crafted and beautiful, but it uses too much trickery (circular camera and high speed keys, expressionist images, leased colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is a bit tiring. That said, the beginning and ending of the movie is nevertheless both elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would have been smart enough not to overpower his bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and screen time to portray the endless battle scenes. Also, the way violence is shown is always on the verge of being self-reliant; In fact, a bloodbath against the night sky seems to be one of the film's signature images. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence too. Still, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is doing a traditional action movie or a deep moral allegory. The audience can't be sure of this until the end of the movie. The powerful (albeit cynical) end is what saves Gojoe; It clearly emphasizes that this movie is more than just a gore party.
