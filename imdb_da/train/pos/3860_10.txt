In Holland, a homosexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky girlfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stick to trying him. Then it gets strange. <br /> <br /> In 1983, a large X-rated art house hit the US. Why was it classified X? Let's see ... there is strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay scene in a crypts ... and it's all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" were attacked by the critics of its extreme sexual sequences and condemned as the garbage bin. So, Verhoeven filled this movie with very overt symbolism thinking the critics would believe it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the movie, who didn't realize that Verhoeven played a big joke on them. Still, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there is so much symbolism and obvious "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you never get bored. All the play is amazing - crab plays a thoroughly despicable character, but (somehow) you have rooting for him; Soutendijk is just amazing to look at and plays her role to perfection - the little smile she gives when Gerard tries to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely nice with a good body - he deserves the credit for making the church sequence and going with the crab in the crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are slightly offended or the weak at heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way.
