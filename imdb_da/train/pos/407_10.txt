Oh my treasure ... Just give me a moment to breathe. This movie takes you on a great trip and doesn't let you go until the last blow in your face ends. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and such. The legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of stand-ins. I wanted to see the right person fight, but oh ... a few small downs and I didn't really like it much before I saw it again when you understand it more, kicking it completely A **! I urge anyone who has ever wanted to watch a real Asian movie to watch this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Go and see it when it comes out in America !!!
