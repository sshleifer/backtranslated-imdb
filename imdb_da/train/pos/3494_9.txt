For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is about as close to perfection as a movie can get. Whether pure genius from a fledgling author or just one of the lucky mixes that everything has clicked on (probably some of each), this simple little slice of urban life's ethnic first love throws out of its young characters with such depth, You can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong taste of "street", but works into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story that speaks volumes of youth uncertainty and the deep natural desire to love another. In my experience, so much has never been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). Famous for the critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (ONE)
