Pleasant story about the Pimlico community in London, which explodes after an unexploded WW2 bomb, finds a royal charter that the area they live in is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it appeals to imagination many of us have about making our own rules and not having to listen to them. A solid cast of British stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, makes this more credible. <br /> <br /> There are some very nice moments in the movie that when the people have jumped out of supplies and other Londoners across the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them. <br /> <br /> Even though you always knew that Pimlico would be part of the UK again, then the people of PImlico and, consequently, the viewer when it does, would leave you a good happy feeling. It's amazing to think that these low-cost movies from a small studio in London are still so popular over fifty years later. The producers must have got something right.
