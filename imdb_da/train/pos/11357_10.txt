"Citizen X" is the outstandingly told true story of the hunt for one of history's worst serial killers. What makes this story even more convincing is where and when it took place the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br/> <br /> ** Mild Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (grand play by Stephen Rea) is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov oblast militia. He discovers past and present unresolved murders, apparently by the same person. The murders are unresolved because no one has ever had trouble examining the evidence correctly. He is driven to find and stop the killer. His only tool is his dedication, skill and honesty. His obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system, which discourages the search for truth. His naivety would have led to failure if it were not his boss, Mr Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a killer to court, even though the official party line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" The cast is excellent. The location and sets are perfect recreation of the last Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score is extremely good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy. This was a movie made by HBO Films, and they have become a great resource for movies that would never otherwise be made.
