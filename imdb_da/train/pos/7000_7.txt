When I first saw the title, I already got out of the movie's theme - it was obviously not a reference to British currency, so it should be Shakespearian and pound of meat - take them or give them. Will Smith is a feelgood actor, so the serial killers were out. It can only be about a man who gives them, so it must be a fault in some way. I pampered everything for myself by looking up and knowing the story before I watched as the beauty of the build is the way in which parts of the protagonist's background drop the feed too slowly to inform the audience about who he is and why does he he makes. Guilt is a very difficult subject to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging condition when you hope for a roller coaster - you know it will be uncomfortable. I do not want to say that the film glorifies suicide; It kills into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire storyline that the writing is cleverly thought out in detail and runs on several meanings and a deep reflective character. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he not only gave his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but gave it physically to her as the greatest gift he could. Definitely to die, but his plan is countered by falling in love - what another action complication. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I am indefinite whether it would have been better off in a smaller time frame. I didn't feel the burden and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could have, but maybe it's just me that has ruined it for myself in advance. To say all this though, it is an in-depth and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the prizes it will inevitably receive.
