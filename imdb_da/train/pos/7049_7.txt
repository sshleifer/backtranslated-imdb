In this satire of war commercialization and "noise", John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, an assassin sent to 'Turaqistan' to take out Omar Sharif, who is doing an oil sector that will spell problems for the former Vice President of America's own business. In addition, Hauser will juggle his false position as a trade show organizer, a wedding for the pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a Nazi liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Assessment of Technical Aspects: <br /> <br /> - The action (with the main characters at least) was good as one might expect. Some of John Cusack's dialogue was obviously not written for him, as he often seemed uncomfortable to say so. . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate. Joan performed a large and often hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, while I've never been a big fan of her, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. However, Hillary Duff was pretty horrible. They needed an attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian, or whatever accent should be) pop star. Unfortunately, they went 0 to 3 with her. - As I said above, writing seemed a bit stiff and mismatched on points, especially John Cusack's dialogue. Not much of it, mind, but some. The story was also a bit ridiculous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei keep a relatively cool, calm behavior all the way through, making a nice smooth blend of movie fragility and actress bias. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real credit for his name, did a fine job with a fairly wide-ranging movie. He handled the small budget ($ 10 million) very well and stretching it to make it seem much more. Seftel also managed to blend the humor of history well together. . . with the painful and difficult to see parts of the real war (including the slaughter of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As far as the general satire goes, its exaggerated look at the commercialization of war is very well done, especially the "Golden Palace Poker" ads on the American tanks. At points it gets a little too much, but in the end it still shows exactly what it goes for a young 'Mel Brooks' type of style. All in all, the film is very well made for the modest budget, and it is definitely worth seeing. It won't go down like one of the big satiries in the cinema, but it's certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
