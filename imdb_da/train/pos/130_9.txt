In October 1945, the American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war period in Frankfurt, and his bitter uncleessesses (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) get a job for him in the Zentropa train line as sleeping pictures. As he travels in the train that teaches his profession, he sees the devastated occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former strong contractor of transport company and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the Allied forces and the Germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" who kills the sympathizers of the Allies and leading subversive actions against the Allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina, and earlier she reveals that she was a "werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also forced by "Werewolves" and has to take a decision and decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and horrible cafecan story of the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black and white filmography with some colored details, this film reveals a difficult period in Germany and some of the problems this great nation must face after becoming defeated in the war. The very forces of action destroy the resources that could allow a faster reconstruction of a destroyed land and the corruption of the Jew to identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has a fantastic performance in the role of man who wants to remain neutral but manipulated everywhere by everyone. The hypnotic story of Max Von Sydow is another touch of the class in this assigned movie. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
