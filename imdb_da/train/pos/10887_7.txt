A horror movie is being shot and it is not going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells the killer in front of the cast and the crew. He gets crazy and kills two people. He has killed himself and the film is never finished. Twelve years later, a bunch of film students decide to end it - but there is a curse. People who try to end it are killed themselves. Students ignore it. Guess what happens next time? <br /> <br /> The reason is old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (a low budget slasher movie). It is well made with a young and quite talented young cast. No one is fantastic, but no one is too terrible. It also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) female nude scenes. It moves fast, gore is beautiful and bloody, and the manuscript doesn't insult your intelligence. Also Molly Ringwald is in this with his time playing a bitchy faded actress. No big shakes but not bad at all. I give it a 7.
