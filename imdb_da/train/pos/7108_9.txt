Do you like to solve mysteries? Do you like complex stories? It's for you. Brilliant, clever movie by Francis Leclerc (son of a legendary French Canadian signature Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and smart editing are Leclerc's words, greatly helped by Roy Dupuis, who is dythirambic in the lead. <br /> <br /> The reason is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinarian of his 40s, who just woke up from coma after being interrupted by someone unknown. Tourneur struggles to remember who hit him when he ended a deer suffering on the road. Throughout the fight, he has strange behavior, and something seems to have taken him over. <br /> <br /> Not scary but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my hypothesis at the end (I think the Indians caused the accident), but this end was open to any explanations. I highly recommend 9.5 / 10
