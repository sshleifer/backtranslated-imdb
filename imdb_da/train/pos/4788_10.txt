This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I glowed into the whole movie. The music and cinematography held power when there was little on the screen. The slow pace was set by the way of travel (a riding mower with a large trailer) and was maintained by the background views and sounds and the slower lives of the other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no action; everything was just right as if the actors had actually turned into characters. Sissy Spacek gave an exciting performance as a somewhat handicapped daughter who had suffered a lot but forged ahead and always wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was thrown perfectly and he became beautifully Alvin Straight, a stubborn but affectionate elderly man pulling over Iowa to visit his alien brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his life, and it seemed to bring out the best in the people he encountered along the way. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the importance of the family for this man and hopefully for all of us. I expect eagerly to see it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves its directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor of 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.
