This movie was very fun, I couldn't stop smiling when I looked at this and have already seen it twice for a period of 2 days! The film is very unique in it's humor and visual, both are fantastic and on an equal footing with Natali's other (more serious) movie gems Cube and Cypher. I've been a great Vincenzo Natali fan ever since to see Cypher, and everything he's done is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very sympathetic about this movie is music and "loses" the characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors, I both like a lot. Also cool is the X-Box Dead Or Alive fighter (you even see Dave playing Halo at some point) and Andre's amazing guitar solo among many other things. All in all, a good emotional movie about friendship. You must see this!
