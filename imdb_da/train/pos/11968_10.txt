Full House is a great show. I'm still growing up on it today. I started to see it when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and still see it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor. If there are people in this view who hardly see the show, you should because you will be hooked on it. I was hooked on it after the first show I saw, which just happened to be the first episode, in 2002. It's really a good show. I really think this show should go down to many generations in families. And it is also good because it is a suitable show for all ages. And for all parents, it teaches children how to continue life. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. It's just a really good sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH and the best time to see it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office. It makes you feel much better. Believe in me, I'm hardly at home ill, but I still know it will make you feel better. And to anyone who thinks the show is stupid, it's too bad for you because you don't get that far in life, even if you're happy with your life. You really should see it and you will be hooked on it. I just tell you what happened to me and everyone else who started to see this amazing show. well i need to go to have lunch. Remember you have to start seeing the whole house and soon!
