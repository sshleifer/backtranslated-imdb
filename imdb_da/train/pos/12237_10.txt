Mating Games is a charming, wonderful movie from an era that has passed. Hollywood must consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> It's a great romantic comedy that my wife and I saw on the AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall as his best. Debbie Reynolds is fantastic as always. <br /> <br /> Loved it. We plan to order on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Late Hollywood doesn't make movies anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... time to dig some of these types of scripts out of the old cartridge, update them a little (without destroying the original movie and script you've done with other remakes) and hold a casting call. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD and on cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
