Even this early in his career, Capra was completely accomplished with his camera work and his timing. This is a thin story - and it is quite predictable at times - but he gets very good results out of his throw and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though everyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of it - the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune. Nevertheless, due to his good cast and fast pace, it is easy to get caught in the clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original, as the married couple must find a way to live. The end is very predictable, but satisfactory. I also want to compliment the title script: very witty and fun.
