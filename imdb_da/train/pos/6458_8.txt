A beautiful film that touches deeply on the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and since there is nothing in this world, it really can be perfect, it's pretty good. The only minor thing I objectively object to is the pacing of some points in the middle of history. The actor is also very good, and all the actors can easily top actors in high-profile movies. The real direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script must have been fantastic. There are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing and quite a beautiful continuing circular composition of history. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the protagonist achieves the feeling of being in heaven, is the perfect end to a truly brilliant yarn.
