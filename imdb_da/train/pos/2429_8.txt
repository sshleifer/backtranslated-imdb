If you loved Deep Cover, you also like this movie. Many of the poetic intervals Fishburne recites in Deep Cover are from the lyrical script "Once In the Life", a screen customization of a game Fishburne wrote. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie, all of which is Larry, all warm, and all fleshed out. Of course there is gun and illegal drug use, it's a gangster movie of some sort, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the chick flick page. <br /> <br /> FANTASTIC film ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you ever go out at night or hang out in a clubhouse, you get the right effect from the cramped sets (meteoric echoes trapped in life). Full of wise foreshadowing and complex relationships, this movie is tight. All feelings are reflected in the set dressing and camera shots. GOOD WORK!
