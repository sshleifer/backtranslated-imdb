Henry Hathaway was bold and enthusiastic for his love for the people of the early days of American history. But to criticize historical inaccuracies in his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people, it is not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway did an excellent direction conveying what a Mormon people was in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the period beginning with Joseph Smith's martyrdom to the date of film release. In often subtle film and dialect versions, he covered Mormon's philosophies and teaches in many segments and scenes. I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950s. It was just over 10 years after the film's release, and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I looked at to be built and inaugurated more curious excuse about who the Mormon was. I recently purchased this movie and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs. 2. Love for them in need or not. 3. Family is of great importance. 4. Listen respectfully and cautiously, for even opposite messages have important points to consider and adopt. 5. Work hard both individually and jointly. 6. Prepare and store for future needs, 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher being and to our daily life 8. And that there is a unique quality to any group and appreciate those identified as beneficial.
