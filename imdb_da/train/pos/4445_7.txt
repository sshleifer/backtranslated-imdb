This early Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a smaller film but still shows the German director's flair in improving tired stories for something reminiscent of art. Viewed in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by giving up her little town husband and family to lure in the Chicago scene. She has never fulfilled her ambitions and has withdrawn to the city, she left by an avid letter from her daughter who informed her that she also had taste for the theater (a high school production). Back in her old town, she once again comes to mind and has to do with her hostile eldest daughter, confused (and boring) man (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The reason is nothing new, but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with each frame gently shot, and he is immensely helped by having Stanwyck as his leading lady. It runs a sharp 76 minutes, and it's just as good because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further.
