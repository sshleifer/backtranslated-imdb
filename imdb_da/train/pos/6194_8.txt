Henry Fool surprised me. I didn't expect to entertain and entertain, or as strong as it did. Fay Grim continues to surprise because it provides a solid sequel to a story that doesn't seem to need it. However, when the viewer sees the first 20 minutes of the movie, it becomes dazzling to note that this is one of the best sequels for brilliant indie movies. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. I'm a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblom's portion is so small, but I'm glad he's part of this short term. He is convincing and lovely as Agent Fulbright. Also a pleasure is Liam Aiken, who truly portrays Ned Grim, son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. For example, I'm looking forward to discovering that Henry isn't really the loser he thinks (at the end of Fool) and to further discover that he's actually a genius ... yes it's really a nice stroke of pen. <br /> <br /> I hope they do a third ... as the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should give it to Ned Fool Grim, and it should be Liam looking for his father to validate the amazing change in his mother and the feeling of close genius he feels good about himself. Assuming that Fay continues to hold many of his son's most important facts about his father. It feels like it has to be done. I wanted to buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, this is still not an action girl. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, kind. I want to see it often. <br /> <br /> It ranks an 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
