Spirit is a unique and original look at Western life from a wild horse's point of view and native Americans. The film focuses on friendships and dangers, like a wild horse, spirit encounters during its life. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning images that are breathtaking in their depth and realism. The music is amazing, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not so deep, but the fact that it is not as deep as some movies in my opinion does not detract from the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I enjoyed a lot and suited to the whole family. Not one to miss. (10/10)
