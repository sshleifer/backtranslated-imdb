Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a small crummy mining. He also sells her to men. She escapes to New York and literally lays her way to the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I had only seen 71 minutes version, but it's pretty extreme - for its time. Today, it's pretty pretty. The movie is moving very fast and has tons of sexually inducing - some of it comes out pretty silly (but fun) today. It moves so fast, you can easily ignore that most can never happen - even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental about this - it's just a quick, pleasantly dirty little movie that is very fun. It only falls apart at the end with a small "moral" end that the censors demanded. It stands across so incredibly and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed at it - a guy rightly said "No way") I just saw the effortless 75 minute version that has another, something tragic and very better end. This version thought to be lost until 2004 when it was found by mistake! I think this is the only one in release - but be aware. <br /> <br /> The action is good - Stanwyck jumps into his role and plays that way over the top. She makes you think she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around. There are also strong supporting performances by beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a first-time John Wayne in a fun bit as a gentle and gentle office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this a 9.
