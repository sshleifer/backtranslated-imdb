If you want to remember MJ, this is a great place to start. This movie contains sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy, shaken plot. I remember many evenings and going on this fine feature film in college and contemplating the sheer awesomenes of the one who decided to light this ridiculous piece of green. There is plenty of song. Lots of dancing. There is plenty of song while dancing. MJ strikes it as you would expect when it comes to these things. But there is much more to this movie. There is claymation. There are cool kids (laughs). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson has to fight in a dance out (of course, also laughing). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.
