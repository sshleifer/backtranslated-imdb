I watched a movie back for a while, and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movie' list. It's incredibly complex, and what really makes the movie are the detailed time bits (such as' Cafe Bustelo's coffee box is being recycled as a cup to wash your grandchildren's hair) that people don't see because you don't understand this movie Unless you are a nurse This is just one of the movies that is very culturally specific and special. Do not bash this movie if you have no prior knowledge of the foundation on which it is based. I see exactly what the author / director was on, and he hit the target perfectly! This film is very deserving of a better rating.
