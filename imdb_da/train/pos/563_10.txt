The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and the star James Stewart (with the exception of the few days that Mann worked on the Night Passage before he fired the company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), allows The Far Country to offer a different portrait by a cursed man unwillingly drawn to his own redemption, it fights every step of the way. This time, he is a cattle driver whose reaction to work problems - challengingly cumbersome cowhand for a war at the end of the path - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire's obscure judge in the Roy Bean School of Law and Order. Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he quickly finds himself incompletely drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims ... <br /> <br /> is not a big surprise, which way Stewart eventually turns, he is a surprisingly shaking critter along the way, even using his desire to be alone to apologize not to warn a group of prospectors of an upcoming avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem. For most of the movie, there is really only one hair width between him and McIntire, something that the judge immediately recognizes and encourages in the company of a genealogy even though he plans to snatch him. In many ways, the city's citizens who believe in him probably recognize it too - in spite of their appeal to his death and buried better nature, there is an unspoken recognition that the only one who can stand up for the judge is somebody as almost as bad as He is. As usual with Mann, there is an unusual use of high landing places, but once the final show takes place on a level ground, the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (although Corinne Calvert's youth Romantic interest is disturbing). Unfortunately, the large filmography of the Canadian rockies has made few favors by a clear average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an option.
