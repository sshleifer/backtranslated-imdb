Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man she is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls for her head, evil brother (Nicholas Cage). The writing is sharp with lots of beautiful lines, the play is wonderful, the accents (I have been told) are letters perfect and the film is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. A must-see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and really deserved the Oscars they got. A beautiful, funny movie. A must see!
