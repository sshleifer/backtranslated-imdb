Things to come is an early Sci-Fi movie that shows an imagined world, or "Everytown" over 100 years. You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film ranges from 1940 to 2036 and is primarily about how this ruler or "boss" wanted to get the ability to fly in flight again after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out. <br /> <br /> Only this movie has about 3 errors: it's sound is muddy and the video had some quirks, the characters are not at all deep, and the overall plot is not quite solid. The reason is missing something that I cannot put my finger on. It just seems a little "fluffy". But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though could happen in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It is worth looking just to learn from what everyone was fearing: a long, pronounced war, because they were about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to come are a pretty good movie that most people should see once.
