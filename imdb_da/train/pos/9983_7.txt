This film is about basic human relationships and the interaction between them. The protagonist is an old lady who, in the shadow of her life, starts a journey to her past and analyzes how she lived her life. This journey is precipitated because of the son's economic crisis and his intention to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie as family heritage, true love, marriage or fate. Although this type of film melody is not new, it may be helpful to see it in family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance of the actors, and the characters are very credible, but due to time, some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
