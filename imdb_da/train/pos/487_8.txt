A movie with excellent glimpses and an exciting and unusual love story, Luzhin Defense maps the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> It gives John Turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thanks and goodness, they didn't give it to Ralph Fiennes who would have murdered it). Similarly, Emily Watson shows wealth of her experience (from her excellent background on stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro) her character must show intelligence as well as a woman's love. Watson does not depict beauty sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is prolonged. <br /> <br /> In a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she stops him losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothes - a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the movie is come to symbolize his hopes and hopes. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly resembles dance to chess (Luzhin has learned to dance but never with a partner); She encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant traits" and allows him to relax enough to later play at his best (and also recognize himself as his lover). <br /> <br /> This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and thus finds his own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or we are led to believe - at least within The time frame is Natalia something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotype wife and mother). <br /> <br /> The Italian sets are amazing. The complexity of the characters and the skill that the dialogue unfolds is a joy to the intelligent film grille, but the film is available enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deserved it. Chess is only the photogenic background for developing an emotional and emotional movie, although the game is treated with sufficient respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed. Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classical author, the ultimate degradation is nevertheless surprisingly promising.
