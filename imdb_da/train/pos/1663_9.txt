I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful movie and was fascinated by this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out to explore his life and work afterwards. As might be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. However, I was a bit amazed at the very negative comments made on the movie because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a movie isn't and shouldn't be a biography (not even a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in itself. A movie director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create their own world. Artemisia is a wonderful movie and I think it brought many people (including some who are now making negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
