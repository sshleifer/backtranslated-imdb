Hey. I just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has too much time on my hands. I need a life. I found the movie containing a striking resemblance to destroying the mountain. I also found that I look a lot like jean Lafitte if he was white. also my favorite line in the whole movie was from Mr. Petey - "This baby can shoot a chipmunk eye from 300 yards !!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came in, and the one drummer so devoted to his work, and he drummed to death as if it would completely end the war .... but it wouldn't. Well, that's all I want to say about this movie. OH, one more thing..bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging BEEYOTCH. that's all.
