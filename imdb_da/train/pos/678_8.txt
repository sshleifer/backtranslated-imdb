Peter Weir's first international success, The Last Wave, is a primarily effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life is becoming increasingly rude from reality as he deepens into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalry. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to lead Chamberlin through rich "Dreamtime", an alternative reality / timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on the atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds on a disturbing finale, which is somewhat less of a bad impact, probably due to budgetary constraints. Nonetheless, an exciting film whose overall impression of mystery and fear lurks just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' remains with you.
