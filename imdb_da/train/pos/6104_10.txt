I must admit that this from EROS MOVIE COLLECTION must be what I love most and another that I have also reviewed. The story is something that really keeps you looking. A lot of the EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer that broke it into pieces before production when you look at it. All centering around sex, and who can bring in how many different people come to the end of the movie. And oh dear god, never see any of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It doesn't seem to be almost ridiculous, but you won't waste the energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly as the name is called. The protagonist, the leading character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control a person has over their senses, their body and emotions. And a man changes everything for her and makes her another woman almost. But the mirror is split at the same time. This gives a great movie that I wish I had come first! <br /> <br /> 10/10
