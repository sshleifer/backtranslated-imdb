Four great stories from master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen of the best field actors in the early seventies, are the foundation of this outstanding Amicus production. This was a kind of movie that was very popular in the 60s to mid-seventies, and it's one of my favorite types of horror movies. This especially shines to the episode Sweets to the Sweet, where Christopher Lee stalked by his evil little girl child, heirs to his mother tradition. Very fun from start to finish, and good to very good are also the other three episodes (with the last bit on the comic, but with the great addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire from the English cinema.
