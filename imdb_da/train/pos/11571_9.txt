'An Itch In Time' is one of a number of home runs Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s, including `Horton Hatches The Egg 'and` Tortoise Wins By A Hare.' Penetrated in manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it is basically the saga of a flea that is busy breaking the ground for a new home and the dog whose land is being broken. Because Master Elmer will give him a feared flea lift, if he scratches as much as it does, the unfortunate dogs are forced to endure a spiral spiral as the homesteading flea uses pick-axes and power tools to clear "land". In the end, the little monster lights up the fuse of a small mountain of high explosives, which is stacked on the back of its victim! There is a huge explosion and the rude pooch covers his eyes as his rear end breaks out into a blazing 4th of July screen! It must really hurt and the dog takes flight, but soon he stops the action and says with a happy smile: "You better cut it out, because I think I start to like it!" For years, this kinky announcement was censored, but current prints have restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory. However, the final gag is still the cut where the cat knocks out his brains after he paralyzes: "I've seen everything!" This was a common gag at WB, but it has since been cleaned from this comic book and several others, including `Horton. '
