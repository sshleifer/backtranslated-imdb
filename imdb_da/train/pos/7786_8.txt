This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). Cozy and light writing, nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, and on Ruby's daily life. What we see is a piece in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby begins to live alone and establish her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boys, sex, a typical young adult search. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie because it doesn't carry the Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are quite different, it reminded me that there was no one who was listening to Paul Newman. The later film is a piece of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure of is the title. I'm sure there are not so many mistakes and flying in paradise like there are in Florida. As I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is no paradise for me, I scratch the world and think of Florida. I'll be a complete red kettle. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean, who walks on the beach in Panama City, Florida. True is true white. I've been there. Favorite Quotes: "Necessity has always been a good excuse." "Everything that arises about finding a man is no different now, who should be and when and why." <br /> <br />
