This is one of my favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines as many beautiful movie qualities as this one does. This flick has everything: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie as you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I see movies taking a break from thinking). This is just a flat enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only sour note is the American dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be simply annoying. But everything is not lost, the original Japanese version is on two-disc sets and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read on another level, see the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
