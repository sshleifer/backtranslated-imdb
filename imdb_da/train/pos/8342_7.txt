Very good romantic comedy where I don't think I've ever seen Me look anything shorter. All the players did a good job of keeping this a lively drum. Of course, no brilliant real-world mathematician would even look at some fat loss, but that's why I love romantic comedies .... one can just forget the reality and feel good. Nice movie. Damn, Meg is a treasure, eh?
