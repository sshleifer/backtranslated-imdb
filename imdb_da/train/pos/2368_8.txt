The Reason: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-cop goes undercover in "Peacemakers" after his friend is killed by their leader. While discovering that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do everything possible to achieve that goal, even murder. The support is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together with another bad guy playing matthias hues also him good martial arts. the direction is good (fight scenes too). the rest is ok with Tony Burton who plays a friend of the kurt killed from the willow and cyndi pass plays a bad girl. From another action / martial arts movie (Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas) a good action movie. The best movie of the Martial Law series.
