IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. But it is also so bent to be realistic, it is sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Tells the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader in the topic AND topics! Brooks goes wild from this approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. Even though he is filming at actual locations, he keeps the distance. The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, as surely they were. They are not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the Capote book), and their action is scary stump. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killings it supports, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (Capote "character?") Landmark photography is at the great Conrad Hall.
