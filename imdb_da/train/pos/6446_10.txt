"So like in heaven" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. That it doesn't win Oscar, I won't throw a tear. This movie is in some sort of own class that an Oscar winner might have degraded it !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made real greatness with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation, and everyone contributing, you've all given a gift of love to our world. Between the points to get into this world of ours, so exciting it - you can really say you've done better! A special personal thank you from my soul to all of you that brought back some precious memories from my second decade. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and today's Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude for all of you. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
