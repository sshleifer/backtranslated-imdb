When I hadn't read Nabokov and didn't know anything about chess, I could only see "The Luzhin Defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It seems really good as one of my favorite genres "sporting romances". The chess comes to life as a fierce competition much more than in, "Searching for Bobby Fischer" in showing how much hard mental work the game can be, requires thought, preparation, perseverance and planning. I especially liked special effects on the chessboard as alternative games are expected. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris ("Antonia"), Emily Watson, with her big blue eyes, gradually strengthens through her transformative relationship with John Turturro's righteous, no-absent intense chess genius. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/27/2001)
