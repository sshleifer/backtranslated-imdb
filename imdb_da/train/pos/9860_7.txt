This movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average fun units, but it didn't have any parts that were really bad either. The worst part was Side's voice. His sleek slur was too much for me. At about 5 minutes I was ill to hear him speak. Apart from the annoying sloth voice, the movie was good. There were many side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better. This is a great movie for kids. It has enough in it to keep adult content and enough to entertain children. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
