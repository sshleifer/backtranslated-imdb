The mother is one of the movies that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or low-fat homework is for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to be invested in. < The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: The death of a sign within the first half hour, the December May romance, the idea of ​​a man cheating his wife and then cheating his girlfriend with his mother, the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something signs, the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but goes back to a collection of British (usually made television films) from the late 1980s - it has a moral level of difficulty that never fades, giving an enticing banging anxiety. <br /> <br /> The mother is flawless, but it is partly the problem; If a movie dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script, some minor actors - it takes the edge off, but if such a movie is so perfect, the experience of seeing it is raw and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing etc. - makes the viewer's pain; London in this movie is bright and open, filled with hard, cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough as nails, or are one of the super-sensitive people who like to torture themselves with gut-wrenching sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mom. Everybody, give it a miss, or be ready to swell. And be warned: as hard as the movie is from the beginning to the nearest end, the worst thing to come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, her mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it (to have slept with her boyfriend), and the daughter quietly says she's been thinking about it and would like to hit her. The mother agrees with this, they both stand up and - instead of a good primed slap - tie their daughter's fist and deliver a boxer's blow. Argh !!!
