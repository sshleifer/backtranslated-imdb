I thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well. It was really fun, and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for someone to say that it was bad because it looked right. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically correct because it was a Saturday evening entertainment program, not a boring story documentary, so I think costumes and settings were just right. A brilliant start and I will love what comes next !! I've talked to many people at my school and they love the show! We all believe that it is brilliant entertainment and it has good stories to go with it.
