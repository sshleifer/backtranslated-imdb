I had always wanted David Duchovney to enter the film industry, and finally he did, and he made me proud. This movie lived up to what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well and managed to stay in line with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder, we are used to. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, also because I couldn't see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you won't get tired of in the whole movie because he never avoids surprise you. He has weaknesses and strengths that make history more credible. I also enjoyed the narration very much, it added the story a great deal and had some very memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This movie also had a wounderfull score. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama and doesn't mind blood.
