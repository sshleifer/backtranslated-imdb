When an actor is to play the role of an actor, fictitious or indeed, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman outdone himself as Anthony John, the tortured dual personality. He put all his talent and sincerity into that character. Facial expressions, mannerisms, gait and attitude spoke eloquently about what Anthony John went through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did extremely well as a Shakespeare actor in the short scenes like Othello, who was part of this gem of a movie. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by doubts about the belief in Desdemona were in themselves worth seeing. In addition, his character of stage desperation and only a person with Coleman's depth of acting can achieve. It was like seeing Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, apart from this dual role, was much more profound and exciting. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this movie of everyone else he played and continued to win Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would watch this movie repeatedly and never be sad.
