This film documents the Harlembold circuit in the mid-eighties. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, but just as ill, this movie is a real gem of squalor. You can't help but sympathize with the signs because of their freakness. The only purpose of the middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of the waste and the shine. Here, the most ingenious of waste is very well documented and properly glamorized. The characters' love for idolatry of all the glamorous inspires even more worship of the characters themselves on a part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" effect that makes this film a work of art.
