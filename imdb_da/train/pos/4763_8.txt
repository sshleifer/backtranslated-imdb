Unlike other comments, I found this movie fascinating, even with all its flaws and the zombie effect of some of the actors. <br /> <br /> As a technician, I found that the experiments were interesting and hardware realistic. While reading people's minds via computer sounds great, experiments are now being done to do just that. I would note that these experiments are at a very early stage, with the results so far not favorable. The characters in the movie are well thrown. The girl, although slightly overwhelmed, looks appropriately stupid. The truck driver is a ringtone for real truck drivers. The minister first tells doubts. (The main researcher tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure whether he believes that God created man or that man created God.) But the moment the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. playing the zombie. The secrets they end up matching fit their characters. In the face of death, they act like real people. <br /> <br /> The movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited government surveillance. The film does not have enough excitement, as a scientific exercise with philosophical background is fascinating.
