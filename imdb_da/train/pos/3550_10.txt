This is what the musical genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action rolled into one. Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else has to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning many people's hearts with his depiction of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The ladies in the movie were okay, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. It is a true classic that can be appreciated at all ages. It connects with all the audience and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a movie to be monitored and enjoyed!
