It is so rare to find a literary work sufficiently translated to the screen that I might have rated this film higher than it deserves, but not too much. As a long-term student in Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those who love him as I do. Casting inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, confused in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is all the way through, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget about her beauty. Alan Arkin provides a completely lovable but equally treacherous Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Don't you feel like reading Mother Night to appreciate the movie; But if you haven't read Mother Night, you might want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the shifts from color to black and white and back again, and do not miss final symbolism on Campbell's nose. Also watch Kurt Vonnegut's cameo at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I'm writing in mid-December when the song gets hard radio and it runs me nuts).
