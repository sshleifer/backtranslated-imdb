I thought it was a great movie and should have been released in theaters first. It would not have been a great blockbuster, but it would have made some pretty good money. The movie has excitement and makes you wonder how much this is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I don't expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering it's his first movie he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to download and watch when you just don't know what to rent that night. It should be pretty good. The casting was great. So I strongly recommend that everyone controls this movie!
