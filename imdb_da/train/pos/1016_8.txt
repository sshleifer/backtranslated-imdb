I would have given this otherwise great series a full 10 vote if Claudia Black wasn't in it! Her inclusion as the stupid 'Vela' has brought the series down in my assessment. Bringing her in as a regular while Ben Browder was replacing RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were just crazy about the loss of Jack and really didn't need this great series to become new episodes of Farscape. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate", and when the series was first announced, I had reservations that it could live up to the movie, but after seeing the first episode I must admit I was hooked. I have always been looking forward to new episodes of great anticipation
