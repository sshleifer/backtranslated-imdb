This was a lovely presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent marvel. The quote (or scene) that I remember alive is when Hemo tires of "all this plumbing system ... you haven't learned my secrets whatsoever" and threatening to storm out, the scientist answers him in a single word " Thalassa "saline that horrifies the fictional writer, but mixes Hemo and tells himself nicely into the chemical aspects of the blood. <br /> <br /> Such a great blend of entertainment and information makes this a classic as fresh and exciting today as the day it was released. Stimulating interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching children to love learning.
