It is nothing brilliant, groundbreaking or innovative, but 'Dog Days' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's like CRASH stumbles on a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian movie after the lives of several depressed, outraged and annoying people and their violent relationship with each other. It is disturbing, yet very well-acted, and it is interesting to see the crazy little things that these characters do. Certainly not for the faint-hearted, this very pessimistic film gives no conclusion or revelation at last, we just see the lives of these horrible individuals within two days. Degree: B
