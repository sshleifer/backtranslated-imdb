A Turkish bath sequence in a movie noir located in New York in the 50s, it must be a tip on something! Something that curiously, in all the previous comments, nobody has pointed out, but seems to me crucial to the understanding of this movie <br /> <br /> The Turkish bathing sequence: a back alley at night, the entrance to a sleazy sauna and Scalise wrapped In a sheet, get his thighs massaged. Steve, the masseur is of the young coarse boxer (Beefcake!) Type, and another guy, a bodyguard? Ends dress. Of course, Dixon hates what he sees there and gets rough right away. We know he has a reputation for scrubbing up suspects. Good policeman, but easy to get out of control. Why is it that he hates them so much? <br /> <br /> It may be that he hates himself. This part of himself did he inherit from his father? The dark side that could lead him right at the end of the recess into the rim? What if the dark side shuddered in a "closet"? Remember: when Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the guy is lying on a bed, and he has only men around him for the company (the irony of the "Girls" poster attached to the wall near his bed!). /> <br /> Scale actions fun: influenced manners, cranking the neck arrogantly, tired, shooting his inhalers (poppers?) in his nostrils whenever he speaks to Dixon. Dixon, with revenge, is bent on pinning down scalise, which doesn't seem to understand: "I've never seen a man so full of hatred like you. I consider it almost humorous as you came after me alone." Four years jumped at me as if I was someone special! Why? "Because Scalise is someone special, he is the direct successor of Dixon's father:" Your father has brought it to me "," Your father put me in business. "He stands as Dixon's criminal brother, his dark side incarnate. And to top it all, he prefers men's company. Dixon knows well:" Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "Playmates! Notice how each time they meet, Dixon man trades Scalise: he picks up the address book out of his jacket, strikes his face and hits him. Scalise:" I warn you not to touch me! "Dixon's homophobia is obvious, or it's different: his unspoken homosexuality. Dixon, aka Dixon's child, is a twenty-one's son. In response, he decided to become a policeman, but that is something of the criminal in him, a dark side: He is a fierce copper, a murderer, a liar, and he is not married, brings "a dizzy blonde" to his well-known eatery every now and then, but nothing else.The waitress scoffing says he does not know how to love a woman Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates herself for these reasons. "A cap and a mobster like his old man. Blood will tell. "Finally, Dixon decides to make redemption to sacrifice himself: if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will free himself from the blame and release the girl and her father too. <br /> <br /> The end of The film brings us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed in the gutter and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the sidewalk and wins love for the lady. He is right next door. <br /> <br /> The unspoken theme of the movie may well be it for a man who, to cover his suppressed feelings, will experience a woman's love (Jean Douchet) <br /> <br /> (These notes owe a lot to the movie commentary by Jean Douchet in the French DVD edited by CarlottaI
