Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) working on the local newsstand, serves as a leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor, who is a ham, a windbag and a womanizer, comes to town, she visits him in his room with dreams of him who gives his tips to the star - he pretends his servant is his " manager "to trick her into thinking she has everything it takes, but" experience "to become a big star. Her husband finds out and slaughteres the guy, resulting in the actor's unexpected death - leading to an attempted murder and even more unexpectedly: a life sentence for her husband. Next thing you know, she's been a member of a travel burse show hoping one day to make it to Broadway and make money to get her husband's freedom - all the time she sleeps baby in a suitcase! <br /> <br /> This movie has a pretty interesting plot, yes, a little removed perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * strong * enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this movie. Also helping here is Minna Gombell's blessed play in her role as a "close to forty" older lady who works burlesque and turns Kay. Worth to see, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
