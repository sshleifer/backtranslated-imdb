I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of one of the tapes. Of course, everyone assumed that you can only enjoy this movie if you like the music of either The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but it is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of the two groups are parallel is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat and spit out Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention that it would be nice to get a final word from Anton himself, as he is clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark of the band's ability to just remain. <br /> <br /> Most interesting to me is Dandy's respect for BJM (despite their lack or retaliation) and for Anton (despite his irregular behavior). Dandy Warhols respects the art that the group produces, even though the group hates everything Dandy Warhol's now stands for (though undeniable). The best line is when the Dandy Drummer says "I won't get them anywhere new to me again" and the guitarist unknowingly blurs "I'll still buy their records though." For me this shows just how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch this movie, even if you don't know about the band. It is more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this movie so interesting. It is rare to follow a group so close for so long.
