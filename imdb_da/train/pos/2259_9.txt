I bought this cheap from the rental at our local store. It was in almost mint condition and I had never heard of it before. Clearly no one else had either. <br /> <br /> I can't believe in my luck. You go through the whole emotional area and try to get over a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphal attitude of the Mandela Party, without a doubt. Despite its huge length (I had to see it in two meetings) - it was like a book you couldn't put down. Perhaps the songs are not all memorable, but the spirit of the spirit shines forever. I cannot understand comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I have seen the "South Pacific" and read the book as well, and can guarantee that musical is not realistic in relation to the book. I'll treasure this little find until it wears out. One day they will do it again on a better budget. <br /> <br />
