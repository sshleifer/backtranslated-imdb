It's about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And didn't she look great? I love these Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. It's like one of those nail pieces where they always come to commercial in the most annoying times. Richard's character was absolutely scary. I've dated guys like that. Well, not quite that lol. I wish Zack had not been killed. He was a sweet and very easy on the eyes. I love these stalker type stories. It always makes me stand up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband usually does not like these types of movies, but actually sat through the whole thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what Mitzi does next!
