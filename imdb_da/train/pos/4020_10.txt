Pinjar of Mr Dwivedi is a fantastic movie. Its definitely the finest and finest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. She is as you have never seen before. a really good performance. along with her is a fine actor Manoj Bajpai who has shown Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in the Pre-partition Pakistan. She is from a Punjabi family livin in a small town. She has been kidnapped by a Muslim guy as part of a good fight with the Punjabi family. and then follows a number of terms, as urmila arranged marriage is due in a few days. This movie is really a very good movie. The story is solid with a fantastic script. all performances like little dubey, isha kopikar (you will not believe, but she can also work besides jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. They bring with pre-partition Pakistan, costumes, movies, sound, background scores add to the positive points. from the start to the end you are stuck with your question with the question, what is next? This movie is not worth watching, but deserved to be part of your movie collection. The ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest all the No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-rubber-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to see this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.
