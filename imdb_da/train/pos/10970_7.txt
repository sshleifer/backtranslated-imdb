Fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin of late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infected, rundown mansion, which was considered a health hazard in the city. Obviously, it is very fast that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be most off when she deals with the mindset for a ten year old, even though she is actually 53. The content consists largely of two things. The first is the conversation, Little Edie lambastes Big Edie to throw away all his potential suitors and destroy her hopeful career as an author, actor and dancer. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, nonsense and often entertaining. The second part consists of long attempts to sing by both parties. Each time of course thinks their song is perfect, and only the other one sounds bad. In a stunning scene, Big Edie physically attacks Little Little Edie with her stick just to make her stop her warbling. Very captivating, but you get the feeling that theirs is a serious exploitation going on here, and the issues are just too far away to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this as a freak show on the circus that comes every day to record (and chuckle) regardless of bizarre behavior. In the end, this is a dull picture, as it shows how the world simply passes these two. Their hopes and dreams are overdue as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering, these two need each other more than ever. For without the other, there would be no refuge from loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie, whose many cats relieve themselves throughout his bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply incredible.
