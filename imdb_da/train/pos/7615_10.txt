This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest shows ever to be on TV. I think the play is great, the excitement, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: An aircraft crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox again shows us what a great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is Hilarious, I could go on and on again. Also, the unexpected plot twists, the story of the character, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. I think it's better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who doesn't see this show should definitely consider getting the DVDs and watching it because they lack something big. This show may be the best show in TV history !!
