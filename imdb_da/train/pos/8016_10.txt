Don't think about these movies as just another children's movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a weird mix of a movie as it seems to have a movie inside it, but it certainly makes sense at the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot , good characters It is surprising that it can be a slide of emotion, some sad, some heart-warming, some fun and some serious - that's what is surprising, everyone makes a fun family movie that everyone can see together. /> <br /> * The celebrities in the movie are actually top stars of the day, but there is only one true star of the movie and no one dares to shine miss piggy !!!
