This is the one where the poor Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type murder mystery writer who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes he killed his niece and the young guy dies of suffocation while Gordon travels back and forth to New York. However, he manages to leave some tracks, scratches on a few black safes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo goes into the case, suspects her immediately and solves the mystery by simply using her supernatural mysterious intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is present as Gordon's secretary and would be extortionate. Hartley is, I think, the great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure her ancestors had anything to do with her attractive navel button, which appears during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner anyway. The murder is well managed. It is a good plot, and none of the artists or the crew flies anything. But the excellent figure here is Ruth Gordon, only a shoe over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it up. There are moments when she almost tolerates, but she consistently radiates charm. Her plays are idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she is serious or when she puts Columbo and the audience on. She also got some good lines. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comics. <br /> <br /> All in all, good work is by all concerned.
