I'm really dependent on Caprica because it's a really good prequel series for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow pace start, but surely fetching just after new episodes continues to air. <br /> <br /> I've heard good things about future episodes and guest stars in the first season. <br /> This Sci Fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a great job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! Worth checking out !! <br /> <br /> Fang Caprica on Friday at. 21.00-18.00 centrally at SYFY
