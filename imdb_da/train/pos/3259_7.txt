This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and tough. It's aimed in the old fashioned way, and it works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much to Ryan O'Neal as Philip, for he is at best not descriptive. He may be sufficient in the role, but it is not good enough. But I get the feeling that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with sufficient in-depth thought. We do not know anything else about them because they gradually appear, the story becomes thick, and the authors do not tell us much about what is happening. But this problem was saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh-as-a-thousand sweetness to light it up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And so it happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy, and if you like them that way, why not try it. <br /> <br />
