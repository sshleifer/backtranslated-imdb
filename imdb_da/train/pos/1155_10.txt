It is very fun. It has a great cast, each giving amazing performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well-written play by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like soap operas even though I never see them. But I love this movie because it is so wild and away from the wall that it hits hell out of a silly soap that they have during the daytime. In my opinion, this is the best movie from 1991.
