An occasional surreal thriller that will push most people's buttons. The 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for politically correct. The protagonist of history is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Crab), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. He is careless, misleading, incapable of managing his calls, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships and utterly apathetic to life in general. As the character himself says at some point, he is a professional liar who cannot remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Gerard, who dreams of spiders consuming Christ, and then wakes up to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases a man (a girlfriend presumably) and then shocks someone at a train station. Later on he meets a lecture a woman who seems to want to help him, or <br /> <br /> maybe she has more frightening plans. She quickly catches Gerard on her website and entices him with sex and money, having lots of both. She also has <br /> <br /> secrets, like three dead men. Is she lonely and really looking for someone to care for - or is she a deadly black widow who lures Gerard to his death <br /> <br />? Will Garard be the fourth man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does her best to keep you guessing what she is in. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie with much sex and intrigue. It looks like Verhoeven's <em> Basic instinct </em>, but has much more depth and is definitely more shocking. There is very very strong homosexual content, which can cause some viewers to quarrel. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent <br /> <br /> psychological thrillers, or anyone seeking something brand new.
