There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs Davies was a "clip" from this movie; the wonderfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different feelings. My introduction to Mr. Haines was in watching this movie at the moment; However, it is possible that I have seen him in a less memorable role. Haines makes a fantastic impression when he joins Davies for a commissioner meal - throwing his hat in the ring with some amazing pieces at the dining table. In fact, Haines and Davies live fantastic comics. The story starts with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), who runs daughter Davies in Hollywood, surely she will be Tinseltown's newest sensation. In fact, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars. But Davies longs to become a true drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and collaborates with the dramatically dramatic Paul Ralli. But the audience prefers Davies in several comic roles; maybe director King Vidor offers a case of art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Full of great Hollywood scene recordings, both on and off. Full of large "cameos"; At a lunch study at the star's table, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. However, the best "bit" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask Davies for his autograph! While cameos are fun, they and the episodic sequences help "Show People" to become less of an important movie and more of an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** View People (11-11-28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
