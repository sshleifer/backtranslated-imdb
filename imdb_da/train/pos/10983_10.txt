'Gray Gardens' (1975) is Maysles' brothers' bizarre documentary by Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis'centric aunt and first cousin living as pigs in a worn 28-room mansion on East Hampton, Long Island.' Big Edie 'Bouvier Beale, 78, witty and dry, and her daughter, Little Edie' Beale, 56 (emotionally about 13), a quiet woman who once had a promising future, lives isolated from the rest of the world except their many cats and raccoons in the attic. They entertain themselves by tinkering all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (they do not even own a television) their fall from society is great to learn from and the viewer is attracted to these two very special, but of course dysfunctional people. The better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
