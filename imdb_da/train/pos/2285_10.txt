I haven't read this book, but the whole movie I was surprised with just one thought in my head: This is so Vonnegut. I have never seen a writer, all intelligence and life behind a romance's works, translated so well into movies. This film had the same complexities found in Vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, perfectly portrayed by Nick Nolte. He had all the ear tags for a Vonnegut "hero": lack of concern for political borders, ironic dark humor that allows for stupid inactivity in response to stress and an unwillingness to push his version of reality onto them around him. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed when I watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I had read "Cat's Cradle", my first Vonnegut novel, as if the most perfect oddball thing that could happen, he thought of it, and he did it right and important. Yes, he has nothing but hoarse "White Christmas" albums. How it goes!
