Entertaining Jim Belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel who lets Belush see what life would have been like he had "made it big". Jim is at his best with a good story and supports cast; seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton. Not an Oscar contender, but good warm-hearted fun.
