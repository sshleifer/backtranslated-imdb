This is a wonderful movie that makes the 1950s look beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is exciting and convincing as a modern witch with a foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are amazing, from Jack Lemmon, as she beats Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as author of Magic in Mexico, who works at Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the little-wise as well as the witchy Aunt Queenie. And then there is the cat. I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have called a cat Pyewacket, but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only as much as his character is out of essence in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy end that we believe in because movies in this vintage have the good finishes. Gillian and Shep are just as likely to be happy ever as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie)
