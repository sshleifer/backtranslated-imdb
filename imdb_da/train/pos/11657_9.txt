Surprising candidate for this year's Best Animated Feature Race at the Oscar. It's an Irish movie of the heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with I guess, animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The character design resembles the French animated film Persepolis from a few years back, with very simple characters with thick, black contours. This movie is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is its use of color, just some of the most scandalous and sensational use of colors I've ever seen. The general design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangles or ovals. Much of the movie can be used to play find the circle. A large aspect of the visual design is a circle in the middle of the image. All of these geometric designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who learns to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (Kell's Book is a truly illuminated Bible; the art of film is based on the drawings in it). The story of the movie is not very deep, but it is a pretty good fantasy tale. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to keep the Viking away. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to come up with illustrations. He also inspires him to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forest within which a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais gives a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I consider the very best of the year.
