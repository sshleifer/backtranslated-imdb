This Peabody award-winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season, where a holodeck error traps Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and a Starfleet historian named Waylan within a 1930s San Francisco setting. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon", where Patrick Stewart takes on the Humphrey Bogart role - complete with fedora and trench coat. The office itself is almost an exact copy of it in Bogey's "Maltese Falcon". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called Jarada, which communicates with mostly a loud sound. Communication with this alien race is difficult and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their native language so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. However, the best part of this episode is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a beautiful man back in the 1940s. Oh good ...
