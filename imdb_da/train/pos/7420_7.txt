Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who will not see Elvis Pressly instead? With drug abuse and the fall from highest fame may have scared Elvis' agent off the film, it was a mistake. This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from fantastic, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. Something of a love story, this is more a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, history's hero died. Also Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.
