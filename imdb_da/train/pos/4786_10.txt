The Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his brother-in-law who lives above the state line. He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower, as he can't drive, and he wants to do the scratching of himself. The film depicts its beautiful journey and the life he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance, like the rest of the role, especially Sissy Spacek in outstanding performance as his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely decisive role. <br /> First, I felt that a story of an old geezer tour across the country would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the insights into human life, makes this a movie I want recommend to anyone.
