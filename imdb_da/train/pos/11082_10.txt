I watched this movie when I was almost right a child, and was, of course, moved to tears by this story of a fox family. The amazing scenery at Hokkaid√¥, the excellent storytelling and, last but not least, the wonderful soundtrack gives a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers, it can be helpful to know that DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I taped both (DEFA and BR), but I only look at the first one.
