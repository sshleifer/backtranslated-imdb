I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena, the curtains and just the overall look was interesting to me for some reason. Anyways this could have been one of the best Summerslams ever, if WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now it was ok to have a big fat man vs. a strong man, but I'm happy times have changed. It was a horrible main event just as every fight Luger is in is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michael's vs Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes Doink and goes on Jerry Lawler and things with Harts and Lawler were always very interesting when Louis Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took Giant Gonzalez in another terrible fight. The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took over Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this fight was dull and it has a terrible ending. But it deserves 8/10
