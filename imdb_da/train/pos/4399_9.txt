The most clever way to describe Ride with the Devil is with, but a word: authenticity. I will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderful movie, but I would like to say how much historical research and careful attention to detail the crew undoubtedly went through was appreciated by this movie gallery. <br /> <br /> As a history historian familiar with the period and setting of this movie, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about "bleeding Kansas". Yes, there were freedoms taken on the actual events that all fiction are likely to do. But the overall feeling of the movie is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no PC afterwards here), even the actors look authentic. Although Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the movie) looked like she was in the form of a mid-19th-century photograph. <br /> <br /> A few viewers I spoke to have expressed their adultery in the stylized dialogue. They cannot believe that 19th-century farmers would "speak as poets". What they do not realize is that the American public in the 19th century of this age of verbal ridicule was a surprising literature and eloquent bunch. These people were raised on the Shakespeare and King James Version of the Bible. The writers of the writers reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from the time documentation. The stylized dialogue merely adds the magic of the movie. <br /> <br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works at the visceral level. Beautifully photographed and executed, it sticks back to the days of the great Western epics. Raid on Lawrence, Kansas, done so many times before in so many other smaller films depicted with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything a discerning movie delight could wish for. <br /> <br /> For a year dominated by overheated waste like American Beauty, this amazing art was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will be given it due in the years to come. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
