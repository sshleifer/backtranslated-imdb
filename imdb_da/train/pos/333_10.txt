Frankly, this series is just as great a classic (as television goes), as the original poem is for the world literature. Far from being terribly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful reproduction of one of the western culture's defining texts. <br /> <br /> I was moved by Odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of Troy's fall (which felt but not seen); fascinated by the way the gods played with mortal mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures that flirt around on their ankle wings or poorly molded bikini fashion models. As in Homer's work, they work through lethal agents or rarely represented by classical statuary). It's a shame it's not available on DVD, especially because of Odyssey's very poor and cheesy adjustments that can be found in video stores.
