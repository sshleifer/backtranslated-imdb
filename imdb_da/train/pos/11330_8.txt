This is a wonderful story about guilty obsession. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on a lonely night trail in Riga (?), walks past a woman on the wrong side of a bridge pole. He passes by without a word. Only splashes in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film chronicles his efforts to find out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars he finds his wallet. He collects more and more of his life together. His "look" changes as his occupation grows. He must do things right. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with "bastard ex-boyfriend" he forces Alexey to face the guilt that both feel. <br /> <br /> Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to highlight the blame, barking dogs. Footprint. Lovely movie noir with a nice twist. A good indie ending.
