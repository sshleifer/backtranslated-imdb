This film, although critically acknowledged, is of course not yet released in the US on DVD, like another great Christine Lahti's "Housekeeping", the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the Internet. Davis is complemented by a fantastic story, as well as memorable performances from her supporters, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, big Jan Adele. Amazingly, or perhaps not, this movie and its stars were unveiled at the Academy Awards time, like "Housekeeping", but indulge in both of them - you'll be glad you did!
