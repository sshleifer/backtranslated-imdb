The title sequence shows the credits written on a rainy pavement when people believed in it; music is provided by someone who looms Alfred Newman's "Street Scene". Then we meet It. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who would always be something his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But he's pretty vicious for a good guy. After several complaints about his scrubs, people up, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), demotes him. Foley tells him he is a good man, but must have his head straight and be more like that. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just received a promotion. At the same time, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill in an excellent slim performance) has an illegal dice game that goes and seems to be a sucker out of the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell) brought in by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She expects too late that her husband uses her as an enticing, and Paine beats her when she refuses to play together. The knightly Morrison intervenes, but Paine knocks him out cold. It seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out that the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But it won't be Paina's story. Soon, Dixon falls in love with Morgan, but not until he loses his mood again and commits a horrible act that he is trying to cover. Morgan's father, a story-driven taxi driver (Tom Tully), can rap it. It's up to Dixon to try to clamp the blame on Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger leads a script credited to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. This is a solid film noir with outstanding performances and all the shady photography and creepy morals we expect from this genre. It holds up to the heavily illuminated end, which resembles something the studio had filmed to appease the censors. Of course, the classic noir is directed by Preminger and contributor to Andrews and Tierney "Laura." You enjoy this, but you can't miss it.
