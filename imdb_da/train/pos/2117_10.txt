Every time I watch this movie, I am more impressed with the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; script, action, direction, set and editing. While James Stewart can always be relied on for good performance and the supportive cast is magnificent, Margaret Sullavan reveals what an underrated actress she was. Her tragic personal life gives poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy-acting skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best, and of course he gave his best. Look for the number of scenes made on a roof - breathtaking.
