Just recovered this movie after thirty seven years. I was eleven years old and caught this flick on South Beach at the far away Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969 I thought where it is! was a very good movie. But after nearly forty years it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old shortcut for the war between generations. However, it took a place in time, which is just a memory. It's really interesting to watch fashion, old Vegas, a slim Don Rickles, chain smoking and a hip opening song. The play was decent, the manuscript was a little outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is That may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory.
