I just watched MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the newly released Universal Pre-Code set, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the end of the vehicle. Most of the other commentators have covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but I wanted to add a few extra notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively boring compared to even most of the smaller players, and no one really seems to have the right voice for what they are singing (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, Brisson is slightly angry at some of his high and low notes ). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between songs. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanity girls, but let's not forget the amazing jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" number. Gail Patrick makes one of her early appearances that looks a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would continue to be the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there is Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe owner - you will also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introduces the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" with barely dressed peyote button girls in the background (blood dripping on a chorine white skin was wonderfully chilling); The "Ebony Rhapsody" with Duke Ellington's Orchestra and a wealth of beautiful dancers, both black and white, blend it up. And I think this is one of the only early musicals to have such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
