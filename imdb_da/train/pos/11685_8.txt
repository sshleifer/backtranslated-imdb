I found this movie really fun because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a fifty white man's body. He does not realize that his behavior must change and continue to act as he did before. He listens to rap music, sings together and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie looked at the problem that this behavior gets him into the black community.
