This has just been broadcast on the BBC and I am quite happy to have seen it. As the credits rolled, the pan alone decided that I would give it a ride. After just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. Yes it was formal and predictable, but it was somehow added to the charm. Flashbacks to the eighties were wonderfully placed and caught a feeling in just a few productions. <br /> <br /> A true emotional good movie, drawn throughout with excellent music. Once released, I will buy it!
