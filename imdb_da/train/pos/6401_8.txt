Honor men have many great aspects to it. Good action sequences, lots of "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the big play. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of honoraries is focused on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African American deep-sea diver in the navy. It chronicles his hard fight from being a poor farmer to enter the diving school and even more. It's a good story, but it seems that it has been done many times before. A person, against all odds, will not give up until they meet their goals, which they set for a certain sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but many of the battles that Brashear faces in the movie are questionable, including C.O. of the diving school manipulate with its final test. But all this is ready for the stage when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief on Sunday, who is a teacher at the diving school Brashear participates. As soon as Deniro enters, he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you cannot hate unless you have incredible wilpower. Before the film ends, Deniro rejects several speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is, but you are too stunned in the way he knocks them out. In the end, you should doubt some of the film's pages, but admit it, if it were true, it would have you snooze it in the first twenty minutes.
