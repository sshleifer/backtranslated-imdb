Any witness to our legal system - or lack thereof will find this movie really satisfactory. There were not too many shades of gray in terms of character or plot. Almost all characters in this movie epitomize what is best and worst about our society. The popularity of this movie is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with namby-pamby, lily-supplied, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that strengthen them in the name "political correctness". <br /> <br /> All-over performances were convincing. I sympathized with the victim of rape - at the same time it found it pleasing to see her dry alley, vicious arrogance from the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the tablecloth one of the ugliest characters in all the movies I've seen, so it was great to see her former victim shut her mouth to good. The main advertising and psychopath was just as ugly, so it was only appropriate that Dirty Harry even gave him a loud voice. This was the only successor in the dirty Harry saga that was the first.
