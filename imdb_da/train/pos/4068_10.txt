Breathtaking, this is undoubtedly the best anime cartoon ever made. I first saw the castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression. years passed and I forgot the movie's title, and only by random browsing on the internet did I find this masterpiece again. After reading other people's reviews and analysis I am not surprised that it has such recognition and touched so many because it does not give an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. It is best to give away the story, so I will see that this film will be a clear and open mind. If you have children treat them to this I promise you they will love it. There is not much to say about this work of art, but if you have not seen it, see it and enjoy it.
