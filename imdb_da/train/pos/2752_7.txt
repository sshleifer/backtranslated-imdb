Although the album elements of "The Eighth Day" seem to have been done many times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Although it's not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my favorite list, the film still leaves us with many emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001's tasteless "The Closet" downplays its part, afraid of overloading (rightly the role could easily be destroyed if the actor was excessively dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a bit more realism for it and focused more on the very character rather than just the sign's growth. <br /> <br /> Don't go into this movie, expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you came from "Toto the Hero" because you're disappointed. However, the film still works as a decent, if not flawless, film
