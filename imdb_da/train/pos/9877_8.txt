<br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of movies that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Well now that you know my bias, here are some reasons I think this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her instructor (Van Heflin) is a beautiful stock Hollywood story of the period Writers vary the theme of her a little more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star finishes, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (probably said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The support molding contains some really good performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truly wonderful, like Fay Bainter (mother's director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). However, standout supportive performance goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, once actress turned theater manager. <br /> <br /> Worth a watch for sure. One of the movies designed to make you better to the world and your dreams.
