In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried" Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild is seeking revenge. She marries Hagen and through a number of events finally engages in a very drastic (but appropriate) action at the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things about watching this movie today is that we can look at some portraits. Attila Hun (called Etzel in the movie) appears as the strange person from the east, possibly a reference to the Soviet Union. Of course, it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the third kingdom, but one can see what Fuhrer liked about the story. Nevertheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
