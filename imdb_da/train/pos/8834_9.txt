A very well made movie in the early 60s Communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are teens in the center of history provide strong, sincere, and emotionally deep performances. A clear depiction of how the natural confidence and the naive associated with teenagers can be easily manipulated and how it affects the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
