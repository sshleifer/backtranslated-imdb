I love this movie, but can't get what is in this movie, it's not to suffer. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe it's Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actors in the movie have made movies before this. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. When it opens, Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And cause some average fun to whos in Whoville. We know that who loves Christmas. While Grinch doesn't like Christmas. And even fun with little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), the daughter of the city's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narcotic's voice is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as mayor of whoville. Who doesn't like to talk about Grinch close to Christmas time.
