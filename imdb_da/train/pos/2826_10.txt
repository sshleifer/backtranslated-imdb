I had the opportunity to watch this 1926 film in a wonderfully restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer body? We were also fortunate enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent movies on Mighty Wurlitzer, who played appropriate music and thematic compositions to suit the action of the movie. The printout was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative, and the whole experience was a chance once in a lifetime to see a quiet movie that was supposed to be seen. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American movie. She was only 20 years old, but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; Although the mighty wurlitzer added a lot of a scene, it was necessary to leave the imagination a lot. <br /> <br /> Modern audiences mostly don't understand silent movies ?? Action was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore, the audience laughs at inappropriate times ?? plays are seen as "hammy" and over-done ?? but it was simply the style of style. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all its subtlety, did a lot to usher in the new age: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could read into a downward glance or a simple shoulder patch. She exemplifies the truism that a picture is worth a thousand words. <br /> <br /> Although this is Garbo's first American movie, it is quite obvious that the studio knew what they had on their hands: This was MGM filmmaking at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects ?? which according to today's standards is rather weak ?? was still electrifying and amazing. The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel of Entre Naranjos) seems to be tailored to Garbo; it highlights her strengths, magnifies her assets, and there is no troubled language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptation without the suspension of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> Her co-star was MGM Reply to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that a few romantic stars would ever have done in a movie: let's look idle, stupid and grow old ungracefully. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good signs parts that are more than adequately acted ?? especially when considering the power plant that was Garbo. Notable among them is Lucien Littlefield as "Cupido" and Martha Mattox as "Do√±a Bernarda Brull." <br /> <br /> That's when the extraordinary filmmaker William H. Daniels met Garbo ?? They continued to make 20 films together. (He was the filmmaker of 157 films and his career spanning five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty, and it was his photograph that was primarily responsible for the moniker whom she became known to: The Divine Garbo . Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success she was. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a too rare option: if you ever have the chance, don't miss it.
