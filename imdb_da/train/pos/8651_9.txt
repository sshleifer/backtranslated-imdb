California came out in 1993, just like 3 of the 4 main characters were up and came to the level of fame they now hold in 2006. This is a good psychotriller who should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent stories who find their way in his work, as with most of his episodes of X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries. People who were dismissed by the heavy southern accent of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters have obviously never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006 it is the real horror of this flick. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the movie was written with a cult movie's intent - like Carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your taste for freaky movies.
