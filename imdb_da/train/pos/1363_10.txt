A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story of the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much money. Posey offers a great performance as a librarian and a night spice. This is a good, light movie for Saturday night before going out. Soundtrack rocks, outfits are out of this world, the script is fun and the actors do a good job. Redemption Value: You can do it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I think Parker Posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broken. (You must watch the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you see Party Girl, you have to feel good. Enjoy!
