I can't believe this movie is rated 6.9. Still, this movie was probably one of the most touching genuine Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie showing traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was great, it was about the creation of the shahid chapel on an arranged marriage with amrita rao. He is kind with a happy, lucky kind of guy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful with her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does, her aunt dislikes Amrita with a passion. This disturbs Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very nice to see that even though Amrita's family was not so rich perhaps perhaps the middle class of lower class while Shahid's family was quite overclass, they still treated their family with respect and did not even ask to put them down that really hit one nerve with me. This is because I have actually seen people who are very rude to people who do not think so well under their standards that I feel is very low. This film showed that the Shahid family was willing to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had been brought up with and realized that she was not a real business tycoon's daughter or anything. All in all, this movie deserved an 8/10 I want more and more of these kind of movies were made.
