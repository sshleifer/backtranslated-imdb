This is a pretty familiar one, so I won't get too deep into it. The basic principle is about two teenagers who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that comes to earth via meteor. Human contact with this wear ball burns through meat like acid. It also absorbs human bodies that make it bigger. No one thinks teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems blob can't be stopped. It is really well done because it is age, and unlike many other 50's flicks, the pace is quite fast. The story is very unique and makes it a fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig the giant gore in the 80s horror, be sure to check out remake from '88 as well.
