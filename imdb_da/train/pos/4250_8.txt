Todd Rohal is an angry genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most realized short film has a grim sense of humor and will let some scratch their heads. What the movie is about and he would almost disagree with me about this is how an ordinary Joe finds confidence to get through life with some inspiration. Or not. You just have to look for yourself. The short one is intermittent to make rounds on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you'll be glad you did. It is fun. And check out Todd's other short films that also pop up here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
