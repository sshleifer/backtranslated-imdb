One of the great things about many of the amazing Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky, in the video stores, are the very accurate recalls of actual true stories. Goodbye, my concubine, emperor and killer, and this movie are perfect examples. The film producers take a true story and work hard to accurately make a movie without compromising on dramatic or commercial convenience - much of Hollywood and especially Disney movies. In this story we follow The recent years of a famous local street performer called the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along with losing his only son many years earlier, he seeks to find a male heir to continue his rare and dying art in a society that forbids women from having such work. Master Wang is selling a son of a slave dealer. Everything is good when he pleasantly prepares to pass on his art. But the son has finally come to be a girl. Then the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional operational style related to the Peking Opera. Goodbye fans My concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's depiction of a man playing the female role in Chinese opera. It can help them understand that players of these female roles were probably not gay or castrated, but people so psychologically conditioned that they are not completely ignorant of their own sexuality.
