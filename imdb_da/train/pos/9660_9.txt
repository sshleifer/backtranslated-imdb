Only after a few deliberations did I decide I liked this movie. And after reading comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it more, I decided too much. I love American movies - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. The "Presque rien" on the other hand does not make such an attempt. I disagree with other posters saying it is too artificial. In all ways, this movie is meant to evoke your sense memories. So often throughout the film you feel like you are there ... you feel the summer sun, the breeze, the heat, the winter kitchen, the company, the solitude etc.. <br /> <br /> In all respects, the instructor draws you into the characters' lives - so many people are so strong that the film disappointed them. After I finished watching it, I felt the same. But after some deliberation, I understood that this was how the movie might be: "The story" is not the story, it is the emotions you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, stage, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they are rich, exquisite and vibrant with detail and nuance. Although I usually can't play movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it's not a movie "presumably" to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
