I didn't have too much interest in seeing The Flock. Andrew Lau co-led the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs, but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller. I had the feeling that Lau had made a good movie, but it had not satisfied the study, so they fired him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (let's remember Invasion). But the herd resulted in being better than what I expected. It's not a big movie, but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The character development is very well done and I could know the signs very well. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances. Now, let's go to the negative points. An item that really bothered me (there was a moment when it annoyed me) was the surplus of computer tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style. These tricks feel out of place a d their presence is arbitrary. I think the film should have been more ambitious. Despite that, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not memorable at all, but it's entertaining.
