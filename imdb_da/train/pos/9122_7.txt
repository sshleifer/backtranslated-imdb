Little Rain is a great movie if you are a 40-something music lover who partied in Prince music in the 1980s. The story is a very used formula: Rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience and self-respect. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially of Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U makes it worth sitting through the film. He is himself and as a showman, so powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, around Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former prince protégé, is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince, but her script does not leave her far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
