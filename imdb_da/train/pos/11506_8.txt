"Kolchak" was a television series that didn't really fit into any category. Share horror, share comedy, some social consciousness thrown in, and what we have is something I think people were not ready for. It's really a shame when I've started watching these shows on the Chiller network (I've never seen the originals), I realized how different and interesting it really was. <br /> <br /> Contributing Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak, a reporter for the international news service, and Simon Oakland as his always evil boss, Tony Vincenzo, followed the exhibition of a news reporter from Chicago, more often than not becoming a part of the story itself, when he sought the blowing city to modern day pressures that go down into the night. Macgavin's underlying charm really sets the show apart. A somewhat greasy guy who always wears the same suit, you can't help but love him. His jokes are good, and back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, is even funny. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly pretty good, and the play is very good. The 70s were not a * big * period for special effects, and the show suffers from it, but if you suspend disbelief, you have a fun series that was ahead of that time.
