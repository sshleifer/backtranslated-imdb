Clara Bow's beauty and wonderful appeal is the main reason for watching this movie. "hula" is not quite up to the best movie, but it is still fun. She dances, she rides the horse and pursues the man she loves. This movie is just over an hour long and was directed by future Oscar winner Victor Fleming (joined the wind). The movie is moving fast and Clara Bow has lots of screen time. if you like clara, i would recommend "hula".
