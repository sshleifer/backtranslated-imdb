After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to her sister / wife roles and demonstrated the ability to play mantraps with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same kind of tramps - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won a best supporting actress Oscar. <br /> <br /> The movie she is in is not entirely up to Oscar's standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sir's talented hands. There is an almost noirish look at the explosive opening scene, and it sets the tone for the rest of sudsy fireworks in a story that features ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as main lines. <br /> <br /> Domestic residents of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama, accentuating the strong supportive players, Stack and Malone. Both use the apartment with both hands, and Stack must also have been assigned his sterile job as the weak, alcoholic brother driven to desperate his own wild motives. <br /> <br /> The nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do so with their usual skill and beliefs - Hudson and Bacall. They play their more sympathetic roles with silent authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case in a Sirk movie), yet it does not prevent me from thinking of the movie as a Technicolor film noir in the blood of LEAVE HERE TO HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
