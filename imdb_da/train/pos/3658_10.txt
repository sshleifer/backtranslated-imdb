This film is like a gospel allegory. It has such direct honesty and innocence, you can't believe it was made after World War II, when Italy was ravaged and destroyed, and filled with a large homeless, poor population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as to the infinite creative resources of the inspiring country. <br /> <br /> Toto is a sign like Doestoevisky's "Idiot", a modern Christ that finds its way into a big city. He is kindness and purity enriched by love, and his actions change the people he meets as much as the miracle that works. The story is told in a natural way and simple style, yet permeated by a magic that is almost a prelude to Fellini's surreal fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring, uplifting films ever made.
