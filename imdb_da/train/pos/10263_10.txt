The "House of Games" is a flawless constructed movie, and one of the few movies I've seen made me forget about the screen wondering how wise and unexpected it ends. I first watched it video a few years ago after reading Roger Ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best movie in 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not as well known as other films from that year. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I had ever seen. The screen is a lot of work, not only with regard to the plot (which twists and turns the blanket out from under you when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. At my second show, I began to realize that Mamet's manuscript is not only successful as a smart suspension film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivation. The climate in the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. It comes naturally from what we know about the characters, and so it is much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add tremendously to the movie. I can't see any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a suppressed criminal mindset. Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary manuscript, combines to create one of the greatest films from the 1980s. It really is a must-see.
