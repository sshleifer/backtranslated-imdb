I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, but absolutely none of them match in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I would not personally have crossed live action with animation, it was an improvement by trying to dress people up as animation characters. The film pits three evacuates from World War II sent to stay with a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I have to say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest. Endings always surprise me, and that was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, even though I didn't know if it was intentional. The dialogue wasn't great, but considering that it was designed to be a child's movie, it's okay. Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialogue six out of ten, casting nine out of ten and costumes eight out of ten.
