(Sorry for my defective language, I'm not a native language ...) <br /> Yes, it's a movie that almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally, I agree with all the superlatives that are around. But I do not want to use this rather semi-invalid way myself to describe the movie here. Because the "perfect! The only and only! Best ever!" - reviews make some people turn away (including me). So if you're looking for another 'Hamlet' that has the potential to compete with many theatrical and all cinematic - then don't miss this if you happen to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, there is no chance for many people to see it. It seems that there is no DVD out there and the German language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format.) <Br / > <br /> Just if you decide to get a copy: Save-out, cut down two hours (or so) version of this movie. It's not use and not fun, and gives the wrong impression of a movie acting in an interesting way with flow and architecture. And it's also stunted to 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
