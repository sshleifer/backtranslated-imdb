I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the lonely English man who took on persona in the half breed Gray Owl. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie made me do more research on this character Archie Belaney known as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as possible about him. At that time, I didn't know Richard Attenborough had corrected it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his movies, whether he is acting or leading. I gave it the highest rating. But I would have liked to see more in the film about why he took on this persona, as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing unpleasant language and constructing special effects every few minutes.
