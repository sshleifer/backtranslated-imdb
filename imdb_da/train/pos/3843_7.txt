The first time I saw this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I believed the exciting, fascinating, sensitive bisexual artist. So much European, so much Dutch! I recently rented it to another view and could barely laugh at the overworked theme of the horrible writer with a persecution complex with a religious sexual orientation. Pull yourself together! This guy is a freeloader who lives outside the community. I suppose the real reason he has these fantasy nightmares about "spiderwoman" is that his guilty complex kicks in after the year to ignore mother's advice on getting into cars (and bed) with strangers! Not only does he make scandalous buzz of (probably tax-free) shit to make stories (lying guilty), but he is too cheap to pay for a haircut, and he hustles therefore the beauty age. Then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! But I also assume that the world has changed a lot since this film was made. On a serious note, it was entertaining to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed that much?
