Enchanting, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unmatched and exceeds better known "death novels" like Ghost.

The morality of the case is of course timeless: love conquers all. But the battle to achieve that victory is played in a heavenly arena with sweeping sight and gripping greatness. With more than 500 appropriate clothing styles displaying different ages and cultures, the director's vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, well into the CGI era. <br /> <br /> But for all the cosmic scales Powell and Pressburger knew An essential truth: The best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderful, determinedly romantic aspect of "Staircase" is recorded with ultimate simplicity: June's tower, preserved on a petal. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the story and the set itself, is one for all ages.
