I was very impressed with this movie. I would have to judge it as one of the better classic era Westerners. I say it all: the acting, mature dialogue, the history of noenson, and excellent filmography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who made several well-photographed films noirs around the same era, also made some westerns like this one. It has the same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of the River." <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the story of a man "Lin McAdam" (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle is a weapon he won fair-and-square in a competition. It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Helping Stewart pronounce this interesting story is Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. Everyone is fun to see. However, it was a bit to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can't have it all.
