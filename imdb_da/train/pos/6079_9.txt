shakespeare's player has a way to transcend time. The language somehow breaks the time limit. But maybe it's the actors who really do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the version by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio) was hesitant to take another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was amazing! <br /> <br /> The character of Iago was played so well by the Kenneth guy! Although Iago is really evil and despicable, the character played so well that it does what Shakespeare intends to do, a pleasure for the audience to hate. I have to say that fishburne's performance here was also really good. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
