The old Mariner is a truly classic piece of work that the original poem was / was. The context / setting with the old mariners themselves is fine, clear and without proof. The artistic work that follows the poem's reading perfectly matches the time / period of the setting and the work itself, and carries the audience in the period with a quiet and yet moving accompaniment using excellent still-motion strategies that are only well-defeated by pre-MTV - ear producers and much less visible in more current works. (MTV brought TV and video a static movement that runs through, often irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme without forward-looking movements and without clear relation to theme or story.) Redgrav's reading, intonation and vitality bring this touching poem to life with all its fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes cadence and occasionally monotonous (in this case a positive mood under the theme of history) of the author's rendering of the sad and eerie tale of the old maritime. This is a must for any love of classical poetry, the sea, a high story that almost rings true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who doesn't understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A really good experience. Thank you, Mr DaSilva, for bringing this to life for us, never to be forgotten.
