I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in Paris. A very nice film about three 15 year old teenagers, all only at about the same psychological stages. Many of the scenes allow us to get back to our youth age and our first feelings about sexual relationships. It is possible to imagine that the director wants to reduce the girls' first strong sensual feelings to lesbianism, but even in that case, she does not destroy the likelihood of the story. You can sometimes find the movie a bit slow, but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance the young actresses of talent, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this movie has also made it possible for me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
