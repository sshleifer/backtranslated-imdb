This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started to look once before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really shocked to think, "What is a bad movie that is this?" Today I have seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. It is intriguing, scary, shocking and, in its own unique way, disturbing. But the best thing about it is the end, where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their conscience and they will worry about the rest of their lives about the organs that exist in that river. And there is nothing they can do about it, it's something to live with. This ending is one of the most unfortunate endings in film history and very clever, brilliant and scary. <br /> <br /> And the play is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Magnificent performance in this movie. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best films in whole film history based on Dick Chaney's novel. One must look for all movie lovers
