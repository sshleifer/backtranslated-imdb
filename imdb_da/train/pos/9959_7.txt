Well, if you are open enough to want Barber Shop, then you will like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give it the current score that it has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone ready to watch movies outside their own race. It is engaging, it is true for life, in two or three times you lose the connections between the scenes, but many times, especially towards the end, you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes, and simply because it so often reflects what life can be. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone who opens up outside the traditional American movie.
