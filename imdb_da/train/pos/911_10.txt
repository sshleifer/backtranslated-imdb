VIVAH in my opinion is the best movie from 2006 that comes from a director who has proved successful throughout his career. I'm not that keen on romantic movies these days because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I've seen this movie three times now ... and believe me it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH goes back to the traditional route and shows simple signs in a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The film entertaines in every way, as it can be reflected in what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In that sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story in a suitable, very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> More sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor is going to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without Make it too obvious in front of his and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he comes to see her - that is, a shy Shahid who does not know what to talk about but draws a decent conversation. Also Amrita's naive nature, limited eye contact, shy characteristics and weak answer to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) as she feeds him on Shahid's party in the form of another's sister-in-law instead of his uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actor portrays Poonam's role with such conviction that one cannot imagine anyone else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the film and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor also does great. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to performing in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a sweet on-screen couple without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). On the whole, VIVAH delivers what it promised, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film features first-class performances, outstanding history and great music to suit the movie, as well as being directed by the amazing Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's a must see!
