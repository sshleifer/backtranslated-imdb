This film deals with Irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically a human's life after he has informed a friend of bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences. I watched the movie that you could take the script and with some minor updates, do it again and it will unfortunately still fit modern events. But the tea remake would not be nearly as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (whom he deserved an Oscar) and a fine ensemble cast that includes most, if not all, actors with brogues in Hollywood at that time, most recognizable character actors either established at that time or just to start with. A very good movie worth seeing. Highly recommended.
