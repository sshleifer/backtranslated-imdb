I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as young Christy Brown, and really deserved greater recognition for his role. I couldn't believe how well he played that part. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where the boys play football and Christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty! Amazing performances by the two Christys (and others too).
