This movie is very good! The action is fine, with excellent casting by Corbin Bernsen as the perfectionist dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. In the beginning he sees his wife with the pool, and then he becomes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and pool man beside the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a drilled tuna that has put one night outside and still red in the morning). But torture scenes are definitely well done. Although this film has the weak point that it is very slow; between the heavy parts is sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for the real horror / thriller fan, this is a must-watch!
