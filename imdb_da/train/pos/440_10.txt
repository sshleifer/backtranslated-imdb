My all-time favorite movie. Oscar caliber work by everyone involved, both in front and behind the camera. The play is perfect and draws the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care that the other main characters have been drawn to is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It's Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. After watching this movie at least 50 times, I can't find any errors in it. The music, by the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet, is a marvel.
