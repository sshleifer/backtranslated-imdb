THE CARE OF THE BIG MONEY may be the best movie of any Mary Pickford movie. In two hours it was quite a long time for a 1922 silent movie, but continues to hold your interest about 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest performances, at times, the role of a "greatest hits" performance with Mary's innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. seems often used through a single movie in the past. The film is surprisingly honest about an entertaining child's illegal child in 1922, and at one point our little Mary is thought of the unwanted mother! If the Academy Awards had existed in 1922, it would undoubtedly be the best actress Oscar for the year that was Mary's.
