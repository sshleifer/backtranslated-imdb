Every story includes a premise, sign and conflict. Characters that deepen their own game, promise triumph, and a militant character make it easy for this. Ardh Satya's premise is summed up by the poem with the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "I don't, I have it, I'm not sure, that's what you want to see, what are you with?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance between right and wrong (commonly seen in the bust of blind justice in courts) has powerlessness on one plate and skill on another. Is the needle in the middle half a truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is recited in the middle of the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri on a resturant. It has a profound impact on the protagonist and lays the foundation for many of the subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described as expediently in the poem. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying hard to make a single poem on the poem. However, Chitre's words are too powerful, and at best the film matches up to the poem in all aspects. <br /> <br />
