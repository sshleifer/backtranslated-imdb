Finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing to the end what will happen. Now we all know that the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral downward toward destruction since where else there is to go but down, but we do not know how or when until the end of film. Hoffman is great as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told because he really can't think for himself. Hawke could have been a bit out of his element, but he played well enough. Add in this mix Andy's wife, played perfectly by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; Andy's confusion of funds to pay for his drug and sex addiction and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.
