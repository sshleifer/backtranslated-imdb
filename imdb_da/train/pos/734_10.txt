This movie is a scream of punk rock fun, from start to finish. Ramones, reigning princes in the late 70's Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars like Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes. Riff is busy writing songs to Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin 'and invites her fellow students to join her in her jubilant antics. At the same time, the school that Riff participates has just hired a brand new Principal called Ms Togar. She is a tall, scary Amazon by a woman. And she promises to make the students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of students as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to nab Riff and put a stop to Riff's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has wise ways of folding Togar on every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the amazing performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this movie, she plays the fascist Ms Togar, with a sneezing relish. PJ Soles as Riff becomes an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the double Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. <br /> <br /> Ramones performs many of their hit songs in this movie. And then the viewer sees why Ramones was so influential in the 70s Punk rock scene. It's definitely a good movie for Ramone's fans. But even if you're not in Ramones or Punk rock, this movie is a fantastic blast (literally) of energetic fun.
