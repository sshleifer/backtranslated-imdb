Playing as a kind of front for The Great Escape some 13 years later, this beautiful little British movie plays it without excitement and dares to overpower. The first part of the film is the setup and subsequent escape from our protagonists, while the other part concentrates on their survival while they are on the run, as they try to reach Sweden. The film relies on pure characters with a simple, effective and yes credible dialogue to carry it through, and it achieves its goals beautifully. Not so little excitement keeps the film ticking together, and as a fairy tale story, it seems perfect for the timeframe it adheres to, so a big thumb on the movie that may be the first of its type? <br /> 7/10
