Excellent, pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by Nietzsche's writings!) To exercise her sensitivities and exploit herself, men use her advantage. Not really fair on the German philosopher, but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much for me, but she certainly works well here, drove herself and the film forward. Not so much meat on display here as one might have expected, but lots of risqu√© situations and amazing quips and insinuation. Fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men, and I honestly do not assume a very attractive view of the gold digging woman. Still, it's life!
