I watched this movie in 1969, when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night club. It was the last year of the 60s and this movie really hit home. It has everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the pursuit of success and the conflict between the following one's family's traditions for those seeking their own way through life. It was a fast and very entertaining movie. Vegas was at its hippest top, Sin City in all it's glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflicts, romance and even a happy end. A very entertaining time all over. <br /> <br /> The poster from this movie rests on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; a time in my youth and my times with my father, a good time in my life.
