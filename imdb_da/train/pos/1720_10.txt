This early Cinema card was so fun to watch. The other one on the disk one by D.W. Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) has three excellent notions of key leaders and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Nation of Birth) as a campy musician giving a countess eye and other stuff). The Countess's husband is in possession of his wife's betrayal and has her wall in a small room with her parameter. It is a bit unbelievable that they would not hear the wall go up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (father of quiet player Raymond Hackett) game, and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpected comic way. The best moment comes at the end. When the lady goes out of shock and fear when she realizes she's doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and "fans" over it. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it and laughed my head. The expression on his face! From that moment I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.
