This timeless saying reverberates in this movie and in my heart. So many years I have been waiting to see this eternal story! Maybe I wasn't ready. It is possible that my feelings would not have appreciated its power. So I thank you now with joy in my soul. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long. Hans is now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of LUISE RAINER's amazing talents. Oh, how many faces can speak as did her? Some have said it was done from her quiet years, and it might well have been, but her speech is eloquent when it gets a chance. She deserved virtually her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is in an epic in the most classic proportions. All parts equal, necessary and perfect. Naysayers can go away if they wish, but they would shunning a storytelling that stays with a life. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways not expected. But everything does not come from it with the joy I did. But I can only hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Try not only with technical characteristics of the main players. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with complete perfection. But I dare a million scores of recent films to tell PEARL BUCK's story with such poignancy, power, belief and grace. If any modern artist would dare to re-film this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic scent still derived from the core of this narrative. Time will not diminish this effort, nor progress will improve on its greatness.
