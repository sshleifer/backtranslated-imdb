In a series filled with brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my most favorite. It is not the most deep episode, there is no great importance or message. But it is very fun, and there are some fine performances. But what really makes it stand out is that it's only my only * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper ending. Zone is rightly famous for giving a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise and think it is, but it turns out there is * another * surprisingly waiting. I just like it so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is a deeper and more message-oriented).
