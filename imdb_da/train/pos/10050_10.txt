Daniell St√•l father, what a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that? In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or whatever ever you fill in the topics) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. When the father's roles were prominent, I hoped it would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to get it done. Each character was important and did a fantastic job with their role. I would have loved to see each character evolving over the years. I loved this movie, it's one I will see defiantly every time it's on. Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but not intrusive sex or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Warning, get Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it TV or. Film is. Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, gives us more.
