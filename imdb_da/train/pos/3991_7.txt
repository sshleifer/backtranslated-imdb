"If I sit down, I'll never get up again," says the mother (one of the titles) to her son, telling her to get some rest (she's just a widow). He means resting is what a woman of his age and in his situation must do: to rest in peace, to neglect himself. But she is not in the mood to "rest" yet. She also has a daughter blaming her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscle carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the all-new James Bond) when she "believed that no one would ever touch her again ". It's a story that makes you reflect on many things, especially about what a 60 woman should do with her life when his husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced such in these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were otherwise? An old woman, a young guy ... nah, you're not ready for that, are you? The film has intimate tones throughout its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences where it tones pauses and out comes some explicit and false mouthed dialogues. The vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter find out their mother's love affair (quite absurd - you know what I mean when you see it) are the only contradictory elements in "The Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
