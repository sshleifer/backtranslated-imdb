Very different topic dealt with in this movie. A fair and simple description of the local Chinese customs by looking at the day-to-day running of a public bath run by the old owner and his delayed son when older son returns, mistakenly believes his father is dead. How every person in town makes their daily visits to chat, play games, discuss personal relationships, and get honest advice, in addition to the usual spa-like treatments. When an old man dies, strong and loyal family ties make older son take responsibility so public bathing is not disturbed. And finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending casual hours and getting together. The public bath must be demolished, making room for a commercial complex to be built.
