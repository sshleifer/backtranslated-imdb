I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Second, because it provides a refreshing experience to handle the news of HIV in a family, with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, but are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice of how to handle his treatment may not have been the most popular with people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can't believe this was a French television program. It had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think so once you've seen it.
