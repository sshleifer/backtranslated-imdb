The season final sent mixed messages, I felt feelings of joy and feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the whole season nine was a lie because her husband, Dan, was dead. She also admits that the family never won the lottery and which season 9 was a lie just because she wanted or wanted it. I'm still confused when she said that Becky ended up with David and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant. So I think it's just how she wanted it, but it wasn't. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
