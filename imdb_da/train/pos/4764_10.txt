There are some comments on this film that say it is a bad and silly and such an excellent actor that Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to act on it. <br /> <br /> I think, just the opposite, though the movie is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so formidable that it turns the movie into something excellent. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemic scene about the inauguration of wine in cabaret. <br /> <br /> For anyone who doesn't believe a priest ?? even a defrocked one ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene may be bizarre. But for someone who has been raised in a Catholic framework, it is very emotional, though quite uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The death of the younger priest is hugely shocking. But it is very good. Pierre Fresnay turns the bad act of murder into something understandable within his character's early insanity, the tortured, devastated Morand, who in this terrible way returns to his duty.
