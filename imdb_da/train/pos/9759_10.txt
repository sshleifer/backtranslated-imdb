I think I received this movie when I was a young buck. I remembered seeing it as a kid, but I could never find the movie. I remember well, Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still not good luck. But one day when I moved out of my childhood home, I had found it. We were reunited. I'm 17 years old now. I still see it. All the time actually. It's one of the funniest and touching movies I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally, I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes a successor actually. Now I'm even considering getting the captain's birds tattooed somewhere on my body!
