Let's start by saying that this movie's English title "The Power of the Kangwon Province" is an absolute misnomer. That's because in Hong Sang Soo's movie there are no real shots of wars, problems and conflicts. So the idea of ​​establishing a province's province is neither suitable nor valid for this film. If we were to judge this movie with its Korean language title, "Kangwon-do ui him" would appear as a cryptic statement of emotional disturbances by its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest. Song song has also directed a highly productive visual document on the erratic choice of people in their lives. The people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly showing their moods, whims and fantasies. If you make a movie out of nothing, you can assert yourself as a filmmaker's valuable virtue, then Hong Sang Soo should be greeted as a brave movie producer whose films speak volumes of ubiquitous nothing of human relationships, emotions, and lives. Neither can you like it or not, this is the only fair conclusion derived from this film.
