The final installment of the action thriller franchise is just the hardest hit by the three films. It goes on to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he does and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this movie hits the nail from the cinematography of choreography / stunt work to the script to act. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in a flurry when Bourne runs from the Moscow police. The story seems to get right where the first movie was released. Or does it? The time is a bit confused here, but we get the fact that Bourne remembers things. A sudden feedback while trying to clean himself up causes him to get caught, but he does it and doesn't kill anyone. They are not his goals. Then we get more of his past intrigue with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons, who also seems to have a past with Bourne. <br /> <br /> The camera is in your face and follows close to almost everything. The car deal is even more intense if it seems possible than those from the first two. And the veteran who threw chasing Bourne is great with a great piece of Albert Finney. It also has small political overtones in relation to transfer and other government policies, but it is smaller and integrated very well within the plot. All in all, this is the best of the trilogy's conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
