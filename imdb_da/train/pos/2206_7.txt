Don't believe in all the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes, it is cheaply made. Yes, gore is ridiculous. And yes, the play is underpair. But this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick, and if that is your "thing" (its mine!) Then you will enjoy this. There are probably good aspects to this movie for more than compensating for the disadvantages. For one, the score of such an unknown Christopher Young is very eerie and accentuates the violence perfectly. The end is a welcome break from the predictable optimum endings of most movies. And last but not least, the setting is what made the movie to me. The actors in this movie could have done a much better job "dressing" the set to make it more credible as a college college. But if you can overlook this mistake, the setting is great. Four colleges alone in a large, abandoned, condemned building just waiting to be demolished .... it reacts to the opportunity. When you see, let your imagination do some of the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I did.
