This is one of the all-time great "Our Gang" shorts. Spanky is in the utmost sweetest and funniest, and the babies he gets back to babysitter are also fun. Tiny Spanky is committed by the gang to see all their little siblings. The opening of all of them in baby carriages, entertained by various things hanging from the belt of fishing reels, is a beautiful gag. Spanky's appearance wearing his big toy knife when asked to babysit the older fellows is invaluable, as is his answer - "Hey, where do you get those things - I'm not taking any babies!" The little guy says "remarkably" throughout the movie, all the beautiful synagogues and Spanky tell the babies "everything about Tarzan" add up to make this one of the best "Our Gang" wounds you'll ever see.
