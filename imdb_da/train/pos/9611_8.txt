This was surprisingly intelligent for a television movie, and quite right for my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well-researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who has been through a similar experience because it had all the little details. The characters were pretty generous, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and clever, and there was no stupid thing about the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it was no "diet without control due to the pressures of the girls of the media, we are not really pushing will address ... "). Her mother was not completely clueless - too often on television, they will take a problem that everyone has some awareness of and tries to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who do not ("Diabetes? "What is it? Oh, my world is all, Doctor, please explain everything to me as if I am a small child, etc.) It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist, and she couldn't even see And the scenes where Beth throws up were not everywhere melodramatic and sensationalist and concentrated more on bulimic's need for secrecy and their out-of-controlness.The scene where Beth tells her mother that she is bulimic would have gotten me to cry if there were no other people in the room, okay so i liked these bits .. What didn't work so well for me was the end that went back to the tv movie area we know and don't love especially but I suppose they had to unpack it. "You can also health E your child's eating disorder if you have lots of money and live in America ... "<br /> <br /> And I can just say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She is fantastic.
