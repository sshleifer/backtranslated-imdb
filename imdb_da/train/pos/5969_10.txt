This movie is a kind of Carrie meets Heavy Metal. It's about a highschool guy who gets picked a lot and he gets totally revenge by using a Heavy Metal ghost. It's such a classic. The audio track is A ++++. You have live legends of Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal fans.
