This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and for some expansion I have seen the villagers' lives. People are very poor and have economic and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie just reflects exactly the same. Full credit to the director and the actor. They have done an excellent job. I'm just wondering how can movies like Lagaan and Paheli go to Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria in which the films are selected. Is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the film makes the difference. Hope to see more movies like this in the future.
