I can't understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American audience to the Dynamo, who is Jet Li. The Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. The final battle sequence is well-tuned by Yuen Woo Ping, who continued to coordinate The Matrix. But the English version suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I ask the Hollywood studios to release these movies scary with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role, and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as the female 701. <br /> <br /> Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest, but it is overloaded with gunfights and explosions. More focus on Lis's amazing physical skills was in order. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and download the Fist of Legend if you want to see a huge movie that really shows Li's skills.
