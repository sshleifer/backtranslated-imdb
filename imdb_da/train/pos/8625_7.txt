Jörg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his films and themes at times, even to my liking, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, with also often deeper significance for its themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this movie. It's not really a movie with a story to it, in a sense of having a beginning, middle and end in it. It also has no protagonist, but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All different stories are told with lots of classes, although some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than the others. They are not necessarily connected, but they still tell a story. The film does not feel uneven at all. All the different stories have a different feel to it, and Buttgereit tells the story hardly to use some words (also typical of his style), but instead lets the images and the obvious sensible feelings of the characters tell the whole story. It helps make this movie an effective one to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, production values ​​are not too high, and it can be something that can scare some people. However, it helps this movie set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. An Buttgereit movie that I enjoyed watching. <br /> 7/10
