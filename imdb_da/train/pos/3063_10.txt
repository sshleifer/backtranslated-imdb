A first-time director (Bromell) has gathered a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle-aged, middle-class, depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This movie in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6 year old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen for a while. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written to him as a self-disrupted one who struggles to break the toes of his father and his business. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland, and here he is wonderful as Macy's phoned father. The film's alternative soundtrack is worth hearing the instructor explaining how he chose the cast, the location and the film movie. The basic dolby 2-channel sound is appropriate for this movie and well recorded. The kinematics creates the mood together with a very subtle musical background. Any movie bird or observer of human nature will enjoy this one, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
