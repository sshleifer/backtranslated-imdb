11 Oscar nominations and zero wins !!! I'm not yet aware of why - it's not like the movie's acting did any better then that you can do it by giving them prizes for trivial roles as it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc - were all great - I'm curious to get scripts from the discussions on Oscars that year ...... it should go in the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges .... <br /> <br /> It's a great book - but true to Alice Walker's style of writing, she has a way of acting as if she is exaggerating her characters - so I'm so happy that the screen customization took a few things out. The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes live a lot to be desired - the African part of the book must be stated in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but oh no! Steven Spielberg believes that the world is so stupid that they cannot think of Africa outside of Safaris - so yes, there must be a free zebra and wildlife scene when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and Most of all, why get the people talking Swahili - who in West Africa speaks Swahili? I just had to get it out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - great, movie making - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <I own it and I see it when my soul needs rejuvenation.
