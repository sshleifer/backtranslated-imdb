It was fun! I've never read these Chester-Gould cartoons, but there's no need to know them. Maybe there were some internal jokes I didn't find out, but what the eye doesn't see the heart can't mourn. It's such an ironic, colorful movie, and the actors are well-tempered together. The setting is similar to that of "Batman" movie, but not as dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising end. <br /> <br /> With this movie you can play an interesting game if you watch it with friends. Don't look at the credits at first and see who's fastest to find out who's famous actors during their makeup!
