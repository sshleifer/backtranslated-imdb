I enjoyed this movie a lot. Many Korean people will become familiar with this movie because many of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera were more irregular. However, editing was very nice and unusual. The action was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap opera. But this time she plays a cute tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays her role very credibly. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is the feeling of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry for the public, and I always thought it was very outdated. There was no such thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very fun and well done.
