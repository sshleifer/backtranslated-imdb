LATEST WAVE will never win over the general public. It's a slow but fascinating movie for those who are willing to follow it. An Australian property lawyer is being asked to take the five aborigines charge in the murder of one of their own. All sorts of portents and omens will soon come up when man's death involves a tribal problem that was not intended for the white man's right, and soon the lawyer has trouble distinguishing reality from imagination. It seems that the end of the world may be present and he and the Aborigines may know it, but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at its highest point here. David Guptil, a well-known face from several other Australian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five Aborigines on trial. LATEST WAVE is simply not for everyone, more than MAGNOLIA (both happen to have strange things falling from heaven). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
