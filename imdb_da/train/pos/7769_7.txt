Lauren Bacall lived through husband Humprey Bogart's disease and death when she made this film. Rock Hudson was close to the top of his 1950s stardom. Dorothy Malone has an excellent form and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and falls only for his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a little soapy from another time, but just as worthy of most dramas. Great how well drunks can run in this movie, and also how fast Stack sighs up in a couple of the movie's early sequences. <br /> <br /> You can see why the casting is so good and actually production ready this movie is very good. You can tell that Bacall is distracted during this movie as while her play is fine, she looks emotionally drained into some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this movie are so mild that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a good job of telling a story and actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end, even though no one was ever made - though written beyond the wind would be a good title.
