I have been disappointed if not surprised because of the lack of recognition this movie has received. Once again, Billy Zane proves he is more than just a Hollywood-looking boy in a quiet performance combining spastic slapstick with underrated pathos. Calling this a silent movie is inaccurate, as there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic pace and is filled with the greasy ingenuity that Ed Wood finally begins to appreciate. Look at the quoted quotation and realize that everyone is shining. No one is there to show their face. I think they are all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood, and to make a broad, physical form of performance not seen so much today. <br /> <br /> But today, proofreaders are trying to guess what's going to be a hit much more than they show any kind of aesthetic understanding of a movie. And IWUETDID has no visible audience. It was made mostly out of love for Woods script. Even after his death, the trendy social parasites have exploited him another serious blow and deprived of a smaller class world. This is a very entertaining and truly experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
