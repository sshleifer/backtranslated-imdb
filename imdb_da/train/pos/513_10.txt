<br /> <br /> Filmed just after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended up being honored to be the first royal premiere after World War II. <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that the film merges with the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, US founders and various others up the long stairs (special effects in his childhood) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of Its integrity. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this talented script dances the viewer between the sky and the earth with a mountaineering skill and presents a charming lightness rarely matched in the cinema side. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to get your heart heated by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey seems like a man obsessed with stealing the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British Cinema will cry when it remembers how well it used to be in the early postwar years. <br /> <br />
