I remember watching this movie as a child. I can't remember where I saw it. I must have been about 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wanted to see it again. It once came on the Kung Fu channel, but I missed it. I was really bummed. It's the best special effects Kung Fu movie I've seen to date! I highly recommend it, and now that I have discovered where I can get it, I can enjoy it again and again in the years to come. I must also check out this Return of the Venom movie that some have spoken so highly.
