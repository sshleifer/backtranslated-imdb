An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. The audience must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite a contrast from his "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney adds sparkle and interest to a rather routine tired outline story and plot. But the highlight of the movie is the 3 detailed production numbers back and forth. Only with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, followed by the very spectacular eye-catching "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the final "Shanghai Lil" sequence, Cagney only participates in the last number head on top of a bar count Ruby Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number with Cagney is excellent, but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic after the more exciting and incredibly fun boggling "By A Waterfall" choreography. If I was a director, I would have inserted the "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and close to "At a waterfall", which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water to say and in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the frost on the cake and James Cagney's performance is added to the cake decoration. An excellent musical performance, a 4-star movie, the ultimate musical, worth seeing, you won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
