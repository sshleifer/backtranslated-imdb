Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I was sometimes questionable whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of history. Honestly, she is so terribly self-righteous and estimates that you are tempted not to suffer seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation saves Emma herself for saying: she is portrayed with all her innocence and generosity in full view, and you cannot help giving in and suffering (not to say love) despite her less beloved qualities . Kate Beckinsale is the most important but not the only reason why this television series is so lovely; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr Frank Churchill, who expresses this person's personal magnetism to the full (which is more evident because this role is not much dealt with by Ewan McGregor in the 1996 screen adaptation of Emma) Mark Strong, Samantha Morton , Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. In short, this production is a great achievement and one to see many times with increasing joy.
