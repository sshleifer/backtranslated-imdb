Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the great Wrestlemania's, but I would personally put it in my top 5, if not the top 3. It has so many good things, and it really meant the birth of The Attitude Era which was WWE's best era, in my opinion. HBK has a heart in a lion and he put over Austin as he did, on his way out, was pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see and it has J.R and The King at their advertising best! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? keep fighting royal LOUD pop for L.O.D's return. I'm not a fan of royal royalty, and it's another average. Very predictable, even when you first see it, the obvious L.O.D would win. Looking at Sunny for 8 or so minutes, but certainly helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Take Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop with its entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would probably have torn off their stuff. Take the winner with the Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, Chyna is handcuffs for slaughter. Nice pop for the Owen, mixed reaction to the tours. A really really underestimated battle that actually belongs to one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two mingle well, and Owen can go with someone. Trips wins, with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag match. Marc Mero & Sable vs Goldust & Luna. Defines pop for Sable, unheard of by the time for woman. Sable actually looks good and the crowd just eats her up! Constant Sable chants and they erupt almost every time she comes in the ring. Not bad for a Mixed Tag match, it had entertaining antics, and passed the time well. Sables team wins when Sable hits TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before going through the fight, I would like to note The Rock showed its enormous potential, with his interview with Jennifer Flowers, before his battle. Nice pop to Shamrock, great time warm to The Rock. Too disappointing cards, and I thought the end was a little stupid, even though Shamrocks snapping antics were great to see and the audience had to. Rock holds the title when The Ref turns the decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dumpster match, for WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk vs The New Age Outlaws. Outlaws are not as over as they should be at this time. The crowd is actually dead for this, but I thought it had some good hardcore bits, with some sick looking. Cactus and Terry eventually win the titles. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Big time ovation, for The Undertaker. Much better than an outing at Wrestlemania 20, and for a big man vs big man match, it was really good. It was a great all out brawl, with The Undertaker taking a sick look through the table. WWE was smart in making Kane strong even through defeat. After 2 tombstones kick out, Taker finally puts him away, with a 3rd one. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs. Steve Austin. Great heat to Tyson. Crowd goes ape sh * t to Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is really a special battle up, one of the greatest wrestlemania's most important events in history, you can tell when J.R is even exhale. HBK gives it all its supposed to be his last match, and Austin has rarely been better. The hostility and electricity from the crowd is amazing and it is as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with the anesthetic, with Tyson ending 3:16 by knocking Michaels out. Austin's festive victory is a wonder to see, with one of the curious crowds you will ever see, King said it right, they went nuts. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the largest for real. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and really kick started the Attitude Era. This is very special to me because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I have ever seen, back in 98. "Austin Era has begun!" 9 1/2 / 10
