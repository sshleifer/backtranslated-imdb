Deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn, every turn, in fact, the biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the movie and it often makes no sense even though they usually take you surprised. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists. The play is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can't catch all the development because of the twists and turns. The performances especially of Caine are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can lead. The visual effects are fair, but again most are actually in a game and fake. Turns too much, but still works and is worth seeing.
