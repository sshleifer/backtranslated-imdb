Elvira, Mistress of The Dark, is a fun, camp war comedy where the fourth wall is broken a few times, and the jokes are often under the navel. And the Cassandra Peterson breasts become their own character. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is stacked with a horror show hostess who learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. Then she goes to a small town of Fallwell, run by the most horrible monster ever to embrace the earth: Morality comity. Elvira's boobacious look is of course too much for the princes, but the children in town get a kick out of her different kind of approach to life. And of course, there are even more vicious evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard) who is after Elvira's mother's book of magic. Look, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just doesn't know. Yet. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is quite a funny movie, even though the manuscript provides plenty of room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are also a few good visual gags. Over all directions is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. All in all, a good, conscious campy, comedy. If you like this kind of thing then it is.
