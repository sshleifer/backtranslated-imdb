Diagnosis Murder has been shown on most weekday afternoons on BBC1 when I used to watch it while I was ill from school a good 10 years ago - I know I shouldn't really enjoy it the same way I couldn't enjoy it ' Murder she wrote "but I'm totally dependent on both and even have the DVD box sets .... OK, I know it's boring! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke wears the show as he stars as Dr. Mark Sloan a Doctor at Community General Hospital in LA, who is also the police consultant for the LAPD - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real son) is a police officer who needs his father's help on many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> In continuation of the trip, Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) is the resident pathologist at Community General and for the first few seasons you have had Scott Baio with Dr. Jack Stewart who opened and left the series in 1995 hoped to move on to bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was in Kke did nothing for anything since .... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh dear !!! DrJack Stewart is at least replaced by the younger Dr. Jesse Travis, played by Charlie Schlatter, who pulled into Baio's shoes quite comfortably. <br /> <br / The series is extremely unlikely, but which Whodunit series is not? (Murder she wrote - anywhere Jessica goes, ends up killing, or the undervalued father Dowling Mysteries about a murderous priest with Nun Sidekick) The series was much easier until 1997, because it had a supportive casting that included the bumbling Hospital Manager Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci along with Nurse and Mark's Secretary Dolores played by Delores Hall. After 1997, both of these characters were no longer included, and the series became a gritty affair with a larger budget, some episodes included much more action, an episode throughout the hospital burst. <br /> <br /> This was a family program For Van Dyke is because as well as Dick's son Barry, you also had Dick's daughter and all his grandchildren to make a look in various episodes. <br /> <br /> When the series went on, it got a little silly, an episode, I remember Dick van Dike playing his whole family, which was a little beyond normal, but throughout the "Diagnosis Murder" was a real good tv show, which had many good guest stars. Since this show was completed in 2001, Dick & Barry has reappeared in the "MURDER 101" series of television films made by The Hallmark Channel, beautifully looking for the same path, and still fun. Dick, now in the mid-80s, does not seem to change much, and looks as though he will work to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** FROM *** **
