Does anyone know where or how to get a copy of this movie? !! I've been searching for too long, someone helps! Back in 1997, my girlfriends and I were extra on this Long Island-based movie and we never actually got to see it. :( <br /> <br /> I hoped I could find a copy somehow so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so I can stop driving me crazy? (also, it doesn't matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in ice age.) If you or someone you know has a copy of this movie, you help, I would be willing to pay for a good copy of it!
