Well, what can I say other than these people are super in every way. I like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure nostalgic series and I have boxed with 9 discs 30 episodes, I did not understand that they had made so many, I also think it is a great shame that they do not have made more. I wish I had these powers, Imagine being beaten off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold and then waking up in a special hospital. Later, I find that my body has been improved. Like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and excitement all the way. You can't fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all kinds of weapons. The music is well written, and for me I put a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my heart. The kind of powers that the masters have are the same as our livestock or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women to Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a big crush on her !!!! Now I can see why, on my DVD set. The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet about the series. I also thought Trymane was a good boss, though he got things done!
