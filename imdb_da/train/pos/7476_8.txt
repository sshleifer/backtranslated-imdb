I can really say that I felt the movie in its real essence, where the mind games from the dreamy reality go into the surreal aspect of the future that Tom Cruise faces. I didn't like much about Tom Cruise's performance, but I have to say that he seems to impress at all points in the movie ... not just because of an engaging story but also because his self is being handed over to the protagonist .. .. they merge and then speak and it is beautiful. But I have to say that this movie does not come under the "average of weekend" that you randomly choose and look happy; It carries strong feelings and signs, so don't wash it with your beer and popcorn. It certainly needs more than that.
