Seeing "The Fox and the Child" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, the integrity of the view, and the complete beauty of the setting and the characters left me in a swim of pleasure. The reason is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Within the container of this simplicity, a world unfolds that pulls you in and leaves you breathable. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can trust yourself - persuade you. Dare I say it's a love that is meant for every innocent heart. It reaches the hearts of the viewers - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if viewed from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel that I have been privileged to see - no, to participate in - this film, a work of true art.
