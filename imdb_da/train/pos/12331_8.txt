Being a person who listens Night of the Living Dead at number three in her top five favorite films all the time, and at the same time loves this student movie parody, I feel I must defend this movie against the previously released scathing reviews. This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser on horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who participate have a love for the genre yet knowing they don't take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It's supposed to be fun, and many others I've heard chant for and welcome, agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Beware that the director came as news reporter Jeff Drexel and also if you have the opportunity to catch his Alien parody, Loaf.
