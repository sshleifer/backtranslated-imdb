Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit not only resides in American civil liberties but also in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, transcends the Danish hero Niels Arden Experience this belief in a Danish middle school from 1969. More specifically, it goes in the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressive rigid and churlishly abusive principal Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are performed with certain aplombs and a refreshing command of its varied characters keeps it involved. A struggle of ideologies between a 13-year-old and a disciplined disciplin allows room for intrinsic humor, but eerie shifts in mood swings, although it is sharply cynical in the same vein as a "Dead Poets Society" more than a "Matilda". It enters a well-known path, but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist, including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becomes a young man, manages to raise the film in a bursting family movie with his nose straight on the money.
