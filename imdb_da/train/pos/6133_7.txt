Easily the biggest low budget horror movie all the time. I first saw this movie when I was about nine years old and I have to say that it scared hell out of me. Now that I've grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a genius work. Everyone or at least everyone with a taste has dreamed of seeing a snowman walking around and killing people, even though they will not admit it. I have always found something really scary for snowmen, so of course for a scary junkie like myself, this movie was a dream come true. Some people say this movie is stupid, or is otherwise void of any intelligence ... it's a serial killer-snowman movie, what the hell are you expecting? Anyone who gave this movie a low score is of course too close to sit back and have a good laugh on stupid one-liners and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wakes up and makes a serious horror story about a killer snowman (who seems impossible, unfortunately) I will forever keep this big piece of indie horror close to my heart.
