James Michener's books that took readers to distant places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His stories about the South Pacific became a major blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein. The South Pacific was led by Joshua Logan and he was natural to make the movie adaptation of another Michener success Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films during World War II did not portray Japanese friendly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people fighting for the Pacific War to change attitudes overnight. It and a generally no fraternity policy with occupied populations in general is at the heart of this story of interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant movie today. The military has always touched on the personal life of its people in ways that no civilian employer could get away with legally. In America at the time Sayonara was made, there were still miscegenation laws on the books of many states. Today, gays in the military are a big problem. Someone can one day make a Sayonara movie about that problem. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was well known. The South Pacific also had racism as part of its reason. With a safe hand, Logan gathered a great cast and craft a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, some Western players do a good job. But the picture is stolen by the Oriental here. Miko Taka strikes the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two, both of which support players Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. Buttons are your everyman enlisted man Air Force member. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military terribly does everything they can to destroy them. They suppose to know what's best for buttons and Umeki. Buttons were a TV comedian and a fair talent, but he never got much as good as this for the rest of his career. And Miyoshi Umekis Oscar was the first to an oriental. It became very attentive because at the time of the Academy Awards Miyoshi starred on Broadway in the Flower Drum Song. I was privileged to see it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still remember it. <br /> <br /> The Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw in Sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, a kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara was made today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This movie has to be revived more often, it has a good morale.
