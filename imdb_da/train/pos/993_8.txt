In fact, this movie wasn't that bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this movie, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy from "The Green Mile") who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me was David Morse as Edgar Clente. He plays different character than he usually does, because in other films such as "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person and in "Bait" plays almost the opposite , a man without emotion, who was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this movie is the many pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this movie look a bit dated. All in all, I thought it was a great little movie!
