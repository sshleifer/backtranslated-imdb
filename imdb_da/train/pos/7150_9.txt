What a great movie! This is reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family films from the 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised that after the last 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney's live production crews have turned out. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. The stars were just that; professional, quality actors. I am most impressed with the quality of this movie. Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic * insert hyperbole here * running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was great as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I don't want to regain the story here as there is no point to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the working quality was excellent! This work reminds you how it is to be a child without going all sugary or being too gloomy. The deleted scenes highlighted on the DVD version were really best to be deleted. They were too hard for this movie and would have taken so much of it. While the abuse was indicated in the finished product, it was not shown to any great extent. It was the best that way. <br /> <br /> It was a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It will be a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
