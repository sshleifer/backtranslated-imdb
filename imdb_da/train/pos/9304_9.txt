This movie is amazing. Simply. It is rare that you find a comedy with levels, and this is a bloody good example of that. When I first watched this movie when the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... "Did you just catch it?" For the doubt, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people of the club, DNA! See the different characters each disturbing the position, and if you don't see anything else, see the connection between Vick's cure and the path through the movie. IT'S ALL IN VICK'S HEAD! The opening line of Vicks world. The final scene with the camera goes into Vick's head and inside a whole universe! Thoroughly quotable, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
