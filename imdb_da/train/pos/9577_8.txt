Finally we have a Category III movie before the summer of 2006 season. Performed by equal parts cruelty, crime and passion benefits Dog Bite, however, not only from an appropriate title but also flexible direction, excellent filmography and respectable beliefs from most involved. Of course, there must be a catch that is manifested here in the form of several clear inconsistencies, but thus it is said that DBD represents the mature spirit, we will love to see more of HK mainstream. <br /> <br /> It's also marking Edison Chen's re-emerging return, missing since the first D-debacle a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo wonders for the movie, but would have had the rough without opposite Sam Lee whose ability to switch between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and lunatic threat has culminated in the strongest role we 'I've seen from him since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo creates Dog Bite Dog, and hopefully Edison will now have an easier break as a result: His touch-transformed projects from Princess D to the Infernal Affairs saga, and yet he is still a rare occurrence. <br /> <br /> Mostly at the beginning, DBD shows some fascinating images and plays beautiful tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack increases this atmospheric effect and adds to the overall unreal mood of the film purveys. Much of the resulting combination has enough to do with author Matt Chow, who has previously been involved in equally gruesome Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains several features that are recalled from the horror project, namely rundown urbanscapes and a penetrating air of something creepy lurking around the corner. Be sure this is not a horror movie, but instead of a path previously believed by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit from a mile more perverse angle. Replacing Daniel Wu's reluctant mainland murder character we have Edison plays a nameless killer off the back of Cambodia's underworld. Sent Hong Kong way to accomplish a single goal, the almost silent killer takes care of the business immediately upon arrival, a process that cools cheaply with the movie's brilliant visuals. <br /> <br /> Although accustomed from childhood to becoming a professional killer, Edison's eponymous wild still has human weaknesses and leaves a trace picked up by a CID team sent to investigate. This collection has a nice cameo of mob movie stalwart Lam Suet, and good support from the TV star Wayne Lai. However, Sam Lee's dismissal officer Wai leads the charge and reveals to be a highly disturbed person, but excellent politician anyway. We gradually learn Wai's inner conflict derives from his father's police base of corruption and evokes demons useful in the relentless pursuit that follows. <br /> <br /> A smaller body count shows when Edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no-no. There is quite a rape in the store, although Gore per se feels toned down in places, and adult language only makes a token look. Once again, no nudity is given leading to the conclusion of Cat III's. However, DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release and we welcome its arrival. In between fighting, stabbing, hacking and shooting, even a career assassin requires some romance, and like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, it also does involuntarily. Chen gets a treasure, beautifully made by newcomer Pei Pei. Her named character (very anonymity in this one) meets Edison's strange desert landfill, abused by her father to the point of abominable madness and longing for escape. When killer dike HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they flee together, love to bloom on the road. While the movie does not dwell on lovey-dovey things, our hearts go out to Pei Pei's tragic character and her endless suffering. She makes the crooked but faithful protagonist very amazing and states that there are no good or bad guys here, evinced by the very annoying final. Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes the latest thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts of Dog Bite Dog's outrageous behavior. Cheang manages to keep DBD floating throughout, and given the many parts in play here, critical standards are set by people like Johnny To in his waterfront nightly epic Mission. A few glitches are happening because Edison miraculously pushes a shot to the chest, but these are very forgiving. <br /> <br /> Marking triumphant returns for two young talented artists of the kind that Hong Kong needs, if we want the city's flowery movie to come back, Dog Bite Dog is not up to the story. Its forte lies in strong depictions and style bred by the thespian muscle and a huge eye for visual and auditory finesse. <br /> <br /> HK has a long tradition of storytelling with the city's nighttime alter-ego, something Dog Bite Dog lovingly maintains and constitutes a solid race if not a direct masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
