TACHIGUI: FAST-FOOD GRIFTER'S FANTASTIC LIFE Japanese title: Tachiguishi Judiciary Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Designed by Koichi Yamadera - ------------ -------------------------- <br /> The way back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii released its dazzling animation feature Ghost In The Shell, who helped consolidate Anime's international acceptance - and also entered into Andy and Larry Wachowski's overall concept of The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The movie's sequel, Innocence (2004), was the initial Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and it left the heads that spanned so much for its style and innovative effects as for its often unimaginable plot. <br /> <br /> Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast Food Grifters ?? who has nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell or Japanese anime for that matter. Hello to Oshii's creation "super livemation": Not quite animation or even live-action. Instead, the cast destroyed somewhere near 30,000 snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper-cut fashion reminiscent of Balinese doll. The movement itself is a styled stop-motion style that echoes sequences from the Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). "I couldn't think of any method but this one," Oshii said in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice chosen is just as enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while the famous Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki uses his screen time to be murdered in bizarre fashion. Others are Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects whiz who has worked on Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's story sounds like a dry NHK documentary ?? which highlights cartoon undertone here as well as Yamadera's comprehensive career voicing stoic anime characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is a bizarre re-depiction of post-WWII Japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots - from soba frame shops to gyudon stand-up bars; American dogs in grocery stores for grocery stores for McDonald's inspired burger-chain restaurants. "Food is a primary root of desire," Oshii claimed, as an explanation. <br /> <br /> The mix of the mix is ​​a new breed of consumer: titles fast food businessmen, people who don't like paying for their tucker and constantly fine-tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his rear motif was a tribute to the "art" of eating food on the streets ?? something is still considered a bit like a taboo in this country, and some way of explaining the use of "tachigui" in the title. The director of live-action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation Oshii often blurred the definition of the two media. The celluloidal result here is deposited somewhere in the gray area between both formats. <br /> <br /> At times, the visual experiment here is just as exciting as it can be annoying. Just don't ask what it all really means; Oshii's films, which are equally cerebral and innovative, are often not very clear in history. Where does Oshii succeed through a liberal dose of black humor? here you find Kentucky Fried Rat, dead of the hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger manager ?? and in the film's very nature of surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is a man who disappears for the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and may owe so much to Andrei Tarkovsky as he does David Lynch. So it should come as no surprise that at one point a B-52 bomber makes a fly-through in a Yoshinoya look-alike franchise. The 54-year-old author director seemed to think it was natural. "Japan, I portrayed in the movie, may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
