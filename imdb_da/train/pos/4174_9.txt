... when this movie proves so good that they are actually unnecessary. Although there were few lines, it was so strange to see this movie, no subs, in an unknown language. One of my friends sent a VHS, included a few papers with all lines translated into English. with her translation beside me, I began to see this story (it is actually a story), and from the very first melody's melodies during the opening I was stuck. the colors, the minimal action (in most cases), the absurd comedy, the slapstick, the thoughtful, the beautiful ... along with a few other films (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni) can speak to everyone's heart - without words. When you get the chance, watch it. Whatever you do - do not miss it. It is an experience once in a lifetime. Oh, plays are amazing, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
