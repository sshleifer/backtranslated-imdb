I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully done, from movie to play. It is the story of a father and son, and how they will appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never calls false, the film Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among other things in this excellent cast. The movie begins with the aging father (Peter Falk) trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. The father presents himself unannounced on his son and son-in-law dies. The father and son leave the next day to look at some properties and end up taking a classic car ride. They fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a barroom brawl and dance with strange women. But more importantly, they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of movie that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those closest to them.
