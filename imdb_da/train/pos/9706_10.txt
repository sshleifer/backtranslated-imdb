The Gentlemen League is one of our most fun, strange, darkest and most unforgettable comedies. So much paved the way for more comedies of his ilk, many of which have copied the style, but have never been. <br /> <br /> Unlike all other sketches, the characters in The League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, at the back of northern England. <br /> <br /> The first signs of greeting newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad. The pig-configured owners of a supposedly local store are so far away, most of the residents probably do not know its existence. Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an occupancy of hygiene, chastity and amphibians; Hillary Briss, who sells a special yet fortunately unknown brand of meat; Pauline, a restart officer with a sharp heavy and even sharper pencil; Mr. Chinnery, kindhearted vet and threatened for all things, four-legged; Geoff Tipps, a plastic dealer with vicious humor, often involving weapons, electric tubes and. . . . . . . Plums !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy in the heart, gentleman's league often transcends genres, while it never seems to be spoofing or ripping off others' material. There are several horror references that a wanderer disappears, a few silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. Even more striking are moments when the series takes a more sober tone, and the above signs like Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. The movie adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong. <br /> <br /> The equally underrated third series also takes another route, instead of sketches, each episode focuses on an individual character with each story leading to a conclusion involving a plastic bag and an ongoing theater business. Although many fans may not enjoy the film's structure or the third series as much as the first two, they are certainly indicative of how inventive The Gentlemen League can be, and how scared to explore new areas. <br /> In short, The Gentlemen League is definitely worth a visit as the welcome characters say: You will never leave!
