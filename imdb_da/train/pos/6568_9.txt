I enjoyed this movie as a child when it came out, and to this day it still does. A simple story that involves the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of the paperback lore. It has actors who were more recognizable back in the day. This should not keep the viewer from giving it a whirl. Wayne Crawford stars as the main character Jake Speed. Sure, it can bite some elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this film is made good enough to keep it out of the basement. I'm surprised not many people know. It must have been overshadowed by other films in the theaters back in '86. I saw it again on cable TV. It can be hard to find as it is out of print on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get a dvd from ebay of less than 8 bucks! Cool flick.
