This is one of the movies you do across when you can surf on a Saturday afternoon and you are drawn into it and end up seeing it all. I thought it was well-acted and it really made me feel the signs. Although it is a bit slow to move and focus more on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it never became boring. We don't really see too much of all the robberies they were so legendary to, and instead most of the sliders find themselves when they are hit by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with his character. Going from a lovely country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray and I enjoyed the subtlety she led to the role. All in all, an above average effort was made, especially considering that it was a made for television movie.
