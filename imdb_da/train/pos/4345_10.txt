It is no wonder that this film won 4 awards, it is a movie that lends itself to every soul, it is not why it took Paul Reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it, it's a movie that makes you cry just a tear or thousands. <br /> <br /> When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife stating that she is leaving him to find something else, his son and he goes out on a road trip to find her and while doing so, finds they have something lost, friendship, family and love for each other. In the beginning, you know what is going to happen, but no one, regardless of the story is not so easy to figure out from the beginning to the end, it's a trip between a father and his son, a man and his wife. It is no wonder that it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can't say anything else what to say, hi it's with Peter Falk in that he is a playful all he does in movies is magic when you uses Peter Falk in a romance / comedy, what do you think you get? A perfect result, it is no wonder that this movie is the perfect one and won so many awards. When his son Paul Reiser does an excellent job, it does not mean that this did not work, even though he is not a great actor. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect father and son, the rest of the throw is good enough, but you do not see them so much, just imagine that they do what they need to make this shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It doesn't always work when you use music at times, it just doesn't fit, but it's not something in this movie, the music is perfect in tune, it makes the movie even more convincing. This part of the movie will shine as well as the other parts, a good soundtrack to a Romance / Comedy that surely. <br /> <br /> General: 10/10 There are so many Romance / Comedy movies out on tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and what not, but this movie is one of the special. It does not happen every day that you can make a story like this, it takes years to think about this, and that is actually what is required to do it, a big piece to be bought and kept in the human soul, see when you grow old and see it with your father in an old age, I think this movie will rub as no one else ever made.
