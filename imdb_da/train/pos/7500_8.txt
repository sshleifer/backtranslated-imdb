If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is fun, you won't be disappointed with THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary have many of Yankovic's more memorable videos ("As a Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are interwoven with funny vignettes, which apparently highlight the parody's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for everyone, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be easily entertained. Die-hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look at Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love the fun pictures.
