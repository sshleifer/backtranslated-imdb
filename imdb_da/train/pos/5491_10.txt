Although we know how the story ends, it is a gripping fly-on-the-wall movie that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger than life-mate, who has an unbreakable connection with mestizos, who make up 80% of the population, but who have previously been closed by Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. He acts as devoted to those whom they are to him. He travels the country at a frantic pace, reaches out to campesinos, accepts large crowds, hugs and kisses ordinary people, accepts letters on paper sheets and hears help. People are happy that one of their number has made it the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that changes for the better, coming to the festering barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The pure-blood-castillian Spanish elite, who is a small minority but who has previously controlled all wealth, is full of bitterness and anger. One of the most unintentional hilarious moments in the movie is when an Ann Coulter lookalike at a resident's meeting in an exclusive gated community complains of mestizos, "they have no concept of battle or sacrifice." Minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting to "take care of your servants - they could be Chavez supporters." You h! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In a Sennat interview alone with the movie staff, Chavez reveals some of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive, poetic person, but with a confusion, even clown-like, sense of humor (as we saw when he approached the UN and called the Bush Devil.) <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to gather power as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change the last minute route and march on the presidential palace, knowing that it is surrounded by Chavez supporters, and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls in place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire at Chavez supporters, some of whom are burning back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that Chavez supporters are massacring protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protests took another route. Needless to say, the footage of the empty street was edited by the refined anti-Chavez private television stations (which had a constant burst of propaganda that mentally called Chavez and sexually fixed on Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup We see Ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly afterwards watching how they had manipulated the situation with ruthless disregard for each other's lives and supporters. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic, fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chavez eventually ceases to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to step back and is whisked away to an offshore island where an airplane is waiting to take him - where? USA? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid arresting and defeating this heavily armed conspiracy of right wing generals and extremely wealthy businessmen closely associated with the Bush administration? Watch movies and find out! <br /> <br /> If you only know Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the US media, then you know nothing. He is not an "unpopular tyrant" and "does not rule by decree" - he is hugely popular, has been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of votes (something George Bush Junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in the ordinary Venezuelan people are ultimately the reason why the coup fails. <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skill of the filmmakers is to be discreet and let the story unfold through Venezuelan voices at all levels from the barrio to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and the confusion of which a coherent whole arises and moves. Don't miss out!
