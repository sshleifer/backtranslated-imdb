Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. It's also Uttara Baokar, which is usually excellent in most of its roles. Along with Kairee, it is an example of the Marathi cinema at best. There are certain parts of both films that tend to doactics - it would probably have improved the film for not having the few scenes in which the social message is hammered. and move enough to not use it. But apart from such small quibbles, it's a movie that deserves to be seen more, and one I highly recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through.
