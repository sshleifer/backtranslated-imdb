Since the day I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. The author I wrote to Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it finally comes out on DVD on the 10/17/06 movie's 25th anniversary. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this movie explains its appeal - "Thanks to people in Manhattan on whose island it was filmed." A charming and feminine romantic comedy, it's a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every single location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, Old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits who was a country & western club). You get the impression that the whole ensemble casts the click as well on the screen as they do, and this intimacy is clearly conveyed. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature look (she had a cameo after this movie) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make a big pot of popcorn and curl up with someone you love.
