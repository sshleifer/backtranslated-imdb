This is a very light comedy about a wonderful family who has a son called Pecker because he is using for Peck on his food. Pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of Baltimore, MD, and manages to get the attention of a group of New York City artists. Pecker has a sweet sister who simply goes nuts over sugar and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men who exhibit the lumps of their jockey with grinding movements and gals do pretty much the same. It is quite difficult to keep an eye on the edge of this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie that gives you a few laughs on a simple picture made in 1998.
