The men can slave over Lollo if they like (or her lollipops - she named her a snake condition for breasts in French), but the ladies have an even better meal in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. Do not be discouraged if your version has no subtitles because in this simple, exciting story of love and war, where everything is fair, they are not necessary. All you need to know is that Lollobrigida at the beginning of the film reads Philip's palm and tells him he will marry the king's daughter. Then the story is quite clean from the Gallic movements and races, jumps and swords. <br /> <br /> On the minus side, the obvious nature of the story and the heavy devotion of the tone are somewhat tiring, and it is annoying that the French seem to consider themselves superior to Hollywood to embarrass themselves trying the plausibility of its exciting stunts. And of course, the non-French speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la, like: Virtual Girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I was interested in the trifle?
