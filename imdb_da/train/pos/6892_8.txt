The closest I ever saw this was a clip shown at a Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in remake and had just got the original just over half a century after it was made. I can only conclude that the creepy fence was intentionally aimed at a long obsolete goal. Hollywood had made realistic sword fighting since the 30s, when the biggest of them all, Basil Rathbone, crossed foils with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and so it only left satire. After a while, you do not notice and delight in the Henri Jeanson dialogue, reminiscent of the Prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence of a role like this, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a bit better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at that time. The phrase I saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely, so maybe a DVD version would improve it.
