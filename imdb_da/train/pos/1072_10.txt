I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story line though a few improvements were required was quite good, especially in season 1. However, Season 2 became more of a freak show and lost DANS original charm. Season a story line was more interesting, a bright side to life on Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the X series. I was looking forward to new seasons, in fact I am still. I hope FOX guys and DA production crew realize that a lot of ppl are still waiting for DA to make a comeback. Even after 2 years of being canceled, DA can do it big if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should face the challenge.
