Who doesn't want to go on a road trip with Peter Falk? The guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of fun and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterweight to all bombastic special effects drilled. Women will love it for all wake up romance advice for men, and men will love it for their spot-on father / son character study - a great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Of course, it is a love work for Paul Reiser who understands how to be both a father and a son, and having both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part, however, was to see Travel watch Falk. You could tell that both his character came to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow who really enjoys Peter Falks special craft. Really lovely. Let's hope this movie makes it theaters around the country sometime soon, so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Travel and people.
