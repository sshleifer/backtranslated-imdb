It's bad, many people didn't understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But funny! ill explain it to you :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. The first part is Tony's "Dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now, what people didn't understand is that Ton's dream is more than just a dream. In this episode, it's about his preparation for his death. He loses his own identity and eventually forgets himself, so he interrupts all his bonds with this world. You will notice what I say in the medical field, where Tony says he has lost his briefcase containing "his life". The makers really did a great job of interpreting their own thoughts on what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you find this and the next episode a unique thing with great spiritual meanings. Like any soprano episode, the play and the movie are amazing. <br /> <br /> Only thing I didn't understand was the role of the monks. I'll probably see it again until I get it. <br /> <br /> Yet, this episode has really touched me, and I don't think others can get a better picture of what's happening in an almost death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
