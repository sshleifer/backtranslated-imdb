First thing I never even became afraid of this underrated gem as a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other side ...). As my title says, this was one of my fav childhood films that I still love as a teenager. It's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a misfit German shepherd called Charlie (fantasticaly pronounced by Burt Reynolds), killed by his boss / partner in crime (is the name ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent to heaven by default because "all dogs go to heaven because, unlike humans, dogs are obviously good and loyal and friendly." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he phased out his life clock, entering into even more evil with his best friend, Itchy and a little orphan, Anne-Marie. I used to see this all the time as a child, and I still see it at times. Anyways, it's a beautiful bittersweet movie that I said before that might just leave a tear in the eye ...
