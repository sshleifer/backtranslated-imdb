Paul was completely ripped off by someone who primarily made Dave. It's the same story, not so much fun. <br /> <br /> Paul is related to me this morning about the scene, where sammy davis sings the parador's new national anthem. he arrived in Brazil after a long flight from vegas, three planes, car ride to the set etc. he was beat. he could hardly stand, had to use a stick. He lived in a trailer about the size of my bathroom. He didn't know he could. Then he saw the amount of 6,000 extras, paid 7 bucks. He came to life and they shot that scene for two hours. he was magnificent and then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a good guy, even though he is very liberal. a real talent.
