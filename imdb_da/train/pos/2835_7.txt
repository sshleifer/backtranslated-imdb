Thanks to the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that I only paid US $ 1.4 and I could have such a surprisingly delightful pleasure. <br /> <br /> Violation? How common in our modern days. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to hunt for Luis and Charlotte for Italy. She wants her revenge finished, but at the end she also commits herself to the same crime Luis: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this little indie production, Vivian Naefe treated the thought problems of modern marriage with a light heart. How can you cultivate marriage seriously during this fast-food time, where people now have higher physical, mental and technological mobility? Conjugal commitment requires too high a price that most people would choose to undermine. Nick once relied on Charlotte, but he fell to Eva after kidnapping a journey that forced him to experience great growth. Most viewers can feel happy about the end because Eva and Nick get together, yes, it should be the greatest retribution for their spouses' cheating But I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would evolve after this exchange. Maybe they can switch back, how can one be so sure of the appalling love affair. <br /> <br /> Good acting and good nature. The two small children's actors should not be neglected, especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in Venice. And of course, how can we forget the city's "bella, bella" landscape.
