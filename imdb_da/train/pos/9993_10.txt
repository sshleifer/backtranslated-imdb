The most hillarious and fun Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can see and watch the tape 100 times again. I laugh my ** and I cry for a few moments. It's really good and fun movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionaire) comes to the streets as homeless for 30 days to win the entire poor district from his competitor. Reality bites, but ultimately it's about people's warm relationship ... Hightly recommend!
