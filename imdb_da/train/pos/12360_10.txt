I loved the movie. it beautifully analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society, how the left-wing of the 70s has abandoned all their ideals and comes to a happy scheme that they do not want disturbed. For example, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time, you wanted to buy the video after watching the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have disappeared completely from the market, even in Italy nobody knew in the bookstores about the movie. a big shame. <br /> <br /> The one sex scene that everyone seems to be doing doesn't hurt the movie.
