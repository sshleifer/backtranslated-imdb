My very favorite character in movies, but in almost all of them, Zorro's character has a little bit of cloth like a mask, and if the villain can't tell who is under the cloth, then they are daring. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Zorro's Fighting Legion" (Series 1939), the mask fills its entire face, making it a true mystery about who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But yet Zorro is one of the best characters in movies and to get it updated. I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. My interest in movies is great, but I have a really good taste for the serial number in the 30s / 40s. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
