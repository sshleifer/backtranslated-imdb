This, despite not being the original - it began life as a game in Central Europe - has weathered the many incarnations that followed (MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show, she loves myself the excellent theater revival in Paris for a few years ago) and remains the final version and the one they all have to beat. Several former commentators have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable, not least being the predominant way in the 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavish attention and details on ensemble games rather than just two leaders like that so often today - try, for example, removal of Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes, you will still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo, but they just wanted to be frosting without the rich cake mix below. Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leaders, but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden, and that is BEFORE we factor in the Lubitsch 'touch'. Okay, maybe they were a bit more naive, innocent even in that juror, but how many real movie lovers sitting with scatology, screwing and in-your-face sex, return to the days of stories, style, slenderness and skill and wallow in big movies like this one. By far the best thing about this technological age is not the CSI but the DVD that at one time can make these classics available for nostalgia and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it.
