There have been countless talking animal films in the past, most of which either have the animal's mouth digitally animated to almost matching voice-acting or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is also not. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the infant-like addition of moving dog lips or gesticulate cat legs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals speak authentically with each other and you can feel more emotionally attached to them (like all the big boy-and-dog dogs should). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal pants for me and boasts a beautiful filmography, an inspirational soundtrack (from Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (Voice God) ... Various <br /> <br /> It is a modernized version of the children's classic fiction 'The Incredible Journey', which was made for a semi-documentary by Disney long ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Francisco) Not as good as a movie, but expanding the adventure with my favorite bird-friends, is a fun city-twist on the great outdoor adventure theme. Do you want to entertain your children with a witty, beautiful, heartfelt mini-epic, without the idiotic and often completely ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thanks, Disney, for getting a tear to my eyes every time I see this early 90's classic!
