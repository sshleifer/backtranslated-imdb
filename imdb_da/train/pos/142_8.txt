The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish TV series is slightly inferior to the first, but also has lots of laughs and scares. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the monster child and his demon-like father. Other standout parts this time are Søren Pilmarks Doctor Krogshoj, who will face Dr. Helm's terrible revenge, and once again, patient tries to froze. Drowning to solve the mysteries, Miss Marple style. Ending on a cliffhanger and after the deaths of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse) you wonder how they will ever be able to do part III, but I hope that Von Trier will give it a shot . Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Down's Syndrome dishwasher no. 2 died shortly after. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
