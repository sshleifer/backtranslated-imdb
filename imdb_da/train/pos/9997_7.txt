Life Stinks (1991) was a step below Mel Brook's other productions. He stars as a rich man who pay a crazy effort with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live as a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual effort. During his stay in Bowery he meets a bunch of countless homeless, one of whom captures his fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They discover a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned while living in the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive on their own without the luxury of being filthy rich? Will he win this unorthodox effort? Who are his true friends? Find out when you see LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie has been unjustified. Sure it's not a classic like his previous movie, but it's still fun. I liked the way Mel Brooks pays tribute to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you have seen Chaplin's previously silent movie, then you also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
