This is a documentary, I came by chance on the British TV channel More4, and I have to say that I found it very interesting and thought-provoking. I will also find out the book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically, it is Professor Jared Diamond's theory why certain parts of the Earth's community flourished and others did not. The argument he presented was new to me and argued how the happiness of the right crops and the real animals that could count was certainly a convincing one. With regard to the documentary itself, it is well shot and well told with not too much of the restored scenes that destroy many a modern documentary. Diamond also helps by not being discouraging, which is a mistake of many intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. People have claimed that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy this and see it more socio-geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory of social development that was not based on religion. Recommended view.
