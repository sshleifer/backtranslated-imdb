Who would think Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But it is just one of several strange and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenager-fighting-creatures movie that might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Know What From The Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" was less pricy), a good boy with just as much interest; The very healthy, yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough since their date was disturbed by teenage hot-rodders, but they are significantly more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating What is it that rides on the ground on its own hotrod meteor - and begins to gobble up townspeople right and left. But will the adults believe them? Of course not, what do they know they are just kids! <br /> <br /> The movie is teeny bopper on his teeny bopping best. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously with the eyes of many soulful peoples in view, and the "adult" support casting says enough "Kids!" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the movie is its creature, which is well-imagined, well-executed and often manages to create a surprising degree of excitement. And although it's clearly on the cheap side (check out these miniature sets, guys!), BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie - and it's the captivating little theme song that is thrown in for good. The 40-plus crowd (even included) will enjoy the movie as a nostalgia, but it does not prevent them from running alongside the younger set of its full-milk-and-white 1950s sensitivity, and the movie would be a good choice for either family movie or a more sophisticated "adult only" come together. Make lots of Jello dice for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
