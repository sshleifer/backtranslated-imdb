"Hope of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope that spirals down despair as they travel to Switzerland to seek prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning movie is pretty well designed, it lacks substance and has many implausibilities. Much of the movie's 1.7 hour run is on the bus, got out of the bus, got on the boat, got off the boat, got into the habit, got out of the habit, etc.; time that could have been better spent or omitted altogether. History has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have an awareness of common crime in dealing with illegal immigrants. A valuable and reasonably entertaining watch but over-rated.
