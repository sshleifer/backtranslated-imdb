I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience turned out to be a little anti-liming. However, Alec Guiness energetically leads to a wonderful cast in a jolly whose formula penetrates through industrial post-WWII England. <br /> <br /> This is the well-known tale of the horror of perceiving the perfect everyday product. Remember the car running on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a substance that does not wear out, wrinkles or even becomes dirty! Of course, the fabric manufacturers and their workers are appalled at the prospect of being knocked out of service and then the plot becomes a bit thick. Guiness makes the whole business worthwhile, and seeing him blow up a factory research lab over and over is completely blast! (The Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when they are on fire.) The movie can chug together exactly like Guiness's greasy invention, but it's a good trip anyway.
