This 1935 picture went away with all kinds of Ocars for Best Director, John Ford, Actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out The Marines," 42, gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a hard and hard crowd, all struggling for a cause while becoming poorer and poorer with plenty of drink . Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend to take a trip with his gal to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary", 43, gave a great support role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was eager to capture the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan is haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful play by McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the movie.
