** SPOILERS ** Very police charged drama about a serial killer losing in and around the small town of Riverside Wisconsin. Who is being tracked by the local police by police officer Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt, as an undercover decoy to catch him. <br /> <br /> No new in this made for television movies that you haven't seen before, but the depth of the play is exceptionally good and brings a lot about not only the killer but the policeman as her fellow police officer, state of mind. <br /> <br /> Having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable attacker who attacked her partner with a rifle. Officer Palusky gets the job to go undercover to get close to murder suspect Kayle Timler, Steven Webber. After he was positively identified by the little girl Sahsa, Kim Kluznick, who didn't see him far from where little Timmy Curtis was found, 18 times to death the next day. <br /> <br /> Getting a job at Mr. "C" Diner where Tim works, Gina gets very kind with him and tells him later to get Tim open that he might be the serial killer she once killed in a hit-and-run accident a 79 year old old woman. <br /> <br /> Tim, who is said to have a genius IQ, does not seem to pick up Gina's attempt to trap him, even when he later sees her on a bowling alley with his colleagues who spend an evening. To play a strange cat and mouse game with her Tim at some point, get Gina, at the knife point, to admit she's wired. But Gina tells him she was forced to do so by the police for a break and early release from prison. Besides Tim's instability and criminal actions, we find out that Gina is not all there too. She seems to suffer from being rejected by her father who left her with a drunk and abusive mother as a young girl performing her job as an undercover policeman. <br /> <br /> There is also the fact that Gina's beloved policeman Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who is abandoned from his wife and two children who are also in the serial killer, is too overprotected by her. It almost made Gina blow her cover, and later her task was taken by her. <br /> <br /> Put back on the undercover duty of his boss Capt. Cheney (Dan Conway), over Commissioner McCaid's objections, after another young boy, 12-year-old Davy Marish, was found murdered, finally gave Gina herself together and allowed Tim to admit that he is the person responsible for the range of murders in the area. Gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaces the one she gave him to show how honest she is, hidden on her. <br /> <br /> The movie "In The Darkness Company" wasn't really that unusual, but the actor of Helen Hunt Jeff Fahey and especially Steven Webber was. It was these high caliber performances that raised the movie well above the average made for television movies were used to watch.
