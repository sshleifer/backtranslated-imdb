I think this show is scary fun! It's not for everyone's taste and I don't want to raise or disturb the people who don't. I'm sure they are wonderful bright people who operate on a different wavelength. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named "Sarah Silverman", who often finds herself in homeric predicaments (it's "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). I remember Sarah Silverman from her short concert Saturday Night Live in the early 90s. I liked her right away and I go out of my way to check everything she's done. <br /> <br /> This show is fun on your food and wet pants fun. Therefore, I always hold fast before you see it and wear adult diapers. Check it out!
