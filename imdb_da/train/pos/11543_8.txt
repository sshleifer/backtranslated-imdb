Neil Simon has quite a large part of the work, but it is the odd couple who bore him fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a good chemistry. Support for this movie is also star. <br /> <br /> It's about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The scripture bursts with humor from this situation. This had happened in some forms earlier. This is the one that brings it together in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon has done some other decent work, but this is really his best work that made the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine that Simon has ever peaked this.
