This is a great movie, it shows what our government wants to other countries if we don't like their government. It's not as bad as Reagan and Bush number one made to South America, but the US still has no business music with other countries like this. This film also shows that US media radiate government propaganda. This is exactly what they did with Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez failed was Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political documentary, it would still be a good movie if it was a drama, it is amazing that this is right. The other reviewer is lying when he says "Chavez tackles the airwaves". The private media are constantly running anti-Chavez propaganda.
