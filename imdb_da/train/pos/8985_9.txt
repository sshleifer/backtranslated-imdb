Although DiG! was hailed as being closest to what the music industry is as it is heavily fabricated. The director has misled the audience to believe that the Brian Jonestown massacre disappeared from the ground after '98. And the rivalry between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this movie. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is infinitely quotable and is an interesting watch when we look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best things this movie is about to make is a unique perspective between the Indian music scene and the larger corporate scene. Most recommended for the music and the two fantastic bands.
