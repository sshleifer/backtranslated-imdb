The best martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee has ever done. A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts films and the true king of kung fu. It's a great shame that while Bruce Lee had been so overstated, it took Jackie Chan forever to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie Rules !!!!
