I happened to see this movie randomly some days ago while flipping channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie. In 'A Guy Thing' Jason Lee Paul, a straight-laced, Seattle-based guy to marry his fiance Karen (Selma Blair) and settle for a challenging middle-class life. We first meet Paul at his bachelor party, where he does not want to engage in any of the normal bachelor party activities that his (surprisingly few) friends encourage if he is a little naughty and in need of him soon are in trouble and strife. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that Karen is coming over. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). From this little increase of potential problems, a mighty oak grows with frenetic misfortune as Paul scrabbles from a creepy adventure to try to cover up what he has done, while appearing to be a devout, family-oriented good guy is super-excited at his upcoming wedding. His efforts to secure Karen remain nobody who is wiser about any potentially wrong action on his part, strengthens Paul closer and closer to the fun-loving Becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life there seems to have been mapped to him. The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a watch.
