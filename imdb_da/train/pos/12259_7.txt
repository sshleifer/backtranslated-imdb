"A family affair" takes us back to a less complicated time in America. It is sober to see how different things were back then. It was a more innocent era in our country and we see a "functional" family trade in things together. The film also marks the start of the series with the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The movie, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful game. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily face a domestic crisis to be dealt with. Married daughter Joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home to a beau that is ready to clash with her father. The happy teenager Andy seems to be the only one without problems until his mother makes him escort Polly to the dance, something he is reluctant to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best when he makes a plan to get everyone back together. He is a man who understands not only the law, but how to handle the outside forces that threaten his standing in society and what will make his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small role in this movie, but he's always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also in the movie as Aunt Milly and Polly, the girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> A family affair is a great way to observe our past through the positive image painted by an American family.
