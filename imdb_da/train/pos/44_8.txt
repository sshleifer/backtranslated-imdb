When I learned about this movie, I thought it would be another chick flick. I was mistaken. This movie sends a strong message to judge others. I was deeply moved. I have recommended this movie to everyone I have encountered. No one has come back and said it was bad. Obsessed, also did a good job with his role in this movie. I don't know much about her acting career, but wow, the way she took the end of this filling was great. In the beginning it was a little slow. But after she went to the hospital .... wow, the movie is recording again. I have no idea why this movie has not been talked about in the film world. I wish this movie was released again and announced more ... because it sends a strong message about just an hour and a half.
