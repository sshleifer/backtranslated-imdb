The movie "MacArthur" begins and ends with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata US Military Academy for West Point on the Hudson. We see a fragile 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur giving introductory speech to the 1962 graduate class on what an honor it is to serve their country. The film then goes into a nearly two-hour long feedback on the gene. MacArthur's brilliant as well as controversial career, starting in the darkest hours of World War II on the besieged island of Corregid in the Philippines in early spring 1942. <br /> <He told to leave his island for Australia before the Japanese military invaded the. Gen. MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost does not break a direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Sensing that he will leave his men at their greatest hour's needs, MacArthur reluctantly made his wife and young son reluctantly what he was told to get him to haunt him for a reminder of the war. That was the reason for his escape from the death or captivity of Japanese who drove MacArthur's genes to use all his influence to get FDR two years later to launch a great invasion of the Filipinos instead of the island of Formosa to back up his promise For both the Philippine people as well as the thousands of American pows ​​left behind. That he will return and return with the power of the US Army and Navy to back up his promise! In the two years leading up to the invasion of the Philippine Islands, Gen. MacArther the Japanese forces in the Southern Palatinate in a series of brilliantly conceived hop-ups that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops for surrender. The General made the suffering far less US military loss and then any other ally commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> In 1950/51, in the Korean War, Gen. MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. After exploring the progressive North Korean army in the brilliant and perfectly accomplished, with the invading US mariners suffering less than 100 accidents, back door or left hook invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther's feeling invincible sent the US / UN forces under his command to the very border along the Yalu River, by the communist red China. Told his subordinates that he is facing the threat of a massive land attack by communist Chinese troops. Gen. MacArthur nevertheless pressed for this attack to cut the United States and the United Nations forces. The unstoppable wave of wave of attacking red Chinese forces forced the US / UN forces to retire in the "Big Bug Out" of 1950 with their lives and left all their equipment back across the North Korean border even to abandon the South Korean capital of Seoul! This turned out to be one of the greatest military disasters in American history with the US forces losing a record in the Korean War, 1,000 lives on the very first day-November. 29/30 1950-by the Communist Chinese invasion! <br /> <br /> Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, mostly due to his own arrogance, MacArthur did not go on the offensive against the advancing communist Chinese and non-choral forces but his own commander and chief president. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in him who has no excitement or courage to do what is needed: Start a full scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from exceeding the Korean Peninsula! For pressure. Truman, who had taken almost enough waste from the gene. MacArthur in him, runs his mouth publicly in how he mistreated the war as he did not go out as MacArthur wanted him to, against the Red Chinese was the last straw! April 11, 1951, pres. Truman Revived Unusual Gen. MacArthur from his command as chief commander of the United States / United Nations forces in Korea! Pressure. Truman's brave but very unpopular decision by not joining MacArthur's overall war strategy prevented a Third World War from breaking out with Soviet Union Communist China's allies - which at that time - like the United States - had the atomic bomb! Pressure. Truman's controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls so low in the mid-20s that he retired in March of that year - from the US presidential campaign! <br /> <br /> You were Gen. MacArthur's misfortune to be around as the political and military climates of the world changed in how to make future wars. With a terror of nuclear war now in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like gene. MacArthur wanted to touch the red Chinese with a nuclear holocaust that would cease not only the US Soviet Union and the Red China but the whole world! It was the important reality of the future war that the gene. MacArthur was never taught when the A and H bombs had not yet been invented in West Point. <br /> <br /> Back to 1962, we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after completing his initial speech at West Point, became both an older and wiser soldier and since his retirement from the US military, eldest statesman in his sense of war and complete in vain. One thing, like the gene. MacArthur was taught at an early age, from his civil war's general father Douglas MacArthur Sr, who stuck to him throughout his life was that a soldier like himself should be war that should be the very first non-first resort in settling problems between nations . Thus, it is the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, that the gene. MacArthur finally realized how right and wise his father was a congressional medal of honorary wives he himself was!
