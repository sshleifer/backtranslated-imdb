I give ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely smashed, stunned and dazed by the whole picture, amazing games by Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the entire crew, amazing plot ... Just look into yourself and pick your courage to admit - it touched your soul because it's strange , but there are all the answers you've ever been looking for ... The very best, Mr. Ritchie! The very best ever. Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish continue to shout they are disappointed. But there are lots of superficial movies in Hollywood today, you can't remember what it was about the next day you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly expect to be able to portray a clear and ingenious picture of myself by anyone who should see it. Absolutely unbeatable, astonishing, dazzling ... You can gain insight into this, I have no doubt about it. In fact, no word can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a movie after many years of horrified Hollywood waste we had seen. Thanks from the whole heart, it is simply the best.
