I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish errors. Apart from that, this movie is one of my favorites! It is entertaining to say the least. However, the shooting scenes are ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little too much of his "Matrix obsession" into it. It seems that their enemies are just standing there waiting to be shot. But this film touches and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of good humor in it, so it makes me laugh too. Gackt is a great actor I have to say .. he shows so much emotion. This was Hyde's first time, and he did it okay. The role fits him. Wang Lee Hom is amazing. The whole cast is what I wanted to say, perfect for this movie. DON'T MISS IT! YOU Rule IT!
