Aside from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette is the mining politician, Jack La Rue as "weak" Italian and of course James Lee as "The Chinese Cook", the movie that is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room. For a movie from the early 1930s, this step by step resembles "peeling the mystery veneer", as the COLUMBO series, except in this movie, does not have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
