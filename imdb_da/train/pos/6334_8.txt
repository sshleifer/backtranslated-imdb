This movie has some things that are pretty amazing. First, it must be based on a true story. It is amazing in itself that more tornadoes would hit the same city in the autumn of Nebraska. I wonder if the real city's name was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the city's name in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the place where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV is unclear is actually based. Before the Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned the TV to a particular channel (not on cable) and set the brightness just right, you could know if there was a tornado coming. The problem was that you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Knowing about midwest tornadoes made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a tube in a wellhouse.
