It was like the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare, it was meant to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel !! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history !! The upswing in the economy and a reemergence in basic American values ​​cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence, which was considered by the American people with a very promising disposition! There have been many replacements of classic films in the past, but the originals are almost always considered superior !! "Little Rain" is such a movie in this category !! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" gave a hundred hundred in the eighties, fortunate good quality music they incorporated into this excellent movie !! Some artifacts suggesting the 80s are actually classics !! Screwball comedies, neon-acclaimed clothes and of course the music !! 80s music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history !! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" included the use of naive entertainment with the city's changing times. When I was a young child, I lived in Minneapolis for approx. eight months, when the non-white population was below 3% !! In 1984, African Americans had made some on their way to Minneapolis, and so they also established a solidly embedded culture of their own !! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes a clothes-style clothing and music ensemble that effortlessly captures the film's audience !! I loved the music of "Purple Rain" and the innovative approach this movie takes to confrontational success is actually brilliant !! Watch this movie if you haven't seen it already !! Prince became a eighty icon with this masterpiece !! For a short time he dated Kim Bassinger, he must do something right !! "Little Rain" put Prince on the map !! This movie gets my emphatically alleged judgment of THUMBS UP !!!!
