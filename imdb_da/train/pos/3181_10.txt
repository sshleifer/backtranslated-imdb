I had the opportunity to watch this movie debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, where it won a prize for Best Picture. This movie is superbly done with an excellent cast that acts as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also some amazing effects with virgins and cockroaches that I was surprised to find that this movie was made on a small budget. The author-director Adam Jones, whom I believe also won a prize for his writing, does an excellent job of direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.
