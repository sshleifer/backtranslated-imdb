Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are a big part of a large selection of horror movies. This one has many. But it is Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, just too predictable. And what horror movies don't have stupid people? This one is crowded with retarded victims who almost just beg their lives to be taken. Pet Semetary I seemed to be scary. The way everything was created was really scary but not scary. For the most part, the actor SOMEWHAT was credible, the excitement was not so exciting, but the entertainment level was set to a high rank; My eyes were almost glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans should watch this movie, but as for everyone else, expect an OKAY thriller.
