"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "disease" photography. It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its spread of "style over matter" I couldn't disagree more with. I think "Domino" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant Hollywood action movie state in the late 80s and early 1990s, Tony Scott has gradually moved closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as "Crimson Tide", Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama associated with the onboard nuclear submarine was crafted in the excellent use of long lenses combined with Dutch angular framing. This was then accomplished for "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a movement in an expressionist more picturesque aesthetic. Here Scott used an outdated handcuffed camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage. Although not entirely successful, they introduced the techniques that would find their full expression in "Domino". Couched in the framing unit of an FBI interrogation "Domino" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter through her story of incoherent fragments of memory. She tackles the memories we all do - in fragments, flashes and short snatches. When Domino relays his story verbally, Scott relays it visually, and not only illustrates the events she describes, but also the point of view that leads them. She has "traces of mescalin" in her system, but her individual vision is still unusual - it is a woman who scared the luxury of life for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> That's when Domino begins to relate to the events leading to her captivity, which Scott really lets go. Together with the film photographer Dan Mindel and the composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a post-modern canvas of modern Americana. Gradually, we begin to realize that, even though she may be a Domino, unusual is no more than the "90210" culture she has rejected. As she waits through this cultural melange, Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence that it destroys through the underprivileged children the narrative introduces. In the end, Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this movie for being overly stylized, it is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing what is recognizable human. Like any great painting, the meaning of "Domino" is on the surface, and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not in any way connected to Scott Free, but have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
