Recently, a friend and I discussed educational and ethical influences as we grew up in the 1950s against today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. We had both been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in English literature courses in college. My friend said, "Its messages can even be called metaphysical within today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and only remembered bits and pieces. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so everybody could read it. It was easy enough, but I was very surprised to find it had been made into a movie. We were delighted to see the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly light reading. After each reading the poem, we saw the movie together. <br /> <br /> We saw the movie a remarkable achievement, especially considering that it was made in the 1970s before computers before the so-called Ken Burns effect, "and before special effects began to often compensate for Particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations deleted from "lesser-known artists", such as Willy Pogany, the early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The movie is told by Sir Michael Redgrave, who had learned the poem when he was a school leader, adding a power and credibility to remain true to the poem. <br /> <br /> Its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages, conveyed without "instruction" or becoming a repressive and overtly We found it such a refreshing change from today's 'in your face' and 'crawling over your head' mentality. Most of today's moral messages in movies are two-dimensional: Extreme violence, murder and chaos mark the bad. r really, really, bad, and good are superheroes. It's as if human character lacked any nuance. The Old Mariner's Rime is a celebration of the individual, of character, of recognition to celebrate all the wealth that life has to offer within the greater context of humanity, ie. human ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of ourselves to have found this "unknown" gem, we learned that it had won the top prize in its category five out of six times at "name" international film festivals. Another surprise was learning the film director, Raul daSilva, is a recognized early animation authority and authored six award-winning films on film. <br /> <br /> This movie's message is just as relevant today, if not more than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and then Raul daSilva translated it into movies. If I still learned high school as I did for five years, I would get it and show it to all my students. Here, there is wealth that naturally leads to discussion of the major and important problems we all face, either in 1798, 1978 or today - as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
