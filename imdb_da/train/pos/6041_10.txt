This is one to see a few times. The excellent writing shows that they should have lived this story or know someone who did because they nailed it. Freebird made me revive and laugh at my naughty youth. The title was a good choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker flick, but it would be a shame to pop the hole that way. Fun for the leg, like the Trailer Park Boys in the United States. If you have never seen TPB, please note if you like this movie. You want to thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Sequel? Could be done. There is a lot more of the world I would like to see through their eyes.
