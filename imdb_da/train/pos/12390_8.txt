Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later by TV's "Flamingo Road") as a beautiful but slightly unstable model with a beautiful smile slated to pay for her attempt at suicide by guarding Gateway to Hell! The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's companion, but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), it really starts to cook . The kids, including a fantastic evil burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a devilish mass, and Eli Wallach is fun as a wild political detective. The film is almost a cross pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the best seller by Jeffrey Konvitz, "The Sentinel" is entertaining spooky, full of shock that was brought by good by director Michael Winner, who maintains a thought-provoking downbeat ending with skills. *** 1/2 from ****
