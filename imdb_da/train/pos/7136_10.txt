I watched the movie before I read Michelle Magorian's book and I enjoyed both. The film, more than the book, made me come close to tears on several occasions. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. I encourage so many people to see this masterpiece as much and as quickly as possible. I give it ten stars.
