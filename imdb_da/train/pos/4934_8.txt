"Panic in the Streets" is a rather unknown little film by director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947 before this film, so he was not a completely unknown at that time. Still "Panic in the Streets" is mostly a film that passes under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning script. It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime / movie noir elements. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. The cast is rather unknown (especially at the time it was released), but it still contains Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles. Especially Palance impresses as the hard gangster boss, with a very powerful-looking face. <br /> <br /> Setting the movie a little on some points. The movie starts very well, but after the start, the film slowly goes down and does not always take the right decisions with regard to tempo and the point of view from which the story is told. <br /> <br /> However, "Panic in Streets" remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly because of its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the movie a credible one to watch. For fans of the thriller genre, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
