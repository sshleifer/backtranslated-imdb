Lars Von Trier's Europe is a very good movie. What is it like? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he was with Europe. For me, the whole movie was an experience, even though I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, this movie is, in my opinion, the most complete, REAL and floating cinema, so most of the movies on the top 250 list. I also think it is perhaps the scary, most gothic and complete movie around. Okay, there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most demanding scenes ever.
