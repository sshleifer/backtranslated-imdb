I have passed several times to see this when I figured it was something stupid, juicy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not too sentimental as it is about themes for office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that holds your interest, and not everything turns out exactly as you expected. But there is enough white and charm to touch the most invited cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, you seriously look at how well you want to know them.
