Moe and Larry are newly hanging husbands having married Shemp's demanding sisters. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries anyone himself! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a remake of the 1947's "Brideless Groom", which many consider as one of the best Stooge movies with Shemp. Remake contains most of the footage from that movie. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, include the great Moe and Larry married Shemp's sisters along with their cooking of turkey twisted turpentine! A few new scenes are also dressed at the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green was used, if you blink, you will miss the double look.) <br /> <br /> "House Beware" would have made for a good movie with just the plot line to marry the sisters. Budget considerations combined with fewer bookings for two-wheeled comedies have affected the decision to use older footage. Although brand new films are still produced by Stooges, most of their 1955-56 releases consisting of older films with a few new scenes were thrown in. "Men watch out," while one of these hybrids is light and entertaining; We'll see most of the "bridal grooms" again, and the new scenes are fun enough to get the viewer through the movie. This movie is one of the last Stooge comedies to re-enact Shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
