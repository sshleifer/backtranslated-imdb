one of the funniest Mario's I've ever played. The levels are creative, which is fluid control and good graphics for its time. There are also a host of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you go out of some of the tough levels and still, you have to get more to fight with a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera's angle; Although it seems pretty good most, it can be a pain in some situations. if you are a great time mario fan; this for you. Even if you are not a big fan of him, I still recommend this one. It is a great game and getting what you need can take a while, but it is very satisfying. good to play in short time blasts. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it sure keeps mine!
