Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in the Ruins - showing it not too distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense. When you first turn off the premise that all modern technology can be stopped with the "pulse", it provides an entertaining landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two primary characters - Max (The Dark Angel / Bike Messenger) and Logan (the rich rebellion) ). It seems uneven, perhaps a result of a number of authors, but is held together by the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who both seems strong and is still called vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
