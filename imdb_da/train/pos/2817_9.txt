This review is the extended cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> I first saw Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I've always seen this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> It is said. I've always found the story a little confusing. The movie is after all a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Now in the extended version it is no longer so. The old "original" version begins with a large barrel-climb / rugby-like sequence, which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. The opening order is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to train and recite when his father is around. Other sequences have also been changed or extended in the expanded section and history makes much more sense when you see it. The pacing is also better and generally it only works better. It feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking why it ends as drastically and dramatically as the regular version does. <br /> <br /> I suggest anyone who is a Hong Kong cinema or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended. (Or at least I think it was meant. Why else would they do it and rearrange some of the scenes) When I was ready to see it, I felt like I had seen a whole new Jackie Chan movie, even whether most of the sequences were the same.
