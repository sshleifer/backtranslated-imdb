Wes Craven has created a most successful killer-thriller movie from all the time. After watching his movie, you will find your new fear. People do not know which Wes Craven's thriller movie is the best because they are all different. In this movie Lisa is terrorized by fellow travelers. He forces her to kill, and if she doesn't, Jack will kill his father. Lisa is in the big mess because she chooses to kill. <br /> <br /> It was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy acted incredibly well. The feelings were in the right choice. The idea and script in this movie is also fantastic ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminds of a "Scream", but he is definitely better than both "Screams" sequels together. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - this is the best killer-thriller movie of 21st century yet ...
