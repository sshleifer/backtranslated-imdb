I've seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favorite Stan and Ollie card. In this one is Stan and Ollie chimney sweep and get the job to clean the chimney at home with Professor Noodle Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle does crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause much chaos to try to clean the chimney and make a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a tank with a special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments, and it turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is where Ollie falls into the chimney and lots of bricks land upside down, but he doesn't seem to suffer much from this. <br /> <br /> Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their most fun. Fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
