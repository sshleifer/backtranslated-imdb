I recently purchased the complete American gothic series on DVD, and it lived up to my memories of it. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never televised. I loved the "Ring of Fire", especially the stories I hadn't seen the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is amazing as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a fantastic player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also fantastic in her portrayal. In fact, the whole cast was wonderfully talented and had great chemistry with each other. It's a pity that the series was turned off by the network (interacting with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was really designed for adult viewing. A mix of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genes, it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting on the genius level. <br /> <br /> I had the most amazing desire for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most delicious "fallen angel" ever.
