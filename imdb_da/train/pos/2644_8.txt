I don't know what I find so endearing about this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. The truth is being told, I haven't seen this movie for years, nor has it been shown on television for a while, but this movie is one of a man's odyssey after the pain of war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart-warming depiction of a man who is lost by his memories. There is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last fate of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality he is confronting. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
