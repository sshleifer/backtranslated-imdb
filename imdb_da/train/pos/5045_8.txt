The film is very complete in what it is, keeps one interested in flashbacks for childhood and grows up with such a bizarre father, and intersects it with tails of serial killer, one simply cannot go wrong. The plot itself, the film's history and essence are entertaining. That's the kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do with so much, and in that case he did a lot of it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you are expecting more and more about what's happening and where the movie goes, and the creativity behind that story is first class. I felt that this movie was exquisitely made from start to finish, and one of the rare gems that seemed to be without dull lulls - the action flowed nicely, quickly and closely from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: To make such dreadful things to their loved ones and to do evil acts in God's name when they become disillusioned as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its "phrases and takes on the concept of morality as a whole." All in all, it is the kind of movie you easily overlook, but I would recommend you not too and to check out this movie - it is so much worth your time.
