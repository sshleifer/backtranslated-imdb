In the periphery of São Paulo, the very low middle class dysfunctional and hypocritical Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and teenager Soninha (Silvia Lourenço) have deep secrets. The religious Teodoro is actually a hitman, employed to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). He has a lover, the very devoted woman Terezinha (Martha Meola), and he wants to regenerate, goes to the country with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who delivers meat to her father's slaughterhouse. Soninha is a common sixteen-year-old peripheral in the periphery, has active sexual life, smokes grass and loves heavy metal. When Julio is killed and neutered in their neighborhood, family members change. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is a great low-budget Brazilian movie that depicts life on the periphery of a large Brazilian city. The story is very real, using the usual elements of the poor areas of the big Brazilian cities (drug dealers, hit men, fanatical religious evangelical people, hopeless teens, etc.), have many plot points and a surprising end, and the characters have excellent performances that seems very natural and makes the story completely credible. The camera follows the characters, giving the movie a great dynamic. In the DVD's extras, director Roberto Moreira explains that his plays had no lines, only the description of the situations, and was partially revealed only a week before the start of the shootings. The actors have training in workshops and they used lots of improvisation, which is the reason for such a natural appearance. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against Everybody")
