Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", Sergio Leone's remake of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (proposed by the novel 'Red Harvest'). This one is strictly a B film; Taken like that, it's pretty comfortable. The direction is sharp, the spectacle full of enlistments, the limitations of its direct-to-video photography handled well. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry "fistful" / "yojimbo" plot to a part plot from Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West." "Fistful" and "West", his motivation behind the two films could no longer be different. The 'Man With No Name' (Eastwood) is a borderline socio course with a soft place for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed These two characters would not have had much to do with each other, to bring them together, 'Gun Crazy' had to twist that plot and complicate it until we lose track of what history we actually follows. <br /> <br /> But it's a B-Movie after all, and full of action and sadness, it's entertaining at that level, just don't expect anything more.
