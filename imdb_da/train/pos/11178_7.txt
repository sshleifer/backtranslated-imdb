MINOR SPOILER <br /> Underrated little Stephen King shocker. It's not perfect, in any way of imagination - even though Dale Midkiff's and Denise Croby's bad performances were better, there would still be the misunderstood mysterious story elements that had to contend with. The old Micmac burial ground, Rachel's terminally ill sister, and Jacob-Marley's Victor Pascow never really come together in anything coherent, and the movie in places feels confused and overstuffed. But getting horror movies is really perfect and what this may lack in other areas it poses in its will to shock. "Pet Sematary" can actually be one of the most horrible horror movies in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive depiction of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's free - and yet it causes us to make redundancies in a way that "safer" horror movies can never. Add to one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's witty direction, and you have a very satisfying scary movie - even with hokey ending. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10
