To say that, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I had heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how the life and attitudes of the Northern England working class were (as experienced by them), and this is an interesting portrayal that apparently represents what they told me. Especially the paternalistic but indulgent father who "knows" what is best for his family along with his stubbornness when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed then !!) People who have seen the game will probably be disappointed with the movie because the story is not easily transferred across the various media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document, and I personally enjoyed it, if only the way it conveyed a social phenomenon.
