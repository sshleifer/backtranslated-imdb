Sure, it was cheesy and obscene and sometimes corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. While most television films are bordered on the edge of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities for it. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows shades of Aragorn in a movie about a man who played according to his own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene of mountain life was intense. I was a little annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the movie as a rebellious shock jock, but then again it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona highlighted prominently in the movie.
