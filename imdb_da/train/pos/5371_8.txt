I wrote my first comment on this movie almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the film seemed to still be most fictitious if they could never even pass. Not anymore. Now, The Running Man's politics, society and media are very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year of The Running Man came out) that are present today: <br /> <br /> Worried about as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian puts it, "traditional morality". CONTROL <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort of participants. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. CONTROL <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens to government incursions, guided by a centralized computer system complete with coded passports ("travel passages" in the movie) and sanctioned under cover of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> Increased incestuous confusion by government and media. CONTROLS <br /> <br /> Computer generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate true movie footage (such as the "digital matting" of Ben Richards' stunt-double image). CONTROL <br /> <br /> Jailing of conscientious objectors or critics of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Flagging economy further expands the Gulf between the rich and the not so rich; Increasing number of fringe groups responding to the great government's tightening of civilian turmoil brews just below or on the surface of almost any significant public event regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. But to be sure, I move to Switzerland.
