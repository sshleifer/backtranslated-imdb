This is one of the best ensemble comedies / musical "B" movies I've seen (and since I'm in my 40's now and only see this now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the known ones movie out there). When there are a ton of actors who get their lead in minutes at a time, the comedy usually enters the musical bits, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comic stream. Call me in a crazy kind of atmosphere, but when I saw this at TCM Europe, I shot high with joy! So who delivered the laughs to me? Without a doubt Mischa Auer gave me some amazing gutbusting laughs, he even steals the finish, it was amazing! I am thinking why this movie works because although L&H is a selling point (and why I was hooked to see this one (them and Hal Roach), I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff), this holds keep them at a minimum and remain entirely on the ADULT fare (by 1930's standards, and not so far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to see, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ, and I loved him there, and I also sounded loud on his waitress in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in her 30s movie that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and music tracks have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality that blew me away from what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but be sure I really enjoyed this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it at TCM Europe and will register it to see again with my wife at TCM USA. Good stuff!
