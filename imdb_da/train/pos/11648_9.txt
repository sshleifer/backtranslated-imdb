There are people who claim that this is another "bad language" ultra violence Mexican movie. They are right, but more than that, this movie is a call to raise awareness of what we have become. The dreadful truth hurts or drills when you have already accepted the paradigm of living the Third World as the only possible goal. One of the most important things in "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to deep reflection on our present identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad and I understood how spoiled the Mexican community is when Tlahuac Incident came to light. I still can't understand the viewers who testify to a mass murder. I almost slipped when I saw some of the pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small village near Mexico City, when rampage was performed with the indulgence of the media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this movie deeply shocked me. The other stories were good at portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, fraud and violence, but I consider Tamales de Chivo the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams. They are meaningless in relation to people's actions. With a few exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human waste. Just as in real life, honesty becomes more exception than the rule in our country. Furthermore, honesty is only rewarded miraculously.
