The 60s are a fantastic movie (I saw it all for one night) about the hippy movement in the late 60s. Although the title would suggest otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60s are not particularly important in this movie. The main film in the film is Michael, a political activist who is heading in the United States against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah.Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He comes back from the war, and changes in a "Tom Cruise, born on July 4," look and look in a hippy. Her father is a pro-Vietnam type of guy (what a surprise !!). Michael's sister Kate gets pregnant from a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love. The end is very poor (Dad becomes a liberal and everyone is happy), but I let this slip away from my voice (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> Actors performances are pretty good, and the movie's soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the movie, like the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King as well as the great hippy protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Take a closer look at Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid worker at the Woodstock festival! In the end, the 60s are a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10.10
