I really liked this movie. I have read a few of the other comments, and although I am reverent of those who did not understand it, I agree with some of the critics. Which in a strange way makes me like this movie more and more. I accept that they have a beautiful cast to reintroduce an intelligent movie to the public, but it has so many levels and is still great to see. I also love the movies, like this one, that evokes so many debates, theories, possible conclusions and hidden subtitles. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, surely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. Saw this when it first came out while I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to come back to my hotel and I had a great paranoia trip! Where does the dream end and the real beginner?
