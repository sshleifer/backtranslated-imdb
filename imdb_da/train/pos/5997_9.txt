Let me start by saying that I have never gone through a movie on IMDb before; However, I am in the video biz myself. And come from that perception; I can say without a doubt that this movie is what a card should be. It has a very good story and another thing I love - (even better twist ends). Opening was very good, I loved the video chosen for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B&W, but the way this movie uses the effect it works on. And with every movie there is everything that matters. The flow of the movie works perfectly and editing was very well done. From a technical side of things (which is since I usually work) everything is also very well done. There is no major tech. things to point out. The only less I have is that the final credits are a small jump. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would have preferred to see more of the love scene, but I am a guy (so you can criticize it for a four-factor). So overall I rate it a 9/10. It's worth looking at if you're a fan of Indian and / or short movies. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
