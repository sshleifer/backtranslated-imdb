The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (the Bible believes). I do not go with the right-wing believers. I fell out of that atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In my attempt to take over our government, they do what Judas tried to do. I call it Judas Syndrome. Judas did not get it, even though Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed some of it. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a watch-over and over film. <br /> <br /> Very satisfactory.
