This is a movie that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews while in production and have been waiting for the release! Cheers to the director and all the actors. The support provided Eva Mendez with what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else says, the last part of the movie is nonsense. Katie Cassidy did a fantastic job with her character, as she had not done much work when this film was made. She has the right career in front of her. I was amazed at her performance. I have totally enjoyed the movie, questioning my values ​​in life and priorities and being a better person for it! A big message lies within the film. Drop it so everyone can enjoy it!
