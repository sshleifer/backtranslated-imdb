This 1991-NBC television movie was broadcast six months before John Goodman's large version of Babes Ruth's life came out. For my money there is no comparison between the two. The TV production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional story. I especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love relationship that Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood his starring brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruth's own character error would never let him become a leader or leader of players. The TV movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of controlling the Yankees because of his mistakes, while the terrible Goodman version tries to push the innocence that Ruth was denied, which should have been his to take. <br /> <br /> This movie makes a great companion to "Eight Men Out" since the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox Scandal, and when his home runs exploits literally rescued baseball from ruin . In fact, the continuity between the two films is accentuated by John Anderson, representing his "eight-man" role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
