Man with the gun is largely forgotten now, but caused a minor storm of media interest in 1955 when Robert Mitchum knocked down both Jett Rink in Giant (which was actually written to him and which was subsequently substantially reworked) and Charles Laughton's scheduled version of The Naked and the Dead to do it instead. Despite some obvious production problems and a little harsh lighting that occasionally makes both Mitch and Jan Sterling in incredible tones, it's a stunning dark western that more than compares to his former Blood on the Moon when his "town tamer" sets working on a city it has never had the chance to grow up before being driven by the local bathers before turning out to ?? possibly ?? Be almost as bad as the men he sends. Certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family ?? burn a salon to the ground and goading his manager to try to kill him ?? does not inspire much confidence in his stability. In addition to a good script and a surprisingly good support swing from the usually annoying, but here well Henry Hull threw, it also boasts a strikingly good early Alex North score, which even includes an early training for one of his troubled emotional characters. who later appear in Spartacus.
