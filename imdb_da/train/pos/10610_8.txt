A sweet-hearted young mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) arrives at an abandoned girl in the woods and falls in love with her. The city's elders generally support him in keeping the baby, even though a local temptation (Cara Seymour) seems a bit of the new family. A particular little girl on a long walk and a creepy travel dealer (David Strathairn at his shame) has parallel stories that converge in a fateful way. This is a charming piece of life in the Ozarks in the same vein as "Where the Lillies Bloom" & "The Dollmaker". All three were shot on the spot in the beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple living - but not simple-minded - American folk music. A minimum of strong language and short but pointed violence makes this fairly safe family view.
