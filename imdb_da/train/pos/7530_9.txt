This is a sequel to the batman the animated and it is just as good as it is for all the same reasons that it has lots of action in that story until it is good, the voice of actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as batman, Mark Hamil as Joker etc. The bad guys are really good, such as The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface etc. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman's new adventure because it's really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collector's edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********* out of ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** out of **** *
