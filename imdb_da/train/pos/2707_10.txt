Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is great as the central character and everyone manages to play it just enough to make the comedy natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good and the pieces are a joy to watch. I recommend watching this movie with a lot of friends, a few bottles of your brand of choice and preparing to be amazed and very entertained. <br /> <br /> This is so perfect from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From the outer space it is in the true "B" movie tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who participated in the movie. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find my self-figures on the scene, where Zane boasts a set of steps without any apparent reason in an almost ballet style. Everything a little sour, and the better for it.
