This was the first movie I ever saw Ashley Judd in and the first movie by Victor Nunez 'I ever say, and boy am I glad I did. The 'quiet tone, its' laid-back pace, its' realistic depiction of a young woman who has just begun in life, is its fine portrayal of the struggles she must undergo to make her mark in life, the decisions she makes based on real things, the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. It's so close to movie magic that I've ever seen outside of the "Star Wars" movies, and considering what those movies are like, it means that this movie deserves a high rating indeed. Ashley Judd's play, Mr. Nunez'writing and its' big, simple, worthy story make this a great future story and a wonderful movie.
