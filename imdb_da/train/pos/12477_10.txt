My family and I have seen this movie often over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and heartwarming. Showing us compassion between two families in two countries thousands of miles apart and in the most eerie cases, it is almost as if God's hand had to intervene. 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desi the heart hit little girl, does a great job of acting her part, and for me she was the Priam choice in the lead. All in all, a 10 out of 10. There are no downsides to this sweet human story. Children of all ages want to see this, and this will bring the family of friends together with smiles and good feelings.
