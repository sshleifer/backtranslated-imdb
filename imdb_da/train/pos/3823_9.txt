I saw this movie in the worst possible circumstance. I had already missed 15 minutes when I woke to it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I didn't know what I was watching, I thought it was a movie this week, but quickly got ripped off by the performance of the leading actress who played a young woman whose kid had been kidnapped. The premise began to twist and I did not look forward and at the final credit, I scrambled through the instructions during the flight to find out what I had just seen. Turns out I was recently discovered Do-Yeon Jeon, who had won the best actress in Cannes for the role. I don't know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I'm out on the DVD store to discover more.
