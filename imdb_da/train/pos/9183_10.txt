This amazing 1983 television production (not a movie written by others) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre", with Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the finest version that has been made for date, as it is Charlotte Bronte's most faithful novel in the concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; When the film producers begin to interfere with a classic's very lifeblood, the classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of THIS "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and faith towards the original, resulting in a spectacularly addictive composition worth seeing several times to enjoy its many layers of sweetness and joy and excitement. The performances are lovely, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful, and the right tone for the production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that this version, like any other version ever made by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but to stay with Rochester after finding out that he had a crazy wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just get a divorce," she would say to her husband, or she would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she couldn't settle this course in life and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the basis of the Christian faith she had been taught since childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution, but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred instead of not turning the other cheek. Someday I would like to see a version depicting these influences a little more completely in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the epitaph "Once again, Lord Jesus came!" should not have the basis for the belief that has been removed from it.
