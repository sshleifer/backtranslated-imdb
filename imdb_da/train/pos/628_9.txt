This movie is very fun. The actors really make the film go a long way though. Without renouncing the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the time test. You will see a completely different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All items are there from adventure to romance and well-placed comedy. People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents did it themselves!) Good special effects can be daunting for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism. <br /> <br /> Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
