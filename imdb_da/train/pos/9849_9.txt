When I saw trailers, I just had to watch the movie. And when I had, I had a feeling that felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, not confusing me, but I think the big parts already in trailers, if you catch my impetus. It went very fast and it rolled on so I was never bored and I enjoyed seeing it. The humor was amazing. My first contact with a sloth (.. or something similar).
