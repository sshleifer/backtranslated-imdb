I was just a little young for this, but I had to see it. There are some excellent music that many people have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance of "Angel", a now most ignored but even quite popular musical outfit. They carry their branded white outfits, they strike through "20th Century Foxes," and apparently everyone is trying to get into the camera's field of view. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the ties highlighted and has apparently never received much of a haircut ever! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaway singer) begins a short but remarkable acting career here, and is quite memorable with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her topless 3-D scenes in "Parasite" and her UFO observation in "Wavelength" kept us all watched her). <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece, but it retains part of its period, for everyone to stare at and wonder.
