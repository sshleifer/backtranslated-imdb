I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it. This movie had so many feelings and felt so real that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I see it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with busy Phillips character and how I would feel if the same had happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think every high school should show this movie, maybe it will prevent people from doing the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those who have been hit by any school day. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best movies all the time.
