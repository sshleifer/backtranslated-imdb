I've seen this movie many times, and I never get tired of it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterical fun and yet totally touching at the same time. For those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or foreign films in general, you open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so entertaining. Don't make me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (though it's just a big laugh at one of the protagonists called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't even think of this movie without smiling !! I love it ... and I think most people will too.
