I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years at T.V. or video. It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston movies. Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective. I flew in out of the state to watch six of the films over a two-day period. Soylent Green looked good on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From its opening montage to the home scene to the great end, the film was amazing. Charlton Heston as a policeman living in a dog eats the dog's world with few natural resources back and no understanding of how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past is both great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better in a large 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen and cinematorhy, write, use music, and everything about it. The film is also very powerful in its gloomy and very possible future vision. Just think about how the world's population grew, the rainforest that disappeared, the resources were used, the greenhouse effect worsened since 1973. I just wonder why this movie hasn't played in theaters all these years. Its reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Talking about reputation, people often speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced that he is one of our best actors. Of course, he made about a dozen other great movies and for those who worry about what they are. <br /> <br />
