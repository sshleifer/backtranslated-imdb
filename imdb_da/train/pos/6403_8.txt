Men of HONOR have Cuba Gooding Jr. in what is probably his best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a heavy-duty man and hero. He is a poor farmer from the south who wants to become a fleetdiver - but has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck, however, growing to respect Brashear. The film is about how Brashear should adhere to the almost insurmountable odds, not once but twice. The performance is what makes this movie special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, gives a tough performance - his best dramatic work this year. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film is on the patriotism a little too strong (but not how close to the level it was in the PATRIOT), and a couple of the characters are just a dimensioning bad (Hal Holbrooks Mr. Pappy is just so vicious), but the film is a rarity among movies today . It is uplifting and invisible. A wonderful movie.
