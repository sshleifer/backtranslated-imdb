I like the original and this movie has its up and down. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original voice threw back. <br /> <br /> Downs: I didn't like Timon's Ma's voice. I know she made a voice in The Simpsons, but that show is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We'll see Simba as a "teenager". Downs: They wasted it with a gurgling competition between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." Downs: How did Pumbaa find out? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (eg Timon's solo.) <br /> All in all, it's a really good movie. I would recommend it to fans of the original. But if you don't like the original, chances are that you don't like this. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
