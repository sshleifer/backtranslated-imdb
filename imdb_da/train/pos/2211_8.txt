I don't see a lot of tv, except Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! S Soup. I think I'm holding this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives. Soup also helps me keep myself beyond what people in the office refer to when talking about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp.). The best part is that Soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (let's see most people being hooked on watching American idol because of the freak show that is auditioning) which is why most people claim to see. And that means I don't have to suffer through the 98% of these crazy talk shows or "reality" shows, for a nugget "fun" or "shock". The only reason why soup does not get a 10 in my opinion is once the sketches are not so funny, and in an even rarer occasion, the comment is not always quite up to each other. But they can't all be home-run, if so, Soup wouldn't be on E !. Joel's quick wit and Soup's writing team (which includes McHale) do a good show. I happen to enjoy the laughter and comments of the crew who are out of the camera. Even when they become blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs, it's fun because it's forced. They are, of course, ironic. And that's part of what makes this show fun.
