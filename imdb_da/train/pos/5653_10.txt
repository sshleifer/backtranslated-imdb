This was an absolute spellbinding series and was sorry that I could only catch a few shows far back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind, and it all had an unpleasant air of stylish fear of it. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative I can see) to realize what a truly innovative series was and how it was captured on the imagination. I now understand reading the comments it got CANCELED that is just so incredible. What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' may have been (or maybe still) running around to do it.
