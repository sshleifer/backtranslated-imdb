Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on her way to puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers), whom she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really scary moments. Although this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating, it is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasies, stay far away. But if you are a game for something else, this fits the bill. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with an equally beautiful music score and a couple of good, scary jolts. The only thing that prevents this from being a really good movie is Burke - she's not a very good actress (it's not surprising that this has been her only movie) and it hurts the movie. But everyone else is just good. Spiers are very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (faking a British accent very well) is also very good when Anna's mother and Ben Cross are both scary and sympathetic as Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A sleeping bum as it was released in 1988, has since faded away. It's too bad - it's really very good.
