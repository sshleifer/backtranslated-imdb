This is not among Jimmy Stewart's best movies - I can quickly admit it. But while some see their movie as pure propaganda, I wonder what is so wrong with it? Yes, certainly, like the TV show FBI, this is an obvious case that the Bureau does some PR work to try to drum up support. But as entertainment goes, it does a good job. Plus, surprisingly at the time it was made, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and "Commies". Instead, it is a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose. Now considering the agent being played by Jimmy Stewart, then it is quite certain that acting and writing were good - as it was a real budget movie and a study that was not wasting the star in a triple flick. So overall, it's worth seeing, but not very big.
