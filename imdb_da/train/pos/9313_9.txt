I liked this show a lot - we got the first and only, it seems to be series in the UK on channel 4. The characterization was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons, as all the different facets of the small town population were represented. <br /> <br /> There was no slamming track - I hadn't seen this on an American television comedy at that time except on Larry Sanders, and it worked really well here and raised the suggestion that these crazy poles were really that way And not just hamming it up to the cameras. All in all, a quirky little number that tickled me right: I can't help but believe that it might have missed it, marked by certain audiences. I think it would have been a cult strike in the UK if it had been shown at an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I will round this off with my standard comment: Where in hell can I get this to see it again? Some ideas?
