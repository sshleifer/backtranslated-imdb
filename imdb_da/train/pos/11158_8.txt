Shocking, well-made chiller is an underestimated tale of terrible murder and evil forces. <br /> <br /> Small doctor attempts to discover who or what commits a number of violent sexual murders. <br /> Incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrific kill sequences based on an off-beat and creepy climate shift. The murder scenes are intense and gory so this is not a movie for the squeamish! John Hough's direction along with a bizarre music score combines to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the movie. It also carries a kind of Gothic feel. Smart movie sites and some stylish cameras also highlight. <br /> <br /> Cast is also not bad. The great John Cassavetes makes a solid performance as the new doctor in town. Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as the local reporter, Helen Hughes as the city's historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a troubled psychic teen. <br /> <br /> Around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that has to be re-uncovered and reviewed. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
