"The big farewell" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as a private researcher Dixon Hill. These episodes create a kind of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to handle the program in different circumstances without playing a game (represented by the error in the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand Star Trek's ability and enable a kind of genre mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of the 1940s crime film, and their on-screen representation is referred to as Film Noir, which often has stereotypical anti-heroism (see for example Chandler's Marlowe stories or Polanski's all-time classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple "how-do-we-get-out-of-here" scenario), but allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These Holodeck "games" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the crew members' private interests. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from that point of view, the stories are never sound (but has Star Trek ever had a technical, scientific point on it, I mean besides some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "The big goodbye" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who almost never looked better in a Star Trek episode (at least the early ones) and Data also has some amazing scenes (even If I find it hard to believe pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would really have surprised him for the fact that he had done research during that period and its customs. Wesley continues to turn peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let gangsters finish him?) But all in all, it's fun ...
