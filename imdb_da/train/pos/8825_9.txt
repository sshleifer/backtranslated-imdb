This Oscar nominator from 2004 is a very short b / w film in Spanish. A young woman walks into a cafe, gets a coffee and notices a few musicians standing still with their instruments. All patrons are motionless, like mannequins. However, a guy is pretty jolly and breaks into a song about what is going on at. 7:35 in the morning. There is a surprising moment after the second to the end, which is right, yes, surprising. People, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. And as the musical piece "Bolero", the thing continues to build until climax. With its structure, theme, movement and humor, it is an 8 minute masterpiece.
