I accidentally tuned this to the independent movie channel and was riveted. I am a professional actor and I was flabbergastet of the performances. They felt completely improvising, absolutely without influence. I couldn't tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited eventually to see credits and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the author director also made a very nice movie called Everyday People, which I enjoyed very much. The shame in the film industry is that projects that are excellent do not get the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves to be flown high and proud. I encourage people to look it up and see it.
