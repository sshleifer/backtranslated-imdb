One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The molding is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City, where the two leads are superstars in the production. Fun, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing experience on urban youth that often puts Larry Clarks in the shooter where it belongs ... although I have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare. Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you want to kick yourself to miss ... so don't miss it!
