The true story of a lot of junkies robs a not so honest businessman of fabrics, jewelry, weapons and money. Some would say that this is the tragic tale of America in the exaggerated 80s, where the supremacy of peace and free love was plunged into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, these are just ordinary people with nothing in life sitting around getting tall and deciding to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? When they have their stuff ... they will sit and be tall again. Big plan. Although you do not know the story, there is no excitement in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox is trying to make a kind of folk hero out of these characters, with party scenes and a fitting of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more straight forward approach. As it is, it's just a sad story of retailers being killed by big-time dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is in the middle of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in the wonderland, with the wonders of fading away. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holme's life. It's not quite the facts, but it's far more comfortable.
