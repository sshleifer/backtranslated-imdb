I didn't feel this movie was as smart as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it anyway. <br /> <br /> It's original, but reminded me of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the coloring, but also for the edgy quality of the characters' close-ups. /> Put in a prison cell, but don't let it get you started. Apparently, this movie seems longer than many a multi-localized blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' well in the foreground and very good characterization makes some just too credible! <br /> <br /> Scary with some gore it is well worth looking at.
