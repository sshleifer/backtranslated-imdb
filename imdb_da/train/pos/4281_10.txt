One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I don't know if anyone in our country has not seen this movie! It's funny and sad for a few moments ... I don't know how have people all over the world (who had the opportunity to see it) accept this movie because you need to know some moments in our Serbian history and the nature of Serbs in it first half of the 20th century to understand it! But as I see here, someone from Canada who looked at it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this page, but first to find out how to do it ... Cheers.
