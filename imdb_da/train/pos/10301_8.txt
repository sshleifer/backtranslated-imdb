Bruce Almighty, one of Carry's best pictures since ... Well ... a long time. It features one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time too ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly fun. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but over all a great movie with some fun scenes. The best scene in this is where Jim breaks the anchor's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
