Ask yourself where she got the gun? Remember what she was taught about the field's thinking when the wife is over? The gun had items and it was delivered to her from the beginning. <br /> <br /> When the patient returns at the end, she was SUPPOSED to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gangster's 80,000. <br /> <br /> The patient was in his wife from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mantegna does not eventually die - the gun had items. <br /> <br /> There - enough spoilers for you there? That's why people give it so high ratings. It is extremely original because of the hidden end and how it breaks most of the audience.
