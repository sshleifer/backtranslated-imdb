Hidden Frontier is known to be the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series. Although the production quality is not on a par with fan productions such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier concentrates heavily on history, and it does very well. Hidden Frontier has no physical set; Instead, actors appear against a greenscreen, and the background is digitally inserted. One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the large amount of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of the film, rather than in the post-production. Although it saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting recording is not as high as it had been produced in the post-production, even though it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> Though it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is a great shot, although you may be best to start seeing the third season, as this is where the producers really start to beat their stride.
