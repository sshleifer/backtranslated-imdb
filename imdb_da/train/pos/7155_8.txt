More than just a "children's movie", "Holes" looks at how past events still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When the teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he has to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection to it. Through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you understand better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a good job, like the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
