Tigerland is one of the finest movies I've seen, and in my opinion, it's even full metal jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell, and is a character that keeps you in mind long after the film's end. The end is cut brilliantly by schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. What a movie.
