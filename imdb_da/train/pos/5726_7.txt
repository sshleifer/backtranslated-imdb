"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror movies. Shimizu knows he's not dealing with anything new so he does what an intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates on giving viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. The non-linear narrative is not just a gimmick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (just like a comedy is to make people laugh), this film of flying colors succeeded. I saw it in a theater with an audience, and it was fun to watch the viewers go wild over this one. It probably doesn't play well in your living room.
