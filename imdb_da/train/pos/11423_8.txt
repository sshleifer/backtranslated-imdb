This film shows life in northern Cameroon from a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government, and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives a sense of how life was as to both the colonists and the natives they were associated with. It's a feeling consistent with another movie I've seen about Africa in a similar period (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is discreet. The viewer is allowed to draw his own conclusions instead of having the filmmakers forced on him, although the framing of the story as a feedback from the woman's visit to the southwestern cameroon as an adult gives some perspective.
