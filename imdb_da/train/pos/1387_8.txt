A little slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The film's magic lies in its ability to bring many memories back to how it felt to be their age. The confusion and uncertainty are depicted in a very simple way, but so true to life. The music is perfect and the play is amazing. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back on this particular period when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a great movie for young people during this period. So many films have been made about adolescence, but it is really the right fact to discover the adult world of romance and its complexities.
