I admit I have weakness for alternative stories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY at 12:01. Among these greats is this little gem. It's pretty hard to get through MR. DESTINY without expressing gratitude to each cast member, from good-hearted James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This movie lacks gravitas and the scale to make it a good movie, but it is a nice encouragement on a rainy afternoon. It is also a good rental for a cheap date.
