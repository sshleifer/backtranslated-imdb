I watched this movie before I came to the British Army. I went through my basic training, first and foremost difficult and then when I went much easier. My time was spent at the height of the problems of the NI and the Cold War. There were times when I asked myself what I was getting into, not too long, as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The voice over used to show what the soldiers think is the place, though I would have added breathing and pulse as this seems to pound in your eardrums in given situations. Some years later I was in Canada for a family together. One of mine who lives in the United States and is a speaker at Columbus Uni Ohio, had made a document about the British Army's influence in the NI. She spent some time out there and researched. Although an ex pat, she was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and condemned me to be a British soldier. My only answer was to watch the movie 'A Long Day Die'. This is the closest thing a citizen will realize why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
