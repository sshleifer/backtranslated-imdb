I just finished listening to the director's comment on this movie, and I think the one great thing I got from what I agree with is that this movie, like Mann's Insider, is completely subjective. It's from Howard's POV. So any review or attempt to consider a set of comments about what Ebert did is really about Nolte's character indeed. If you feel like he did the movie "doesn't work" then you say I think Howard doesn't work. And to be honest, you're right. Howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis. <br /> <br /> But hi, it's human nature. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
