Another in them does not make them the category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in the closet still qualifies as well clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their height as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being extremely well-deserved. They counteract the somewhat bland driver. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's a little hard for me to accept Rock Hudson, who plays such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but it's more of a personal bias than anything else. But it doesn't detract from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is a lot, and this movie is extremely visible. If you are in the night and this movie comes on, I would say see it. Well, it's worth it.
