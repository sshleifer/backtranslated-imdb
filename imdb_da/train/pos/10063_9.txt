The film is comfortable and the environment is very realistic. I liked that boldly redressed the perceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays in the 1930s mainland Chinese landscape as well as several basic human issues - I felt I could get a real sense of time, recreated even in amazing shots of traditional Chinese theater and in purist depictions of street dwellings. It seemed worth experiencing. The interwoven role that Buddhism plays is probably the most true form - both in its meniscus and in its philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective one I have seen in Chinese film. Casting is fantastic. Pictures are memorable. Action is solid enough. Thematic puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle for its expression.
