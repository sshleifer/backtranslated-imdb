Watched this movie for the first time while drinking a motel in Canada. As you jump through channels, you came across the Easy Lube section. My friend continued to turn around, but I told him to go back. Something about the name light lube just doesn't sound right. Looking the rest of the movie it was pretty marvelous fun. Check out a few names from the credits and come home to look it up. It turned out to be Chevy Chase's first movie. I didn't remember him in it. Didn't remember much about it so I rented it and gave it another veiw. It's pretty funny and pretty graphic. It's like the Kentucky Fried Movie except not so much fun. Love the fingers, light lubricant and I'm f ** kin 'presidential parts. Dealer shit is also pretty cool. I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
