I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it's not new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here groups it with other war movies, this movie has been categorized in lack! It's not a war movie more than "A wing over the cuckoo's nest" is an asylum movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about individuality, disagreement, self-confidence and the cost of this personality type. The plot is the same as "A wing over the cuckoos nest" and "Cool Hand weed", its in good company and it has its own. Its these films must be kept up against and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
