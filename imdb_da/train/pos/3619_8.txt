Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams. I was surprised it didn't hit me as over-sentimental; this movie played fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role, which says something to a sports film. I can't remember how many sports movies have had a little caress that disturbs me; here all the parts look. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict it will do surprising business as it is a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this movie is a success.
