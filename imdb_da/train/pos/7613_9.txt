/ The first episode I saw of Lost, made me think, I thought, what are these some people who crashed and were chased by a giant monster. But that's not the way it is much more than that, because they are not at all a monster and any episode that you see of Lost, and it gets better every time. a desert island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed. It's the right secret. <br /> <br /> This series of rules and I can't wait to know what's really going on there, I hope they don't fly the last 2 episodes in the theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
