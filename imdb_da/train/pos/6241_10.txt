In the beginning, I had reaction many people back with after seeing this: that shot of obese people sunbathing, etc. were cheap shots in a way. OK so he makes diane arbus meetings. . . no matter what. . . but it was not long before I realized that this was not done in a dehumanizing way when the images unfold I felt that the problem was quite the audience: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from almost everywhere, actually feeling watching people over A certain age behaves in a sexual way is something indecent something that should not appear. If this were all the films offered it would be a great deal. But the story of the woman with the violent girlfriend and his drunk friend hits really like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and thinking the scene was improvised. The blonde guy is a genius actress. Finally, I would contradict those who say that this movie is about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is wearing clothes with the woman who is finally dancing for him is quite an OK sign that breaks the mold, so do not understand the movie by looking at him. yes his dog is killed. This is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. . . totally hopeless. nevertheless, I felt really grateful for the film maker to make such a beautiful movie all in all. I wouldn't say that each of the threads was as strong as the strongest, but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . .
