An excellent series, masterfully acted and directed, but extraneous (I am told) by Mr Deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation. It is now only visible in private collections, and via the British Film Institute on special request. Very unfortunate when Ian Holm's nuanced portrayal of the tired but certainly Bernard Samson is amazing; one of his very best performances. The support molding, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, is excellent. With Mel Martin playing the conflicting and treacherous wife and Michael Degen as Mercurial Werner, the story tells positively with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game.
