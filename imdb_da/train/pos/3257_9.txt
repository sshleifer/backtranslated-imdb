I just watched this movie for the second time on TV. It is lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I have rarely seen actors better able to reveal love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. by their movements and movements. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply surpass herself. Masterson probably has the toughest role and is just cute. <br /> <br /> The movie is in the way of both romantic films, such as While You Were Sleeping, when Harry met Sally, sleepless in Seattle and "high gimmick" kind of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue married. . I hate to say this because this cast was great, and I would never change any of them - but I think it didn't work as well as the movies mentioned above, because the box appeal from the appeal was just not as big as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's not amazingly written - for example, the characters' lines are not very memorable. But it is done to perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic longings are truly tangible, the "feelings" of people who fall in love, are beautifully broadcast, the timelessness of love and the all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and the desire to resume the connection are so touchingly delivered. Again and again you will find yourself moved. In fact, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven â€” the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it here - it's great.
