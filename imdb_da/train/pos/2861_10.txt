I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love to see it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also great fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and paste your own dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I have my DVR set to record all the episodes and I happened to catch the tail end of an episode (just before the next start ... so I don't know which episode it was), but there was a horrible sequencing error! Adam had handed Sheriff Coffee a small color "leather" which was torn from some outlaw's coat when he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy came with the jacket so he put it out on his desk and put the swatch right where it was torn off. The mushroom was even rectangular ... which I suppose would be almost impossible to tear from a piece of leather (after the 1950s Naugahyde? Yes. Leather? I don't think so). Now the swatch was perfect and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not ten seconds later in the scene, we see coat again, which is still on Roy's desk. But this time the color swatch is more like the shape of North Carolina, and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was smack-dab in the middle of the swatch) is now gone .. Like the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh when we played the short scene again and again and again! It's the leader of youtube, I'm telling you! <br /> <br /> We never love the show though, and the sequencing errors make it a lot of fun!
