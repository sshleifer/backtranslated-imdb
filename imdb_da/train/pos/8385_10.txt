This movie seems to get bad criticism for some reason. Probably just by the mass. In any case, this is actually a very interesting movie. The film is an under-budget sci-fi movie that actually works because of an interesting story and well-executed scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If there are any Sci-Fi fans reading this, I really recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The setting includes nations that are at war with GIGANTIC machines that entire countries invest all their money in! The world has been divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather a "robot duel". The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, as now all have them on these respiratory masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well-written and good effects for the smart budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have small budgets and actually work.
