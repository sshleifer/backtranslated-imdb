Although I love this movie, I can hardly see it, it's so real. So I put it on tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered it alive, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before ........ I didn't: it's because it's so right for me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote that commentators' ages should appear with their summary. I'm all for it! It is quite clear that most of these people who have commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They mention other films, Jon Voight, and Dustin Hoffman has appeared at a later date. I'm just as ruinously honest: I'm 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, please be aware that I was a professional female emulator for 60 years and you have also appeared in movies - you would never recognize me even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? YOU REQUIRE I DO !! .... <br /> <br /> .... and are not least ashamed. If you haven't driven into any of them, it's your loss - but there's a big chance you have but just didn't know it. So many mothers, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret Many actors / actresses have emerged from the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who should judge? I can mention several current BIG-TIME stars that were traveled in the many places in the many cities and they were not least damaged by their time there. I do not make a judgment, because they are people, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility. You name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like. <br /> <br /> The "trivia" of Hoffman actually begging on the street to prove he could do the role "Ratzo" is a gem - he can be seen driving his car around Los Angeles - how do you think you get his input? I can also mention many male stars who have been on the streets and crossed the pillars for money. Although the nightclub, which I last lasted for 26 years, was world famous and legitimate, I can also mention some GREAT stars that were constantly hunted out of our backyard and I would like to download. <br /> <br /> This should not be a surprise today, even though it is definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, big and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they have a different shade. <br /> <br /> Some of the "user's" thoughts "Joe Buck" had been infected by his grandmother. Although I saw him in bed with a girlfriend, I didn't find any of them. Believe it or not, children have not always had their own rooms - because it is a must today, tell you something that can be kinky in the bedroom. If the company Hoffman may have asked for a change in the street, but some of the "users" pointed out that Jon Voight was not a big star for the recording of "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual pay would surprise you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the clarity he put in his role, nor that it made him a star for such great work as "Salvation." He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was better for it: few people commented that he had been sodomized in this movie. The late 60s may have been one of the first films that are so open, but society has always been hip. <br /> <br /> I also found no homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposites, unpleasant to each other. They found a very purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand it at the end of the movie, then you wasted your time. "Joe's" confusion, but unashamed devotion was evident. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull off and he was so beautiful in his youth. Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them excellent. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this movie was beautifully defined - if you don't think they're still around, you're wrong. "The party" ? - participate in some of the "raves" younger people participating in ..... if you can enter. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see any outrageous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's slim women, who sometimes have to come down to the nitty-gritty. If you were shocked at her brilliant plays, thinking "this is not true", look at today's "ladies" who live on the brink of disrepute .... and admired for it. <br /> <br /> The brutality "Joe" appears in robbing the old guy, unfortunately is also part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. "Joe" pointed out his purpose - in that situation I would have transferred the money faster than he asked for it. It's one of the scenes that make this movie a breakthrough, which I don't see. I am combed for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger must surely have been familiar with this sordidness to lead this chillingly beautiful eye-opener - Waldo Salt did not write from clairvoyance. Anyone who had part of getting it to the screen must have realized that they were making history and should be proud of the honesty of it. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do nothing to present it to the public. Not appearance doesn't mean it's not there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! for all......
