I watched this movie after watching it on Broadway. I love Broadway musical and I love the movie. I saw the movie as if it wasn't related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they become movies, so I developed a philosophy really early. Suppose that the film should be based on the book (or musical in this case), but that the story may be the same, it will not be the same, it will be different, so look for what it is. <Br /> <br /> I danced for 12 years before I had to choose. I was a good dancer (pick up choirs work in local productions as a child etc), but I wasn't super talented. However, I was super talented as a show rider. I was told by my dance instructor and trainer (who I spent several months a year on his farm outside the state) that I had to choose when I was 14. I had to move from dancing two hours four and five days per week and runs 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicates to one or the other. So I love to dance dearly and I love this movie and a lot of other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotions and human interaction. It's about the power of expectation and heartache when you work really hard to get something you want and you just don't get it. I love the movie. I love Broadway musical.
