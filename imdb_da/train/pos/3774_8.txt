In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's great adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened from the future as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to the ground to kill human Bill and Ted to change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excels in delivering great humor to the audience in this entertaining sequel. Bogus Journey lacks the sharpness first, but still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading couple, not to mention a hilarious notion of William Sadler, bringing a humorous side to the depth, the ugly reaper. Look for the game's sequences, the best moment in the whole movie, but one of many good techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> While still full of humor, this movie has a more dramatic movie against it, with stakes becoming more serious and situations more risky. <br /> <br /> This gives the movie's big dimension and another lovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven are highly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again tasty with the use of the amazing time-traveling machine, but again a bit confusing at points of use of timing, and objects and situations are placed before it happens in the present, as evidenced by the last few scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy when I appreciated the jokes and the story more, and though the jokes and plot are not as powerful as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough to feel good motives, jokes and a fairly stable plot to make it a good family movie.
