I will be quick to address the film's questions here: It was a very engaging story of the devastating qualities of all-consuming passions; a young Italian woman who cannot feel emotionally in connection with her imprisoned political radical fianc√© (due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover whom she explicitly mentions sexually relative to. The anxiety, rage, tenderness and passion that revolves around the atmosphere of history is similar to the unpleasant quiet that seems to break out the two leaders. It gives the film a disturbing mood that permeates all the political strife otherwise lost on the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 80s). I found the movie compelling ... what ruined it is a free oral sex scene that the actor performs on the male management ... it's not simulated and leaves little to the imagination. There are other scenes of sex in the movie that I feel were needed because they outline the insanity and loneliness that the characters live in. But the oral sex scene I think, focuses on the actual story. It was smooth sailing until that time, and when the infamous sex scene occurs (causing much hoopla back in its day), it's like hitting a roadblock. It is devastating and unnecessary, and I am in the camp who believes that the film would not have been damaged if the scene had been removed from it. And it is unfortunate that this particular scene can prevent people from seeing this exciting movie that I think is worth watching because there is so much going on beneath the surface, emotions and further disturbances stored in the subtitle. <br /> <br /> All in all: Wonderful movie hampered by a very rude sex scene.
