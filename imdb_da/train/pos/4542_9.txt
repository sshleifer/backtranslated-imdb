Centered in downtown and the outskirts of Detroit, this comedy seemed to be a great new comedy duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man who happens to be a police officer from Japan on the trail of an industrial secret thief who has stolen a "proto type" turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow thieves after becoming ordered by its commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast-paced' but down to business-player type Detroit policeman. When crossing paths, however, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meets the all-out old school Detroit Police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and turn over at the beginning, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two-layer powerhouse that solves the case, cold. After fighting a city chief of police for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, the two go from abusing each other to being friends and working well together. Slightly worse for wear and need for a longer holiday on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis direction makes this an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
