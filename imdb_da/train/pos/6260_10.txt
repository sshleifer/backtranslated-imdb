It was fun provocative! I am an Iranian and lived in the 21st century. I didn't know that such great tribes lived under such conditions at the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see it today or even in 1925 on one side of the world, a lady or baby could get everything earned for him or her clean and on demand, but here 80 years ago people were waiting for them life to go to a place with more grass. It is very interesting that these Persians bear these difficulties to find grass for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on the way. I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as Bakhtiari people.
