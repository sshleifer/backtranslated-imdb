I really liked this movie. I've seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it over his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story is lost in Gene Kelly movies for the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth the rent.
