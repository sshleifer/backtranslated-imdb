Back in 74, Eric Monte made the classic T.V-show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love to see Reruns at T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos mostly felt jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity, winning millions of fans time to sit and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ hadn't been there to save it with its always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have been longer than in the 1980s when I just grew up.
