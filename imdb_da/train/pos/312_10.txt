Based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave who becomes queen by catching the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond town of Tijuco, Brazil, the diamond budget - designated by the King of Portugal - is the ultimate authority. After growing up in the relative security of the house, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a headquarters in the city, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond buddy for the king and intends to use them to escape. The king's army is going to collect the diamonds the next day, and when the loot comes missing, the diamond champion is led in chains, his family disposed of and thrown onto the street with only the clothes on his back. Martin, the diamond buddy's son, swears revenge. However, Xica and the other slaves are sold at auction, and Xica ends up in the Sergeant Major's home, an old man who bought her exclusively to drag her desire. To the city of Tijuco comes the new diamond bidder, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately hit by Xica's beauty, he manipulates Sergeant Major to sell her to him. And thus, a love story filled with danger, intrigue and passion begins between a deliberate nobleman and a beautiful slave girl who rises to a day becoming queen. The series is full of rich details about the era's beliefs, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to catch your attention for every minute. At times fun with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of excitement and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
