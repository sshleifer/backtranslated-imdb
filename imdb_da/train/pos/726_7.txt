Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal - the evil Ms Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She strikes her head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves Ramones. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) may not seem to connect with any girl - not realizing that cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was put into general release and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight movie it was a big hit and was played all the time throughout the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of them when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughing scary at every joke and generally just having fun. <br /> <br /> Now, as an adult, I can't imagine why I loved it so much. The scripture is young and full of groans, which I could not believe I heard. Characters change randomly and the movie jumps everywhere. What saves this is some really fun lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who really enjoy themselves). Also, everyone is full of energy and plays their roles way over the top (as they should). As for Ramones ... I was never a fan. I do as the title bar, but the rest of the songs have never caught me. If you are a Ramones fan, you can give this a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) that probably finds it stupid but fun. I especially think they will like the end when high school is blown up! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s, you like it here. Otherwise, stay away. I give it a 7.
