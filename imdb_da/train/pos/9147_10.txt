As a great princess's fan in the last three to four years, I really can't believe I've just come around to see "Purple Rain". The all-new 2-year anniversary Special Edition made me buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I wasn't prepared for how electric it really is. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are nothing short of astonishing - he really has the movements in this. I am very familiar (from repetitive listening) with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all the songs, but to see them in the context of the movie you completely change your perception of melodies and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN themselves. There is something indescribably hypnotic about the scenes where Prince and Revolution perform. The final songs BABY I'M A STAR, and I want to die to show you how much energy and pure talent Prince was in the mid 20's (he's crowded!) It blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson seem lifeless even in his highest year. Prince shows you how to win the dream girl - drive her to a lake, let her jump in and drive away - fun stuff in thought. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious, but this adds to the overall charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious) and when his group The Time performer BIRD gets you to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton lit up on stage Minneapolis funk style - I love their dance in this bit and how Benton gives Morris a mirrored mid-performance. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it again, I really can't! Extras are amazing - especially when a young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills Cop admits he is a "Prince groupie".
