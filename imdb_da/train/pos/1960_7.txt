This brings about approx. a year after the events in the "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a football player while driving in a car of 110 miles / hour (don't ask), she goes out of the way and ends up in the Thames. She survives - he doesn't. Police are hiring psychiatrists Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she is mentally competent to try. Of course, she begins to play with her mind instead and lots of murders and sex follows. <br /> <br /> This film was judged before it opened. It took forever to get a cast and instructor, scripting issues were constant, and the cast was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). Still, it's not that bad. It's very much the first thing - there's a lush music score, beautiful places, lots of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an R), a nicely past due plot and good acting - but there is no influence. It feels like a retread of the first. People are killed here with a choker string (I think) ... like people were killed by an ice pick in the first. In a sweet moment, Stone picks up an ice pick and looks at the longing. She also plays mind games with a man and can get him involved in murder. The similarities are too clear. This is also very R-rated - there are plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks good) and some bloody murders. The plot is good across the board. Stone is just amazing here; Morrissey looks miserable, but is OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - this is not bad at all, but feels like a remake of the first. I still recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone didn't feel good, and they thought it was stupid to make a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was made.
