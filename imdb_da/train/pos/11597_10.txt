I read so many comments that I also shared about remembering this movie and wanted to see it so much again, but I didn't know the name of the movie. Fortunately, because of making a search and finding the title of this site, I read the comments here and realized that it was the movie I remembered. So I searched and found the movie and was so excited to see the movie once more 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and I would therefore like to thank you all. I would like to share how I could find this movie for all of you who also searched for a copy. It was on the VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney's "Call it Courage", which featured 2 movies, the other being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." It touched me as much as it did 40 years ago, and now I own my own copy of it. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and I've seen several copies of it there. Enjoy it, I know I did! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about a boy's love and the eagle he took care of. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy set the eagle free because he could not allow it to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe of punishment after releasing the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. The proximity that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert was so moving, and the film was truly remarkable. What a wonderful era was this? I have never seen anything coming close to this movie!
