I love this movie. It is crooked, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a crazy head, and certainly not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you don't find the movie entertaining then I think it's just not to your liking, so it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (one only got me the second time). There are others, but my taste is destined for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just do not tend to like that kind of thing. I make no excuses to have an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. The scenes and characters of this movie are well put together, the verbal humor is fun, the situations are exciting, the play is very good (as you would expect from the cast), although the acting requirements of the play of the script are not very high . The overall package makes fun, fun, serious yet violent entertainment.
