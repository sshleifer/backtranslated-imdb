This is not a love song. My one order summary of this movie would be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> It will probably not appeal to the mass profile to look public? It's a <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to join. You can observe, think and ask questions. <br/> <br /> Comparisons can be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall movie recording. <Br / <br /> <br /> However, this movie is unique to both. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic effects (solarization, freezing frame, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have been seen before, but they are most effectively used in this <br /> <br /> movie to support the natural excitement of history. <br /> <br /> It's all about raw, threatening and completely credible. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the movie is about friendship; The title really does <br /> <br /> play away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of the <br /> <br /> we've experienced or really wanted. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
