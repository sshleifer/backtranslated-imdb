This film is as much about Japanese culture as it does the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is wrinkled over those over 7 (especially in the public) and hence everything that bends instead of hugging even when you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and it too public! Never the less Ballroom dancing is (on the whole) immensely popular. People who perform ballroom dancing in Japan are seen a bit like nudists in the west ... many more would like to do, but are hampered by culture. A lovely family movie that any amateur dancer would enjoy alone with the dance sequences. I understand that it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I think Japanese is like the rest of us - they like to be hugged too.
