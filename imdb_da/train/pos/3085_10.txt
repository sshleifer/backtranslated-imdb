I saw the un-aired episodes online and I was so sad that the show will not be back. It had the best throw of mature, talented actors and a fantastic chemistry. It looked like all the actors are personal friends in real life. Towards the end, the show became engaging, sexy and highly visible. Of course, some of the lines of history are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all sympathetic and you are rooted in them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great kudos for all those cast. Note for ABC-execs: Nielsen ratings reports do not show you real results. Show the audience will mostly register it. I have been very disappointed with major networks to flood us with reality TV or teenage oriented shows. Why should we receive a mature, well-thought-out, well-traded material that we need to switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new stream medium will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
