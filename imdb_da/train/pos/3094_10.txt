This is the best and most original show this year. The more I see it more, I fall in love with it. Cast is excellent, writing is amazing. I personally like any character. But there is a favorite character for everyone, as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I think ABC has made a disservice to the authors, actors and to the potential audience of this show, canceling so quickly and not advertising it enough or giving it a real chance to get one afterwards. There are so few shows I see anymore, as most TVs are terrible. This show, in my opinion, was right up there with my favorites Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser showing so much extra time, and the winning shows with great potential are always dumped right away. I'm so sick of reality shows, I'm not looking at any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors, this show had so much promise. The latest episode was the best yet, as everyone is starting to really get into their parts and make the show right. Please see this show on ABC's video and let ABC know you want this show back.
