The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of America's goodness and beauty. At one level a slow walk through the heart, it's cozy residents and amber grains, on another level of getting old and remembering what's important (and actively forgetting what's not). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable movie that will be careful with me for a while.
