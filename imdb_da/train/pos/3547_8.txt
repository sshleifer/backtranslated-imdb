Entertaining musical, where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to come up with a floating crap game, so he entices Sky Masterson to try to save savage maids played by Jean Simmons to join Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would be in the missionary again in the amazing "Elmer Gantry." There she was sister Sharon and here she is sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is the devil Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged in Vivian Blaine for 14 years, and she detests his gaming habits. <br /> <br /> At a real pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who actually made his own song here! <Br /> <br /> The movie is stored by superlative choreography. The dancing and singing routines are amazing. They are especially realized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). All in all, it is a very nice production.
