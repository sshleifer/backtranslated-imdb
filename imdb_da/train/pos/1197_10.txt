I just watched this movie by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late 70's movie. And is actually better, more reserved and correct than, says Blue Soldier. The environmental, anthropological undertones are far ahead of their time. The discrete film is amazing and terribly realistic. Much more than dancing with wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of buffalo "killing fields" in the late 1800s. Probably because in the film they were real killing fields. The film was shot under legal forested buffalo culls so the animals you see are really shot, the bones are real. In summary, a very underestimated Western masterpiece, excellently acted, directed and shot.
