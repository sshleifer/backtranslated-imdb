Normally, musicians in the 1940s were of a formula - and if you were studying movies, you know what I'm talking about - a certain ongoing length, very "flashy" performances that were big on the surface but never came into the real personalities of figures etc. This one is different - and light years better and worth nominating for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although not had a chance to beat the final winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably the best form of career - yes, I know about American in Paris and Singing in the Rain. This one is different. He really comes into his character of a "sea wave" that thinks (at first) "picking up a girl while on vacation" is no more than a lark. And if you were to make a "story" to get her - then it is - until. Kind of like the musician when he gets "his foot caught in the door". The final hilarity of the movie stems mainly from his and his new friend (Sinatra) attempt to make the "story" good for "getting the girl" he really and unexpectedly falls in. You have to watch the movie to see what I think. <br /> <br /> In addition to so many other elements of great film in this, it is a classic companion story, nostalgia for a time when the Second World War was almost over (the war ended about a month after the movie's release), a realization that a guy who is always laughing in life can find out that he really is a good person, good songs and probably some other elements of classical film making that I cannot think of right now. <br /> <br /> Why not a 10? Near the end - at almost 2 1/2 hours begins to feel a bit long. There is a little ballet number that Gene Kelly does, it must have been a feeling in 1945, but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now. But in general, this is a particular winner at all levels.
