Sequels hardly ever live up to the original. This is certainly true in this case. But if you are a big fan of the original then surely give this a watch. Although the camera's work is lacking, Brian Krause's character is annoying and the plot is clickable, it's much more fun than the first, and that's what I find entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, expecting the same performance as the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in his screenwriting screens, Stanley is off in Hollywood and is trying to lead his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a very different feel, but it is still good to see Stanley back in action. I give it a 6 out of 10.
