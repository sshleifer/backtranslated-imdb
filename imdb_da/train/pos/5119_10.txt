I just have to say this is one of my favorite movies all the time. I can't even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but for the first time the camera pans in his body after he is completely shaved and looks beautiful for his first trip to Gilley, I was in awe. Debra Winger always delivers a perfect performance as the Buddy's young naive wife, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you are not a country musician that I was not, there is 1 soundtrack that will make you sing along with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie - it won't disappoint.
