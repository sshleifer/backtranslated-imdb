An unconventional historical drama with some fine fighting scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance and gets some pretty good back-up. The script is literary and quite original, and the film is mercifully kept free of heroes. That said, it pulls a little and the last wheel is too much like a TV mini series. Still, Frederick Elme's camera work holds an interest in the boring bits (and now and then you see a shot that reminds you that he was working for David Lynch). Worth to see.
