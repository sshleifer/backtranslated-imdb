A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence kills a suspect by a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it. The Otto Preminger-directed movie has lots of atmosphere, but the story becomes the water when the dead wife (Gene Tierney) falls for Andrews. He did pretty well digging in and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel to a noir movie. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a crime commander Andrews is obsessed with bringing down, and the excitement between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially a scene in a bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night time rendezvous outside Bellevue Hospital, which sets out what should have been the film's conclusion. High marks for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the general notion of the underworld, though the angle of love and the simplified good policeman who does not help, is not to help.
