I first looked enchanted April about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, so their humdrum lives on them. They are very sad women at the start of the movie and you can only help row them as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite to share the expenses. This is perhaps the most feel good movie I've ever seen. It is clean and simple, without car parking, no enemies and no deaths. It was made with care and in very good taste. You can't help but smile all through it - except when you cry happy tears!
