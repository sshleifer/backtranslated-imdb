This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - which shows, and I mean it a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is heard by a wealthy Argentine (Roland) who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and immediately launches a targeted reminiscence on the last time Caroline decided she was in love with another: a dilettante-ish sculptor (Gardiner). The film plays the story of Anthony's strategy of decoupling Caroline from her sculptor and how that experience helps him with his Argentine. <br /> <br /> It is the perfect cast: Ronald Colman is the most sophisticated and charming Reginald Gardiner is at his most prestigious, Gilbert Roland is at his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just gorgeous. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production feels like a love force. There are wonderful touches that Colman breaks and addresses the camera, and outstanding use of a sliding bar door. It is a pity that it has not been released on DVD - it is the kind of movie that can raise interest in classical film individually.
