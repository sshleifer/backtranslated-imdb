I had heard that this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it and they all said it was great so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded the high expectations! It had fun parts, it kept me entertained with the action, and all the dudes tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was great as Nancy Drew. The rest of the casting was also very good. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys tried to kill us?" Corky: "Yeah, I was surprised too. In fact, just throw me out!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
