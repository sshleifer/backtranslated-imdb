While the film feels a bit long at times, it's well worth it. Gordon is in a style that reminds you of Vonnegut's written styles. Mercy, thoughtful, ironic, quirky and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for a while and beg for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful in a role that reminds us of Lynch fans from her Laura / Maddy days. Don't miss this one!
