I have to admit that I didn't expect much to go into this movie show in my Japenese movie class, but this movie really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job that comes with the title of his movie, which truly reproduces a picture of madness. I think the fact that this movie is silent adds to the equality of passion and helps the viewer experience the inner world of the character rather than the world outside his mind. This movie just added my feelings about foreign quiet movies vs. American, as the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think instead of going to the fluffy movie always with the happy end, as the imagination exerts very little.
