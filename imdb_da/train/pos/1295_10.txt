The book on which this movie is based was excellent; It took a while to address Houellebecq's unconventional style, but when I understood the mood behind the writing, I was totally drawn into the author's world with grief. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it illuminated my own personal struggle and has made it in vain in my own struggle to accept. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel and the heroes' apathy and indifference to a world that has rejected him is perfectly portrayed. This is a film that reveals today's society to the poor man in all its horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but at present we must accept the rat as shown in this movie. It is probably best that Harel or Houellebecq does not create a brilliant job like this again. One is enough for every man.
