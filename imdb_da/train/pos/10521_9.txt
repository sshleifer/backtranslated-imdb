Well, I suppose I'm emotionally attached to this movie, as it's the first I went to watch more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me through my graduation's thesis or rather keeping me working on it! <Br /> <br /> But by seeing it again several years (and many many movies) later - what a well done little gem this is! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where do you meet such a man ??? <<< suk >>> Sophie Thompson's tour as Mrs Bates is virtuoso with the finest (oh, napkins, excuse!) and the rest of the throw is no disappointment either - Toni Colette brings many Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor are convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! Of course sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute much to the feelgood, almost the Hobbiton-like movie's atmosphere - although it is about cinematography and art decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very very beautiful, but a little more tightening could have given a better sense of period. But the good thing is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's lots of fun - and some pretty cold editing program - that keeps it from sinking to sacharin Merry Old England fashion. <br /> <br /> My particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful actors and instructors here, and the final dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just beautifully. Too bad that the final proposal scene continues a little too long - cut two shots (I can think of exactly what!), And it would have been much more in line with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I just understand (by reading the imdb listings) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him - he has much more to go to him as an actor than just being a gentleman's English heartthrob! Hmm, guess I have to pay my video store ... <br /> <br /> Nice movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - but perhaps Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility is strictly the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and I've probably seen it many times! See it if you can - and don't be too hard on its small imperfections. <br /> <br />
