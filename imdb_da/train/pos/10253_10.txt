This movie has no history. It's just a bunch of guys who torture an innocent young girl. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> That's where they do it: They beat her, put her in a net, and let her hang in as a bird feed, turn her around on a chair until she is snatched, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her wound, crush her hand with a drag hammer and finally poke a needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> This movie was so realistic that if I didn't know it was fake, I'd have thought it was a snuff movie. Although I was disgusted with this movie, I really liked it. It scared me. I guess it fills some kind of purpose. I give it a 10/10.
