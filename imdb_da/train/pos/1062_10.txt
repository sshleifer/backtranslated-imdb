I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does such a good job in it. Michael Weatherly also does a fantastic job as well as the rest of the casting. The show is very exciting and they have wonderful stories and their stunts are amazing. It's like watching a 1-hour movie. It is definitely worth a look.
