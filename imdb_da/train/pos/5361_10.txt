If you were brought up on a game show diet, you would understand that you gradually need a bigger and better solution. Well in the Running Man's world your needs are set. In this game exhibition, the prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate prize - their lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of the mind-numbing tripe we see on a daily basis. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it's a very good movie. The underlying idea that broadcasters will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very credible and is very well portrayed in this movie. Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite is when he is being catapulted into the gamezone, the gamehow asks "Any last words?" Arnie says: "Yes, I come back", but the host quips "Only in a retrieval" and press the shutter button. I give this movie a 10 for pure originality. I must have seen it 30 or more times. The only movie except the Die Hard series, which I saw so often !! <br /> In short, do not think for a moment that you own T.V. - It owns you .....
