Now I have to say that this was a hell of a funny movie. Despite the fact that the duplication was pretty cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the movie seemed to be dark blue without apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: The last member of the marriage chamber must track the other five members and discover who among them uses their abilities for evil, and who uses them for good. The prisoner is that during the training the whole clan was masked, and everyone has since returned to society in disguise and changed their names. The fighting is a joy to see, as each member of the married clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The battle scenes have the actors jumping everywhere, and fortunately the camera remains planted and uses a big enough shot so you can clearly see all the action. The one drawback of the movie is that the story tends to pull a little in the first half until the first battle sequence. But stick to it and you won't be disappointed!
