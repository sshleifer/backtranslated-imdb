A nice old-fashioned thriller that comes as a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" follows accidents from the injured veteran oil worker N.Cage, as his luck gets weaker to worse after he ends up with an empty petrol tank and hardly enough money for a cup of coffee in an outhouse on the back. It has been established right from the start that Mr Cage may be down, but he is not out and he can be blown, but he will not steal, not even in his present bad circumstances. Thus, when he fails by Mr J.T. Walsh for the man he has ordered to murder his wife calls on Cage to warn her of her husband's intentions. In return, she, in Miss LFBoyle's person, offers even more money to murder Mr Walsh. Decides to leave while still in front, but when he leaves town, he hits a man in the road. As he was about to drive, he took the man to the hospital, where it turned out that he had been shot. Sir. Cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff, who turns out to be Mr JTWalsh. Events take an even more complicated journey when avoiding custody, Mr.Cage smoothly avoids being left by the real hitman on the way to fulfilling his commission. Now you can be forgiven for thinking "enough already", but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical event, the film's narrative stream at this point seems unstoppable. Sir. D.Hopper is comfortably cast as the recruited killer, like Mr Cage a USMC veteran. This little part of serendipity keeps Mr Cage alive for a long time - think the murderous trio and survive, a little more violent, but still uninvited. It is a tribute to everyone involved that what sounds like paper remarkably as a piece of nonsense is actually a tense, exceptionally well-made picture with fine performances all the way through. "Red Rock West" is a movie-lover's movie. With five minutes you know you come somewhere you've been to on many occasions, but you'll be very happy during the trip.
