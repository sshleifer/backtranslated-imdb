This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First of all, many of the action sequences are not that fun. The very first gun battle that occurs in the movie was just stupid. Not cool silly or even funny silly, but just stupid. It is not to say that there are no good action scenes, but most simply do not reach the level of some of the other movies I have seen. The opposite is that this film actually has characters, not just humans. All the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy who is flat as a billiard table), and most are quite well-behaved. All the protagonists of this movie are just fun to watch. The dialogue is rather witty and does not seem to lose much in the translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope that uninitiated American audiences don't think this is the best HK has to offer.
