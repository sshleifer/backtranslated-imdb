I just got back from a screening a few hours ago and I was very happy with the movie when I left. It's very intense, and the closest I've come to crying in a movie for some time. It is a credit to Adam Sandler, who delivers a grand achievement at many levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar nom, for it did not come out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual amazing performance that plays the right man to Adam's disturbance. There is some humor, but most of it is really just fun in terms of the tower-crushing moments when Adam treats his losses and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable, he is fun and sympathetic, but when he is, the less stable, he is powerful and dark. I recommend it to anyone who likes intense mental drama about difficult friendship and loss.
