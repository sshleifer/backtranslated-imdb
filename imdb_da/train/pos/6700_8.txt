Sitcomet was about a girl who has to learn to be responsible for her own actions. When she had the power of power, she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself, often resulting in letters that are often disastrous and always humorous. The program began with Sabrina's high school adventure in the fictional city of Westbridge, near Boston, Massachusetts (unlike Greendale in the comics). In the later seasons of the series, Sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college, and then continued with her attempts to live alone and hold a job at the local newspaper. The break farther from her comic roots ended the show with Sabrina's wedding, but eventually she left the wedding and ran off with Harvey. <br /> <br /> Many episodes involving Sabrina to meet through natural or supernatural means the popular real musical artists of the time, including Coolio, The Violent Femmes, Backstreet Boys, Phantom Planet, Davy Jones of the Monkeys, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Daniel Bedingfield, Hanson, Eden's Crush, Savage Garden, N Sync and Ashanti. Course of Nature, the band of Melissa Joan Hart's then boyfriend (now husband) Mark Wilkerson, appeared in an episode in 2002.
