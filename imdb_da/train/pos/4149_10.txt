Reading some of the comments on the bulletin boards here I expected this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I saw it I couldn't stop laughing! It's officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know what all the hat is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never existed before. I'm at a loss to mention another completely female driven comedy. Lots of comedies will have one or two actresses at the forefront, but there will be many supporting male characters. This was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's short appearance - and it worked. All the actresses provided very fun performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and gracious script. <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie seems to me to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, women's success in the public domain, the strength of female friendships, and the breakdown of gender. Although bright, each of the protagonists is faced with a challenge as their attempt to be more 'fun' with their feminist values ​​and who they knew to be. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle suggested that this movie missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get studios behind it and I agree. Everyone I have recommended this movie has loved it, and I think it is a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness is not widely accepted and successful. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind or love for female comedy.
