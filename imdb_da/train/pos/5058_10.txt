There should be more movies about our Indians. In particular, I think that by using actual real Indians, it would be the right thing. I know this Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job of portraying this character when he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to put more American Indians into the roles and never use anyone else. Sioux Nation has been put on the back burner for too long. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. It is my firm belief that our country must return to the Black Hills to Sioux. We ask Israel to return to their Arabs, but we do nothing to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
