When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in line with this movie, my expectations that I would watch the whole movie were low. The only reasons I gave it a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. What I thought would be a broad "Mrs. Doubtfire" type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar is completely trustworthy and empathetic as the ambitious businessman who is to release the female part of his being by crossing dressing on occasions. He sends these needs to the audience in a thoroughly credible manner. Julie Walters is magnificent, is like her habit, as the landlady, who teaches him unconditional love.
