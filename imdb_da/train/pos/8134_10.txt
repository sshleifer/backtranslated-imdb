. . . is as good as the original. Very nearly achieves greatness because of Cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue. Skewers the self-important swagger of hip-hop poseurs. The group "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) is every rap group you have ever heard and completely self-parodied. The wardrobe is incredible. Buy OOP soundtrack if you can.
