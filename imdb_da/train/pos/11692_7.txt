I'm not saying that as a Chris Rock fan, I say this as a person who had low expectations of going into this movie and was shown wrong. The first mistake was that it was everything that went out and that everyone seemed to come. Full number two, I found that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed false. Finally, the actor in this movie was sub-couple, with the best actor like Regina King and the worst was Mark Addy. but I saw past the error and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, watching the sky wait instead, it's better. So for all of you Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE, you will enjoy it. He has good stand-up in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
