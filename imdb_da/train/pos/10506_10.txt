Rated E <br /> <br /> I never own a Nintendo 64, but I've played many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I've played this game many times and it's good every time. If you have an N64 and don't have this game, try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side roll video games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is a bit odd, but there are lots of things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again save the princess and the 120 superstars from Bowzer. Now it can be done in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
