Ayone who whines about how this movie was shit or that it had no plot must have been looking for "Jean de Florrette". HI! This film was made to be a random comedy of comedy and in no way entails a plot in any form or form. I would also like to remind those whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this movie they seem to be missing the point. This movie is clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more appreciative that some people's sense of humor may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth away. <br /> <br /> Thankyou
