My comments on VIVAH: - It's a charming, idealistic love story with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The movie takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and groom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly treasure and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of engagement between two people. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the narrowed romantic moments between the spouse and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games make you crave for idealism. The movie presumably predicts with the marriage and the groom, at the wedding night, telling her new bride suffering from burn injuries: "Come, let me do your dressing" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - shows many good things - Beauty of arranged marriage, Beauty indian culture, beauty indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married .... playing by the rules! Simple but Beautiful; Such a simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does best. He has made the film with FULL CONVICTION. It's a very cute movie - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things during Arranged Marriage & Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO looks very good and she has done very well. She has most of the good scenes - though I thought the last half hour was all the way to Shahid Kapur - which for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked everyone else's actions for example. Choti, ie. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bridge & father-in-law. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has received another fine family movie for his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. Things like Sanctity in a Marriage / Relationship, Avoid Courts, Mutual Respect, Care and Space, Waiting to Get Married "Official", Prayers / Sacrficing for Beloved - All these and more are SHOWCASED in Vivah. There are still some good audiences going and enjoying this movie. Some of the people / audiences are already excited to have seen that they are thinking of arranged marriage :) It is successful if you ask me. it seems like AMRITA RAO - our Vivah actress {Good Performance Score} has been awarded the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE 2006 award !! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the movie ticket prices and other awards; @ least this is news for CHEER about !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO - to show us a visual image of Indian bride in the purest form and of course to Sooraj Barjatya to portray her the best way :) Don't forget Shahid Kapur and anyone else who makes VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It's no achievement !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - to take her career to another level with this award .... I feel personal - she should only film with Shahid Kapur !! They make a sweet couple and their chemistry on the screen reminds me of {SRK-kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br / > Some points that I observed few of the elements: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wear traditional dresses. She gives every part of the Indian woman the essence - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage .... but PREM listen carefully to the incremental speech that his DAD has given full faith in Anupam Kher. Finally, "Honesty" & "Trust" are the keywords that he reflects in his first conversation with Amrita. Most people would believe the first meeting with a total stranger, plus for a limited time it is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this movie, I have a feeling - that two people who are made into each other can connect within a 1st meeting, too, it is possible !!! # 3 In the whole movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. It is unlike most other romantic / wedding-based films where Hero & Heroine always sings / dances or today makes cheap things. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences: - Characterized by restraint, innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really liked the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinds of movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters / girls children in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic scenes between senior couples are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes, songs are beautifully depicted !! Words such as "Jal", "Praarthana" e.t.c. is going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this movie :) Personally, I really like many dialogues in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - Whole Hospital Scene where Shahid puts "Sindhoor" to Amrita when Shes fights for Life - is amazing. These dialogues between the couple are so touching and you feel LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; It's a Hats-Off Feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat See Qayamat Thank you, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the LEAD couple's freshness / screen chemistry:) :) *** IF YOU PROMOTES ME: - Together with films such as Rang De Basanti, Low Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is among the best films made in 2006. In fact, I think Vivah deserves better viewing / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all the time cards / fuzzy / style / crap movies !!
