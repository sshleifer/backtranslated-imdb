This is a very exciting short movie by David Lynch, and to say the name David Lynch is enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch card. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has cried, the brunette speaks in a threatening way for the blonde, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> With many silent moments, but with the scary music from Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange kind of excitement. This short feels a bit like 'Mulholland Dr.', a movie I loved, and therefore I liked this too. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance that you like it here.
