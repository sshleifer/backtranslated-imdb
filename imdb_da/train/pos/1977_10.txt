I really love this movie. I remember once when I was in 2nd grade, my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film roll. However, this movie may be a bit scary for 2nd degree as the scene where Bill kills Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my family members is ill to watch this movie because she studied it in the music class. If I were a teacher and could characterize the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them an A +.
