This movie was excellent, I thought the original was quiet mediocre. However, this got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4-speed transmission, which really shows that Mom Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler Heaven every time Kowalski floored the big block of Hemi, and he certainly did that :)
