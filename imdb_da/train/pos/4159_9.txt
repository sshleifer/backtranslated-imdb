Anyone who thinks about anime is nothing but sex and violence silence forever after watching this movie. This is a fine film that tells about Tetsurro's attempt to avenge his mother's death, but also grows in the process. The journey on the train is similar to Tetsuro's journey from boyhood to crew. The movie's music and visual styles are a bit dated (you can see it's a 70's movie) and the animation is just a little better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong, it doesn't matter. A must-see for any animation fan!
