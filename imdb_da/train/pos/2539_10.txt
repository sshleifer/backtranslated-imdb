For real filmmakers, this movie is a must, as it seems like a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science is about capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do damage or it can be used to do it well. On the one hand, it blinds her mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness ("I see!" Shouts a young girl whose eyes the light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the eerie force of this light, we see him actually sending out a ghostly light on his hands and face as a badly developed negative, noting that the man we see is a protrusion, a device seen on film (only visible as in a movie theater when the lights are out). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as informed by the fact that everything that happens is trapped in light rolling through space for millions of years, as the light from Andromeda was broadcast from the galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the movie when this new science is equated with older cultural vehicles: the author's, personality in Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblemed in the sculptural figures of the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector / beam gun. <br /> <br /> One must wonder whether this film was supposed to look at what was going on in Germany at that time and especially at Riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that would surely continue To do a lot of damage: Will's triumph. <br /> <br /> Finally, Congratulations, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes and reminds Janos Rukh of the first science rule. <br /> <br /> If only several movies made you stand up in the theater and shout: "I can see!"
