In fact, I really enjoyed this show. Even as a young man I was interested in all sports, and it was also horse racing. It would always be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the racetracks to record movies on this controversial topic. An episode I remember especially centered on a horse is expected to win a big race that looked a bit out of color. A syringe was found on the stable floor, and everyone thought it was drunk, but nothing appeared in the blood samples. Too late they realized that the horse had not been baptized, but had had knee cartilage removed. Like driving a car without oil, and the engine grabbing, the horse struck down with tragic consequences.
