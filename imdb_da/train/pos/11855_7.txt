Wow. Something of a surprise. Although it is defective, it is far better I had expected. The all-new spacecraft Arcturus with approx. 3,000 passengers are in the last days of their sixteen day trip to Jupiter. Without notice, the ship's cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon there are only a handful of people left, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the primary cerebral function <br /> <br /> irregularly. The remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. The opening commercially is a very good mark. There are obvious parallels to 2001: A Space Odyssey and to the historic <br /> <br /> sinking of the Titanic. The film sometimes slows down and has pacing <br /> <br /> problems, but is generally well-made and well-acted.
