I was forced to see this because a) I have a 11 year old girl and b) we had shown her the 1930s Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movie, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-abusive fluff I feared it would be. It was an unofficial, mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm glad they didn't try to "upgrade" Nancy to the 21st Century "hipness" (Veronica Mars has the title of modern Nancy Drew), I think they made her a little too bland that they didn't. don't do enough to develop the Nancy Drew movie could have been titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I must blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what to do with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script ...
