This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you do not like intelligent movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go away, and that's exactly what they get. The action is great, the end was not predictable, and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days. People complain that the movie is too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I actually like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. A note: If you notice this, it has just the same actors from Cube except four actors. Make it two notes: Wait for the credits (Trust me for this). Enjoy the movie.
