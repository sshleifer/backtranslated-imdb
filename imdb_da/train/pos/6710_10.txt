Sabrina Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V life stories: D I used to look back at episodes every day when I came home from school. So far, I think I've seen every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all relate to. She is fun, smart, outgoing, witty and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit very well with Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, crazy man create a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I have to agree that the school years are not as good as her high schools, but that does not mean they were not good. I think the end was great, though it wasn't what I hoped it was sensible, and I loved it anyway. :)
