Tom had a desire to make movies for a long time, and he did. It's as if he has visualized a dirty and worn notebook full of great little ideas, he has been filling and carrying around for 10 years. No supplemental character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just life and little magic. The balance, in speed, in the oddity of comedy vs. drama is perfectly weighted. This movie takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how wonderful it was. The music is great and your eyes are just as satisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, just a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly connected through a lot of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. in between the lines it happens. to see or not to see, this is it?
