An unpleasant, subtle and delicious movie, "The Man in the White Suit" is another fresh, fresh air in film format from Ealing Studios. While I suppose some modern viewers initially find it unclear, I doubt that many will not be charmed by the expert where the plot, the themes, and the characters have long been redirected during the film's course. The really great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a movie, perhaps not as overtly virtuoso as Ealing's inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time, he plays only a sign rather than eight, but as the indifferent inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the correct tone and expression. Along with Guinness's subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the casting is effective. Of the most important players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is convincingly absurd as the crippled but influential business size, while Parker is reliable as the ineffective but crucial mill owner and father. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, the beautifully lovely comic actress who is on her insurmountable top in this movie. Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a fine contrast with the correspondingly unusual but more maladroit Guinness. The scene, where she apparently tries to tempt him, is played so diligently by the couple that it is both deeply exciting and entertaining ... The themes are handled very effectively without any easy morale drawn. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and the workforce is insightful and enjoyable. Expert-supported by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically proficient in all areas; atmospheric photography, fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script, all quiet impressions. A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
