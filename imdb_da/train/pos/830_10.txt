I didn't have many expectations to go into the movie, but I thought it was great. Pierce Brosnan is excellent in a very different role. He's dumped the clever armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays to show he's an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play each other well and provide one of the better mate couples for a long time. The mood is dark, the shows from Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are good, blending it with a touching element of the story of friendship, and you have a good movie. This is probably one of the better comedians for a long time. This is a film that clearly shows that we can expect big things in Brosnan's career after the Bond era.
