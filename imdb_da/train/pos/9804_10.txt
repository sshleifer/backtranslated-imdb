"Batman: The Batwoman's Mystery" is as entertaining as the animated Batman movie. <br /> <br /> While still true to the comic's feel, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks a lot like he has before, but now he looks a little less impressive. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less vigorous, more youthful Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> As usual, Kevin Conroy uses Batman's voice better than most live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in live action Batman movies, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the bad guys. My all-time favorite, Penguin, is here. His design is slimmer than it has appeared before, and you hear more of the Burgess Meredith depiction of the 60s than the Danny DeVito portrayal of "Batman Returns." David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin's voice. The penguin is finally portrayed as a clever sophistication, as is most often seen in the comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a path that is much more memorable than the forgettable version in "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a descent mystery to solve, and puts "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" stands for.) The revolution to the mystery is a lovely creeping twist. <Br /> <br /> The result adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the movie. It sounds like a mix between the point from "Poirot" and the score from "Mission: Impossible." All in all, it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.
