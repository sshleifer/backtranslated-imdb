<br /> <br /> For the simple reason that this is a MYSTERY FILM, not a supernatural, I take the problem with the other reviewer's comments. It is not the only movie that has an apparent "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but turns out to be a very mundance. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind are Edgar Wallace's "Before Dawn" and the (more famous) "Mark of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The movie does a great job of creating a very "creepy atmosphere", similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets the throttle on the stairs of his castle or in the field of VAMPIRE when the two people see through the ruins of the ruins and see a "corpse" playing an organ while Luna falls with wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If you like these (often silent) atmospheric details, this movie is a must! <br /> <br /> Norm Bird
