I watched the movie in an example and I really loved it. Cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely fun. Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music, which will hopefully be released soon. I recommend it to anyone who likes British humor and especially to all musicians. Go and see. It is well.
