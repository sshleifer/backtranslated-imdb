<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a weird mix of sensuality and dullness. The movie runs slowly, very slowly, but takes a rhythm to tell a story of murder and passion. Jason Patric was never so sexy and powerful (the man gives a true performance), and Rachel Ward is anything but sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the pshycological heat, the footsteps of the past ... the flashback scenes, the weird character of Patric's Character, all become a sexy mystery. I recommend that this one cause is the sexier boring movie I've ever seen. Check out the love making scene, it's especially sexy.
