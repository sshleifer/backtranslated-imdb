I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I've been able to see for some time. The animation is fantastic. The artwork behind each landscape was beautiful. From the colors to the lighting to the non-standard ticket price. I was amazed at it. As you move beyond the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a story that is at the same time timeless and at the same time fresh. Character development is short, but these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to bind the viewer to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. I am impressed with the whole affair and think it is a must see for the whole family.
