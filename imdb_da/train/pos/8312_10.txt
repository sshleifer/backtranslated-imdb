Little Richard's life and time, as told by Little Richard, which produced and directed by Little Richard, was about one-sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but has good writing, good energy and an excellent leading actor playing Richard. All the music is by Little Richard, so it cuts a tight lipsync on each song. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, carrying through the formative years of music, the wild success and Richard throwing it all away to praise the Lord. Its all tied together well, and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles who opened to him. My main objection is that his outrageous countercultural behavior is underplayed and you get no sense of how his audience saw him at that time. Some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full strength. He seemed pretty much compared to what I remember about him at that time. The best scenes are Richard, who is jilted by Lucille and writes a song about it and the band for bikini shorts in progress to make point not to have a decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they had entered "Bronze Liberace" that Richard used to refer to himself in interviews, then there is a story. Believe me, I just watched him a few months ago, and he still flirts with the beautiful white boys and gives one a particularly good dancer in the audience, his headband. Nearly 68 and still strong I recommend this movie and any concert or T.V. look you can find. Little Richard is always on
