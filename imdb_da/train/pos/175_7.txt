A pretty average movie, but a brave from Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer & as a lead car. Although she ends up being justified, she is willing to portray herself as the dizzying bimbo. How many other A-listed actresses have been harmed by damage since this movie? Not many. Does that mean that the woman's skin can't be fun? Goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects others won't. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example, Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman would never cope. A wonderful performer. Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung.
