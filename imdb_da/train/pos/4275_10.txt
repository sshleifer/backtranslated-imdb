In fact, I am surprised that there were so many comments on this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a large American university. But no one in the United States has heard of it, which is a shame! The dynamics of the people is what makes it both fun and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus ride - anywhere most of us have been !! But I've never had one like this !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one where they stop the funeral. Then the man and woman sneak a little love in the woods, but everyone follows them to see without knowing it! Just as she lifts her skirt and goes into her all the way - consumption begins to hacking and they are aware that everyone is watching! Talk about surprised! But ... you really need to feel for them even though it's fun! When you see the end, it's kind of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did it! Serbian humor is the best!
