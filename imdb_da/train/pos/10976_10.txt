That's why I love this site! I watched this movie in the 1980s on British television. Over the years, one I have wished I knew more about, as it has been with me as one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen in my life. With just a few key words to remember, I track the movie here and much information, including the fact that it is becoming an off-Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, I can't remember finding this movie sad or exhausting. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter is firmly in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. You can think of Ironic, given the bias of their lives. Maybe it's because I live in the UK where fading greatness has an established language in old money, where dirt is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique depiction of tremendous spirit, deep and deep humor, whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect. In a way, I was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'. Over the years, as it faded into my mind, it shone the brightest, above all others, as a unique brilliant and excellent television experience. It was such a very private exhibit, it seems strange to think that being such a musical music from New York is so public. But maybe somewhere the daughter will be entertained by such a result. It is she who wants the last laugh maybe .. (They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O ')
