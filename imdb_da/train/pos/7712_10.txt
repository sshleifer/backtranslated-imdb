Level One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time at 10 am, I knew it would give me nightmares. It did. Surprisingly, as I recall, the sound was as much as the sight of the monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Level two, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the story of what it was: What if the harsh, uncontrolled instincts we all suppress became apparent. Level three, pure science fiction. The best way plausibly to realize The reason is "What if" is through the science fiction genre. This is pure science fiction, not "cowboys in space" passing for the genre today. After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all science fiction films. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, Watch Out!
