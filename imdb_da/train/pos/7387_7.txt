The events of September 11, 2001 represented his shadow at this one-minute silence Oscar memorial before memoriam montage, and there was little in the way of anyone singing all of the dancing comedy-riddles that we would expect from this award ceremony, but It was not a bad thing at all. Entertainment was more or less limited to a LOTR send up with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that was it. The rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations, and I have to admit that this was actually more fun than the overblown song and dance figures we've seen over the years, and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad presenter as opposed to the actual esoteric David Letterman from a few years ago, and one minute's silence for the victims on 9/11 was joking and dignified <br /> <br /> With regard to prices, New Zealand was completely robbed. FINGOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four smaller prizes, while A BEAUTIFUL MIND evasively picked up most of the big prizes except for best actor who should have been to a tough guy New Zealander but went to an All American nice guy instead. The only Oscar awards I agreed to, except those presented to FELLOWSHIP, were the prizes of best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both correct calls.
