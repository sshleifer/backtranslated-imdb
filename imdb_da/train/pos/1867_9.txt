This is a film about life, the triumph of adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I defy anyone, not to throw a tear at the end of the movie. This is more than just a tear, it's an exciting, thought-provoking drama with great performances from all casts, but especially derek Luke and denzel washington. 7 years on, I am amazed that Luke is still a virtual unknown, and Washington just adjusted another movie. Nevertheless, the story of this fetal child's trials and tribulations apart from a slow build and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of movie that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many fox searchlights, this was more of a sleeper hit and did not get the lot of critical recognition it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all foamy or it could have been unrealistic, but Washington did exactly the right tone , his mother never said a word and could only throw a tear while antowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving movie scenes I've seen.
