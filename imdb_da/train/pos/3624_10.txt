Rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role of perfection. The little boy playing his son was fantastic. He made this a father's son movie to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Missing hunting is okay as long as you try. The tension is palpable. I think this movie will be a classic.
