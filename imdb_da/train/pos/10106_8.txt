After 'Aakrosh', this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as an instructor. For this film was made, there was no audience for documentary film in India. This film showed a point that a documentary film can meet the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. It was one of the successful films of the year it was released. This movie challenged the big banners of bollywood as 'COOLIE', 'BETAAB', 'HERO' in 1983. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more like a hell of conscience every time he drove away or lost she was there to remind him. She was not a common heroine to do the usual things around the trees and shrubs. At one time she even gave her love, as the hero's recklessness touched the top. <br /> <br /> There was another character in this movie, which was played by Om Puri's contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah. He played as an inspector-alcoholic character. The role conveyed the message of the end result of an honest policeman who rubbed the wrong side of the system, which also gave viewers a chance to predict the hero's end. <br /> <br /> In his debut film, Sadashiv Amrapurkar was imprisoned with his cameo role, ultimately winning him as the best supporting actor in the movie play. The police in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality, he was able to adapt to the system to some extent. The anger that went half in his hand continued in Govind Nihalani's second movie "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew. Each played their role to a great extent.
