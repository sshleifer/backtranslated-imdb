Let's see it: the last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever had (mostly I have never found dry spells to last all season). But if you judge this show last season, it will of course come inferior. It's a totally unfair assessment - because the "That '70s Show" was a brilliant and hilarious sitcom on a bygone era and how the people who lived there were not as different as we are here in modern times. <br /> <br /> Okay ... ignoring season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace stars like Eric Forman, a teenager of a teenager with an eternal love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next to. Playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) gives amazing performances in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez, a foreign student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. What country is he from? Try to figure it out! For another type of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, just as Mrs Brady meets with Marie Barone, while Smith's Red is found mainly to scare Pogees out of everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, the chauvinist, but likeable Bob and the air-headed Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances like Leo, a stoner that acts as a father figure to Hyde. <br /> <br /> Apart from the anachronistic mistakes that pop up quite often and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come (and the regrettable last season), "70s" is a great show with great writing , spot-on direction and an emotional mood that pulsates through each episode. They are okay.
