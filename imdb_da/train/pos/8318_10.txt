An excellent movie. Great play by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as satin. This movie was one of the last predominantly "all black" movies from the 70's and, unlike "blaxploitation" movies from that era, this movie actually had a plot and it was very well done. The movie's soundtrack, which was sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R&B cards at that time.
