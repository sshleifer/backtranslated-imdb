This movie takes you to another time as there was another pace of everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that war injuries are not only happening on the front. Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our grandparents, grandparents, or parents went through during a war. I think this movie is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe are absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It is definitely worth listening to him reciting "High Flight" and making me wonder what he can do with Shakespeare.
