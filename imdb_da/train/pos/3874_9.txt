And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so sweet in this movie, and much different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where she was more like a man-eating. I think she should have been nominated for a Jutra. I think Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far better, IMO. Pelletier did fine work for her first time and I noticed that he was sneaking into a couple of his friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage & Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I didn't know they were going to appear. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I didn't like and this one is as good as anyone I've had the pleasure to see. And if you are in the states and wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave me it in less than a week.
