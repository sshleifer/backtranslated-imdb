If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did), just watch the movie, understand that you need to understand a basic element of Vonngut's writing - that outside his story, Vonnegut is himself and you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor just can't be transcribed by a manuscript or even the best play. I think this film exceeds the question of the most important issues Vonnegut puts in his book, but the frequent cynical moments of satire on the page are not on the screen. Does this mean that the movie is missing the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not attempt to restore the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those who are lazy to do a page). It succeeds because it takes the basic elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in a frame without pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books, where the director of course tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. I didn't want to place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands out on its own as a well worth seeing. However, by taking Vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie's story or trying to insert it, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly and retains the basic teaching of history without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
