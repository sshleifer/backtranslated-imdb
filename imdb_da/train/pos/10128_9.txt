Here it is .. the first EVER episode of friends where we are introduced to the Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), recently divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and ladies man (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) .This stage begins until we introduced to the 6th and last friend Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) .The episode is better than most people give credit to, as any new sitcom the first episode is not always fantastic, the action of this episode is not great, because the cast cannot identify and genuinely credible in their new characters (except Kudrow and Perry - who are shining). Matt Le Blanc-Man, his play was entirely pretty awful because so far he gets more confidence, but I think he's trying to be fun, but at least he fails. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer - why does he say every word? Don't talk normally! He became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he is not confident. and I can't sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston-look good and do a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season, Courtney Cox-Looks quite anorexic in this episode, it's worrying, She looks completely different now, (more healthy), she performs is a little sketchy, but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I make these two together because their comic timing and recording quality was great and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry basically plays! The section quality is improved later, "like the Sets, they look dark and incredible in this episode and make them seem unfriendly, the play is okay, the characters trust each new scene, and I'm proud, it's the pilot! I hope we can see friends reunite! because they will always be there for us!
