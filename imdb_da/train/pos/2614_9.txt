Why has this not been released? I think it should be a little bad, as it has not been. How wrong can a girl be! This film is in one word enchanting. <br /> <br /> You'll be jailed. It keeps your attention from the start and its pace never goes slow. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, the "episode" as it was (not giving away anything you saw in the trailer) is also inevitable. You will choose a favorite that you will be shocked, you cannot go and make a cup of coffee because you have to find out what is happening. Adrenaline rises and you cannot see. Cudos to the actors, it's very credible. And it doesn't stop there, they have a definite shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question reality TV and if you want to watch. And how far away from this are we really? Endemol (who does big brother) made a TV show in the Netherlands last year, offering a dying woman's kidney to patients in need of a transplant. The show was revealed at the end to be a hoax, apparently to raise awareness of organ donation, but do we get too close to comfort?
