What a fun movie! If you're a Giallo fan, the Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. Initially, it is difficult to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilty knighted woman who fears her life. Kill scenes in the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are particularly nice and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really makes the movie a good start. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s set and fashion are wonderful. In fact, all the picture players are interesting with the red Red Queen running across the bridge at night, as one of my favorite moments in the movie. The envelope plot kept my interest throughout. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score can be the best I have heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days. The only two questions I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the film's final. First, the murderer is all too easy to see. If you have seen more than a few Gialli, you have no problem determining who is behind the killings. Second, the end feels a little too hasty, and as a result it is a little confusing. I'm certainly not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but I admit to being at a loss to explain it all. Another view can just clean up.
