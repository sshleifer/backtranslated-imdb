I teach Japanese to an online high school, and I include cultural activities so students can learn about the country as well as the language. And to see "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can either buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students have told me that they have had the film so much they will get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could get a cleared TV version. I'm not really into the raw language that car workers use all the time.
