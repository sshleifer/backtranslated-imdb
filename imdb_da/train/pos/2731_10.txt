Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. She said Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extremely well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself. I agree! What a chilling and huge movie. I've watched over 2000 movies and would rate this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with customers like these regularly. My only criticism was the sermon at the end of the movie. Many people grow up in less than ideal conditions, but only one in a million will behave like these 2 losers did.
