This is one of my favorites all the time. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a mistake, it is coming to you as a raging bull. It does not go much into the viewer who attacked him. '' Scarface '' is just as lush and unconscious a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Morodes are slim synthetic that fits a tee. As the choir in a Greek tragedy strikes it and gnashes, meats and tugs, a constant reminder of Toni's unforgettable fate. Not so much a warning as a disaster in progress, '' Scarface '' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a railroad.
