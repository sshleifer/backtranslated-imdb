How really friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I was happy to see Old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It is the document of a long lost craft. (The best TV shows today can hardly compete with these old moderately good series.) CHANDU is deep, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It updates the mind. It's not stupid; Stupid are those who do not get the terms that such series work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. Without giving away too much. Chandu is an occidental magician who also goes after this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece from a Chandu exercising his supernatural gifts in a fairly discreet and moderate manner. <br /> <br /> As for the very sexy niece Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest Ubasti: the neat Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually many times kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent to sleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a false policeman; The Lemuria Temple and its strange, frightening ceremonies resemble the KING KONG images and is a barbaric mockery of RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl as brave as Chandu does? Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and completely heartless, mediocre, and it only contributed to his beliefs. He is the prototype, average drunk uncle, rude and cunning and oblique. It may sound like a pretty crooked greeting to Lugosi? But Burton's Woods biopic left me this impression of Lugosi and allies to a strong sympathy for the abhorrent actor. I enjoy Lugosi's fancy performances. <br /> <br /> This serial number is unfairly bashed.
