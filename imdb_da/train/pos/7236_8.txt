This movie is available from David Shepard and Cinema on before Hollywood There was Fort Lee, NJ, although it is a shortened version with just "behind-the-scenes movie sections. I'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had a movie print The original Blackhawk version resumed A Movie Romance, the complete function survives, but the preprint for this version had some nitrate degradation, and a few sections so poor, so why is Blackhawk's version edited . <br /> <br /> The movie has Tourneur, played by Maurice Tourneur, and of course he plays a caricature. Of course, director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg can also be spotted. <br/> <br /> Country lass Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man to sweep her away from her feet, dreaming of a troubadour that will awaken her, but is constantly interrupted by the only local boy, Johnny A pplebloom. <br /> <br /> Meaning Hile, a movie company from New York (actually New Jersey) films a western in the country. Mary sees an Indian (in full headgear) and raises an alarm - destroys a scene that the film industry films. She is immediately drawn to the dashed movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He urges her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When she comes to the studio, she discovers that everything about the movies is fake. The doors and walls are only apartments that are quickly assembled into sets. The long journey of the Western hero or the lucky jump on the heroine also works. The sets are at a large rotating stage so that the sun's angle can even be manipulated. The black companion in the studio signs all the movie stars' "autographed" pictures. The signs on the wall say "Positive No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the film's titles (which are nicely illustrated) emphasize everything that is false about the film-forming life. <br /> <br /> The movie star Driscoll is just as scary with the daily film production. He makes a temporary break from the girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to pursue this "exciting" maid. His plans are dotted when Maria's screen test is a stinker. We don't see the actual movie, but only the audience's painful reactions to it. Mary is destroyed, but she does not want to admit everyone in the home that she was a failure, so she continues to see Driscoll and we eat lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen, soldiers, cowboys, etc. Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with their movie "friends," she goes in to marry him, even though there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother looks, with a cake especially for Maria's birthday. This causes Mary to rethink his future. <br /> <br /> This movie has all sorts of fascinating scenes of study, movie sets, changing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you've always wondered what was happening behind the scenes when a quiet movie was made, this film looks behind the curtain.
