I first heard about this movie after buying the 1976 girl "Snuff". I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better, so I went naturally and ordered the guinea pig box. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out to try to ban either this movie or the other, so my interest was peaked. Devil's Experiment is a short film without history, no character development. Only 3 men torture a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like beating her and spinning her in circles over and over again and forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to high altitude noise for 24 hours, smashing her hand with a fence, burning, and laying magpie They burn, throw at her and eventually push a sharp needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> I have to say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the striking scenes. But then part of it was actually well done as far as rewarding you. The scenes where the woman is spun around in circles made me dizzy to see it. Or the scene where she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't close when I looked at it, but simply thought "Damn, it looks good for such a low budget film". I was fine, but I don't know if I can really recommend it unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 10.7
