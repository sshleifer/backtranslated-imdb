Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are unique and special in the halls of big movies. The scene where she is introduced to Kristopherson's unforeseen audience, against the wishes of the crowds and her, only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of "Woman In the Moon" is one of the best examples of films about how well a great performer can win over an audience. It is true. The scene where she records Evergreen ranks with the best in the company .. everyone lives, no lip-sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva, but she delivers on this. She is majestic song "With a look at you. She deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams got to Evergreen. Kristopherson also had his moments far above most of his movie appearances. This version of the" Born "franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March), although I will always enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason's musical remake from 1954. I haven't seen the DVD yet and don't know about its quality.
