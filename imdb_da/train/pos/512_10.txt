"Staircase to Heaven" is an excellent invention of film making, probably never duplicated. I rank it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it is a completely different type of movie than "African Queen". "Stairs to Heaven" is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects, which in my knowledge are quite unique. <br /> <br /> is the combination of B&W and color recordings - as in "Oz", but the meaning of the contrast goes far beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect obtained in "Oz." In "Stairway", the purpose and effect of contrast can only be described as strong. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Staircase" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How could anyone have thought of a better way to make time quiet? literally? And then there is the stairs themselves! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a true gem.
