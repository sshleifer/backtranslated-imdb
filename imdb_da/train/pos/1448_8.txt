Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition should take time to watch this movie. The movie is called "City Hall" and with a little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician called Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough knowledgeable to run a big metropolis with very little effort. His right hand is none other than deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally bright individual whose ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed to be destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites a survey with the tip of Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes the blame points to the town hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and a police officer are convicted of a career crime whose questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover of political payments and urban corruption involving Union leaders such as Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judges as judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party members such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) working for the New York trial service. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy, which is assigned to the unfortunate admission. A good vehicle for Cusack and a safe officer to become a classic. ****
