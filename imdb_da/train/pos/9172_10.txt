I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, and it left me with a fantastic impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of the Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and ordinary character with a strong mind and will of herself. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we saw the 1983 adaptation of history and it blew me away. The miniseries not only attempted to be true to Bronte's original text and the essence of history, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, named Rochester) captured the brilliance of their characters. I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to accurately portray Rochester. I say Timothy Dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his depiction by Rochester, Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature, holding in her feelings, like Jane in the book, the relevant moments of history, but allowing her fire to get into Jane's Passionate scenes: The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton depict in their scenes is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devotional relationships. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you haven't read the book before, you can see this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
