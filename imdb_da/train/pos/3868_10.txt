A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera's work, acting, steering and everything else is unique, original, great in every way - and very different from the waste we are unfortunately used to. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and exciting Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, her acting is unique - it's quite her own - neither "British" or "American" or anything else I've ever seen. There is something fascinating about it. The long, unbroken, natural shots are wonderful and remind us that we have become accustomed to a few limited ways of shooting and editing.
