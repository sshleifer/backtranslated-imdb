I must say, Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I have played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them have captured the sheer joy that this game tackles its horrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which is attached to the horror of our world, and it shows, as his hand is evident throughout this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Filled with lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. I just wished this had turned it into a console system, yet poor PC sales sipped one in the budget.
