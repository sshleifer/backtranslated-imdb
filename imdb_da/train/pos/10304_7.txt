"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me more like this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and makes divine forces of him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized here as God, and although it is not his usual type of movie or one of his best roles, he does great with what he gets to work with. Although sometimes raw, the film has a few laughs, from Bruce dismissing his soup half as Red Sea and customer reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly backward and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated, and there is some raw humor, but generally it is something fun. There is a decent backing, like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always help. The end of the movie turns out to be very romantic and tear, and the message is clear that we must do what God has called us to do and "be miracle". The film is far from perfect, but still fun and far better than I and many would have expected, especially if we see the film's deeper message. <br /> <br /> *** out of ** **
