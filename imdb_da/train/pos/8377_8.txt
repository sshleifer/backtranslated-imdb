My boyfriend and I have one thing for robots. So I'm trying to find movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Great. They beat the sound and beat each other out, with people's fate hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie's many flaws and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working on what was, of course, a tight budget. It is very hard not to like this movie. Because of the big robots. They looked like Transformers and they struggled as pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the crazy Russian villain, if he relentlessly stomping at his helpless opponents after they have already surrendered or complained that their proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste "like blood" (a line he delivers with a delicious campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he clearly has a ball, and the film is huge when he is on the screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cool reputation.
