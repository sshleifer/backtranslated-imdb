All in all, a good movie and better for the fact that the film was not made, the story can remain hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past, and the photography is amazing. For some, this may be too moody, for others boring - for me it is a mild, well-written story and perfect for family viewing. Now it's not something you get much recently.
