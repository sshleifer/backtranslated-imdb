Being a fan of the first Lion King, I certainly looked forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original. I know many Disney fans are cautious about the direct-to-movie movies, as I also have mixed feelings about them. <br /> <br /> Looking at The Lion King 1½, I was trying to figure out what my own point of view was about this movie. Should I be so fond of The Lion King that I want to nitpick on certain scenes, or will I just accept this movie as another look at The Lion King story? Most of the time I found myself embracing the latter. <br /> <br /> Lion King 1½ certainly has its sweet and fun moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon & Pumbaa, who takes care of young Simba and the surprise ends with some amazing cameos. <br /> <br /> However, I could have done jokes without many of the bathrooms, just as the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I suppose these types of jokes are for the younger set (which after all is the target audience. I don't think many kids are really worried about Disney's profit margin on direct-to-video movies.) <br /> <br /> But I would say I was a little annoyed as they directly bound scenes from the original movie to this movie. I'm just familiar with the original that these scenes just stick out to me like a sore thumb. Something would be different with the music or the voices as it would just distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it wasn't that bad, but don't expect any classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 had the lovely ballad, "Love Find A Way." With regard to voting, it was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a good job as always, and even new cast members, classical comic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson) did a good job. You can even enjoy these amazing talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disk 2 on the DVD. It is certainly a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> All in all, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it is sweet and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun, light hearted look at the Lion King masterpiece from our fun friends' perspectives. My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B (God)
