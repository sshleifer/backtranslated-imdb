I saw this movie without knowing what was happening ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare movie, and in the beginning I only saw it for this ... and I ended up with tears in my eyes because it great, great serenity, values, influence and courageous philosophy of Helena's girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programming (at least in Spain).
