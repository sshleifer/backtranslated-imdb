I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I can't understand why some say she's not. Boring....??? Maybe the one who said she's boring is because he's boring. She is a great actress and the film was excellent. It has lots of wonderful ideas and very good artists. The direction was great. I pictured myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems etc. When she goes to the sister's store, it's just amazing. Everything is fantastic. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
