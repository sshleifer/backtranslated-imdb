The first 50 minutes of this movie was pretty boring. It focused on the personal issues that Doyle had, including his sick wife, fans death threats, a trusted publisher and guilty feelings about his mentally ill father. Although these topics had an important influence on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the exciting seldom played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The location is good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is fine. If the first 50 minutes were so good the last 40 minutes it would have been a small masterpiece.
