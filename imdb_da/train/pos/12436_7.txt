I have read the modesty of Blaise for several years now and collect numbers of the strip. After the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie that wasn't based on action or violence. The director had focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty created based on her own story, and what parts of her life were influenced by her non-childhood. I think these thougths will give a greater understanding to the next (I hope) movie. I simply loved the old fashioned movies. <br /> <br /> But everything wasn't that good, gambling wasn't that good. almost boring and unreal. The action could also have been improved. I'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt right, the only reason he was there was so Modesty could have someone tell his story to. Also they could have expanded the film and show more about when she builds the "Network", but I guess it for the next movie. <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for my bad English
