First, I didn't know what to expect when I started the video. Whenever someone brings back a cult-type movie genre and adapts it to the present, something inexplicably lost in translation. <br /> <br /> This is not the case here. This movie starts right on track. It's a lot of familiar area, but it also manages to take it over the top too. Crockzilla scene anyone? It should be seen and just try to keep a straight face. This movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production. It is good to see that someone fills the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
