After watching this movie, I feel like I just know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for scary sake, and actually these elements are not missing from The Straight Story. But it's in a light I haven't seen from Lynch before. We begin with a simple family that lives a quiet life, but ends with a series of absurd, interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be seen by their introduction. Particularly in motion, the bar scene with two other world war veterans was discussing the events 50 years ago and how it still affects their current lives and feelings. If you're looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, it's the movie for you.
