From start to finish, I laughed really hard throughout the film. It is amazing that "The Groove Tube" may be granddaddy, yet the raunchiest, of all comic shit movies. This is the way I enjoy watching TV without getting bored by flipping channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, the weird, strange humor never stops! Just think about how all this nonsense's laugh can help you enjoy life easier! That's the way WAY better than Comedy Central or any prime time show! Do yourself a favor and waste all the soft, lame romantic comedy movies in the waste bin! Even better, tell your cashier manager you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
