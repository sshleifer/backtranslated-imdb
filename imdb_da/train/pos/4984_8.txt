"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps a beautiful campy all-time favorite of mine. The best and most fun from Kajawari Yoshiaki, known for the splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he did more campiness like this. My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence, the parts where Lord Helumis blows his fake henchmen, the party dissolves, the bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and reaches my favorite character, Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Check this out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for serious sophisticated Anime fans!
