'De Grot' is a fantastic Dutch thriller based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei', was made in the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' in 1988. This is not as good as the thriller (though much better than the American remake also called' The Vanishing '), but there are times when it comes close. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are great. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), who comes from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags, it is quite clear that he is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly aligned, photographed and acted. A kind of tension is created that you would not normally have in an opening scene like this. Later, we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both saying that they have never done anything like this. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), turns to a guy named Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, kind, and how Axel (as the adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Meanwhile, Egon goes and starts with a woman. Around this time he sometimes meets Axel, but will not really have anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as children, than as students, young adults and in the mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the movie goes back to when they were children and jumped back. Every time we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Smaller spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The title means 'The Cave' and it's the cave It gives the movie its happy ending, even though it is not so happy. Like the start, the end is fantastic. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and somehow diverts our attention to the first scenes, only to come back at that time in the end. It is the editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is also happy in a way.
