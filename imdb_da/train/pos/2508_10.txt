This movie is amazing. The reason was just ... wow. I was very surprised at Gackt's and Hyde's performance after growing up in the American world of actors who can't sing and singers who can't act. <br /> <br /> In this movie comes a young Sho (Gackt) over a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they constitute an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers from how he is forced to live by others, a vampire's half-life. It's a sad movie, but not juicy. The plot was very unique and unlike your typical vampire girl. The story was thick with twists and very entrancing. The only mistake I would say the movie, despite the lack of a happy - albeit peaceful ending, would be several languages. I had the non-published version (I'm lucky that I understood it all, rode some of the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. All in all, the movie was just amazing.
