The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexy up. Things that were only suggested in the novel are displayed on the screen for some strange reason. Do they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not showing everything to the right? Apart from that, this is very good quality. All the actors do amazing jobs that bring their characters to life. For the superficial women out there, it's worth seeing at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen, I would have forgotten it conveniently. I was still married the moment I laid eyes on him ... Sort of a spoiler ending scene is a fun turn of what happened in the book.
