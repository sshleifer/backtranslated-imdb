Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie from 1971. The film is almost exclusively filmed in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, not only with the theme of a broken family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister, as well as drugs and the hippie movement that got many believe that it involved the ISKON movement for the Krishna consciousness. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with scenes of drugs and is informed that the woman is dancing in front is the narrator's sister. Going back to the past brother and sister happily play alone about the house to hear their parents argue. This soon leads to a split in the family. The brother joins with the mother and sister with the father. As a year, the brother passes the search for her sister and is informed that she no longer lives with her father and that she has moved to Nepal. Here Prashant not only finds love, but he also finds his sister Janice. But he finds out that she is not only in friends' wrong company, but also on drugs, as she will block all memory of her past. With the help of Shanti, his love, his brother tries to get his sister away from all this, but has to overcome many obstacles, including people who bow down to every possible level to stop him. This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself Dev Dev and also stars Zeenat Aman (her first film), Mumtaz, Rajendranath, Prem Chopra, Jnr Mehmood, AK Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly delivered by the late R.D. Burman, whose final score was "1942 - A Love Story." During the film, Dev Anand asked Panchamda (R.D. Burman) to compose something special for this film. Days later, Panchamda returned with the composition of "Dum Maro Dum." The song was an instant hit.
