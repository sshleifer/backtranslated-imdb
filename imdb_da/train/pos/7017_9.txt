You spend most of this two-hour movie wondering "What is the story of the protagonist?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a low key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes are when you find out and it's a choke .... but you knew something was going to be dramatically revealed. Until then, Smith plays it mysteriously, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason to do that, but it is never really explained that we have to guess again. All that, including one over and over again, but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") can get some viewers frustrated or will stop this movie ..... but not because the final long segment puts all of it puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour movie and not the typical action packed macho Will Smith movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect can be to see Smith's drawn, sad face throughout this story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like he's lost and is sick. Smith does a good job showing a man who carries much sorrow. <br /> <br /> As a good movie will often do, this movie will let you think long after the final credit.
