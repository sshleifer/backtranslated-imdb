Jimmy Cagney constantly ran through this story of a stage producer struggling hard against the upcoming "talking" movies. This story of love, deception, women and dance is presented in such a way that you as a seer are never treated at a dull moment. The orientation of mass scenes in the test room was enormously well done. The story never got really crazy at this hectic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have been slightly dated, but that doesn't matter, because looking at this in a 1933 timeframe is fabulous to see this for many of the others features of movies released during that time. Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this movie, and he never loses his peace as the always-working producer of previews made for cinemas as intro. In this way he tries to save his ass from starting, he was a broadband producer before he started this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest, Nan, she gives such an exciting performance that is so unusual for movies from that time, so cool to see a woman portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions at the end. These were magnificent in themselves, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they just didn't seem to fit into the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that was what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had traveled throughout the movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way, "Sitting On A Backyard Fence" was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to end this hectic paced story, and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence, and then I realized there was another two coming up. These sequences also got a lot of chuckles from the audience. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fantastic movie with a sour ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
