Let me first say that before sunrise, like any movie, is not a movie for every taste. It seems that some people are less wise to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to consider the kind of completely disliked this little harmless movie generates from some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise hit a deep chord in me, I was really stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one view. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you may possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational emotions I got from it. <br /> <br /> The film acts as a community of two fragile souls who begin to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how a conversation necessarily ties into the next or the meaning of the topics in Jesse and Cine's discussions, but rather the small nuances, the perfectly articulated responses that they evoke from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, but fleeting human feeling that begins to flourish in the awesomely sublime Viennese environment; It convinces us that their evanescent conditions can be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt that they will not again each other. <br /> <br /> The clear comments from RockytheBear and the below users are hopeless examples of a doctrinal dissent who is unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> See it and it can change your lifestyle.
