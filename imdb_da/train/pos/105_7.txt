Must start with Ed Furlong on this one. You must. God bless this child. $ 5 bucks says the character he plays in this movie is what he really likes in real life. He has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years, and it doesn't even seem like Furlong himself is acting. Perhaps that was why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like this in real life." Should Madsen act himself? Just natural. Vosloo has, of course, moved on from the type-fed Mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise for this movie was the performance of Jordana Spiro. Her reactions are spot-on in this movie. I fought if she was warm or not, but realized I just wanted to see more of her. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of the shoot'em out / hostage movie. But what I'm a fan of is movies with lots of twists and turns to try to keep you guessing. It's not just your standard robbers who take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good boys win at the end of the movie. The twists and turns continue ... and come. The cafe scenes work best with handheld cameras to show what it really is in there. Don't gloss over. Think like the Bourne Ultimatum "little" style on some scenes in the cafe. And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) makes you do a double shot. These guys are twins. As I looked at, I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents, and what are they doing in this small town. Eventually, these people smuggled things to other countries / states so they could have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this movie to international audiences with some of their stars that we may not have heard of. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? Should I say more.
