A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes out for a family together in some remote houses in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This attacks some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started seeing this. The majority of the reviews on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I disagree. First, it's NOT a horror movie. The fear doesn't even begin before the final 30 minutes. It plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. At that level, it's pretty wrong. <br /> <br /> First - the bad things: The pace is way too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; Way for many false dream sequence scares; Wendigo is hardly figurative in the movie, and the clear view we get from wendigo at the end is ridiculous. The Good Things: Pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; A really good direction with scary sound effects, which is a little scary; a rather explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for plot integrity!); Good play by Sullivan (only 10 at the time!) And Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. I think many people are annoyed with this movie because it is being pushed as a horror movie - which it is not. So if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I give it a 7.
