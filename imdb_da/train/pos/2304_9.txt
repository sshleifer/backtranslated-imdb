I thought this movie was very well done. In place in the mid-1950s everything looked right to me. It was well cast and trustworthy. I usually don't care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth, but I felt this movie deep into the characters, and you could feel how they felt you should really know them and worry about them. It took me back to my youth and remind me of a more innocent time. This film can be enjoyed by both man and woman and by all age groups. After the film was over, I wanted a lot of two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it, try to catch it when it's on TV or rent it ...
