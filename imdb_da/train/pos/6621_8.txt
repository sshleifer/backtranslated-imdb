I just came back from a pre-release view of this excellent sci-fi movie noire. It's style is finally unique and very well made. It's filmed with actual actors, but turned into a black and white cartoon style you've never seen before. It goes a step further than Sin City, and it does well. It is a successful combination of French comics and film cultures. The story and the mood are reminiscent of Blade Runner, and if you liked it, you would probably like it too. The story is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. This movie is a must-see for any cinephile except maybe those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b & w.
