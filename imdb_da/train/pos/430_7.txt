This was a very good movie. I did not go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the play, the manuscript and the landscape. Miranda Richardson was amazing and it was Joan Plowright. They stole the show. But the other actors also played their parts wonderfully. Very entertaining movie.
