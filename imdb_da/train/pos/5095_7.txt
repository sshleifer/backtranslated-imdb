King's Salomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (plays Allan Quatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa but decides it's time to return to England and be the father of his son. He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of having custody of him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and is being held by an African tribe for solving the card, Elizabeth's father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good draft of supporting characters that go together with Quatermain and Elizabeth, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the card too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention to the end. Patrick once again plays a robust handsome, honest man who comes to rescue the girl in distress. Patrick is an amazingly dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the robust quiet thought, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Mind, his character actually smiles a couple of times. I really want to see Patrick Swayze again in a relaxed live-loving story where he doesn't have to jaw his jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But it's a good movie for the whole family and worth watching.
