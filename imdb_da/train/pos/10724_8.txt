This is one of the good Saturday afternoon movies. It's right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a sweet movie with a lot of subtle comedy to ease things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I really like movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a good story line. And I would never have known Mr. Phoenix, if I had not recently read the credits. He was just a baby really when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was also the young budding actress. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree that it is not an Oscar caliber film. But much worth seeing. Especially if you have children, let's say that the 8 to 11 year old range. Or those who are interested in the space program.
