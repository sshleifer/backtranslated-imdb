Why is crap this movie rated so low? I've watched this movie over 25 times, I know every line for this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) are starring Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish." Mostly they are just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Just as the movie starts, it reminds us of the money that is hungry corrupt the world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as making an up called "Townsell". I have to quote this part of the movie, as it is true with some sports start: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Argano routes, plus a season bigger at the Desert Inn I am happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami. "His agent leans over:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize that they are still nothing when talking to their old classmates. Outside, they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what was probably high school basketball heroes. After shaming them, the sport goes on for a year. During this time, they recruit their third teammate Squeak, who is actually one day after inventing the game. As the film follows, we find out that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left behind. The story comes with zany extortion, Milwauke's Beers cheerleaders and humor so absurd it will let you cry for more. See the guy, it's funny.
