Okay, I admit that the casting in the movie is really weird - part of this is due to the plot, but I still had a little trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan played this lead (though he did really good work). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of an Englishman who lived with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came from all over the world to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness drive - even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked! The film is centered on this, and what happened when the hoax was uncovered. <br /> <br /> The action and settings were great and I really liked the movie (when I suspended disbelief over Brosnan). It was not widespread distribution - probably because it was rather cerebral - not a Bond movie or a romance - just a really strange movie about a remarkable man.
