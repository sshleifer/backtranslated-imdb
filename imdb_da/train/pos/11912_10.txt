I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his cheesy action and semi-complicated script. Many people complain about the "confusing" plot for the first movie, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a stupid stone plot with the same super action to carry it through. <br /> <br /> One gives the name of the first movie's hero Alex, to a skim superwoman sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. Much of the movie only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem a bit authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to go back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, it's a piece of shit (not what the first one was good). There are subgroups that involve Africa's political turmoil, treasure hunt and tribal battle. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things get a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn battle with some chases that boil down to the babe vs cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality or any of the first movie.
