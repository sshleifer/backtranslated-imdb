The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a slice of the normal man-vs.-woman-arguing-all-time-but-wind love-type Hollywood screwball romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> I don't usually go for that kind of movie and the tedious story, but this one was refreshing, fun to watch and charm. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very nice couple. The support molding is excellent - from the always sympathetic Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for a while when something dramatic happens to him. The "twist" is another reason why this movie rises over others in its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a good example of that. In this movie, it is romance, comedy and drama, and it's well done. I take this over the re-launch "You've Got Mail," any day. No comparison.
