I saw it many years after the TV series, and at first it didn't care about it. Then I looked again as my memory of the series and it was quite fun. Based on scenes by Neil Simon, it has not been 'opened out' much to the big screen and it is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the support aids are wonderful, especially John Fielder as Vinnie. Even now, some moments can reduce me to the laughter of laughter - Felix interrupts Oscar amidst a ball game with a dinner search, Oscar jumps up and chases Felix around the apartment, the giggling 'Pigeon Sisters' brought low of Felix sob stories, and of course the legendary cafeteria scene (later ripped off by Nora Ephron's 'When Harry Met Sally'). Sharpening dialogue too. When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: "They could be vitamins! He could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
