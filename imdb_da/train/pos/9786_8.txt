I really enjoyed the performance of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances where the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with shifts between tides. Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions that lose power and the effect of a large employer closing in on a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the older man should be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without him being nice. Depth of character can appeal to it not so shallow. The film has a good appearance, and the cinematography is also good.
