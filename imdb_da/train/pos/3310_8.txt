In the film Kongwon-do u in him, it is a relatively intimate insight into the meaningfulness (as well as the general meaninglessness) of various Korean lives; Empty people seek ways to fill themselves, enjoy nature's escapism. From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe the fathom of the various characters; we learn about their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity trapped in human life (and yet man's everywhere simplicity). Although the film is slow, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any ideas, but allows the ideas to come about, it allows the concepts to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie ends as well and suddenly as it begins, and you really understand the meaning of loneliness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes we make. It's a look into everyday life, very good and beautifully done. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action or for intense drama, this is not the movie for you. But if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful movies that aren't forced and without glitz, it's a good movie to watch.
