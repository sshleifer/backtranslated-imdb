Now there's a movie right out of my childhood, my family used for wallpaper; but that kind of was dropped over and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to see the whole movie on youtube.com; I had loved this wonderful movie when I saw it as a child and after seeing it again (online) I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember the sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (on whom animated who) that some of the animators date back to the 1930s (WOW! It's like 47 years).
