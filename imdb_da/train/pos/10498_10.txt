It's a little light. It's about it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except that some of the fences are 2d, but it is forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything from talking to SFX is comfortable and realistic. The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it is the same for all platform games such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then I have dutifully got 120 stars over 10 times.
