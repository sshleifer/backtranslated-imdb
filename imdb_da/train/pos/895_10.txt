I've seen this movie. This movie is the best for today's needs. Dowry in marriage is the biggest problem today. By specifying this problem, this movie is the best. In this movie, the Indian values ​​are stated very well. Today's youth must understand this problem. There is less girl population. And because of this problem of breakage, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, the day when there is no girl child is not far away. So keep in mind this statement, today's youth must understand that we cannot take dowry in marriage. We must learn from this movie that dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in society. This is the major change in society.
