It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it had a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, it was a lot of reason to cover. <br /> <br /> It was sometimes soap-operated, but also had some visually dramatic moments with a grasshopper attack at the end of the movie. It was amazing to see. Considering this movie is about 70 years, the special effects crew of this movie did a spectacular job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day, and they do not disappoint here, both providing powerful performances. The only problem is credibility, since all the Asians are played by caucasions, and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just don't look real. I would like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but just to make the story look and sound more credible.
