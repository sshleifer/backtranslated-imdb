There is a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable toxic gas. Before he can reap the benefits of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hoodie whip. After a co-ed is killed in a church by the gas, Scotland Yard is urged to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. What doesn't like a murderer sneaking around with a live red KKK outfit, complete with red gloves. The white whip he wears and uses very efficiently stands out well against the bright red dress. Though the idea of ​​a killer in a fiery red, pointed outfit sneaking around a girl's school is quite removed, it is one of the more eerie fancy costumes I've seen. - Groovy 60s Music. I really want to track the title music of The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy, hip, 60s feel to it, I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. Aside from the killer's red dress and hood, the movie features a sliding fireplace, an alligator pit with a cage handling, spray guns, a strategically placed mannequin, mini skirts, go-go boots and mile high hair. I would describe it as a cross between the 60's Batman TV show and an Italian giallo. College Girl Murders is a great experience for the eye. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say there are more turns than a mountain road. When you think the killer has been uncovered, does a twist come? .. and another ??. And another and another. <br /> <br /> What doesn't work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was supposed to be comic relief, but his buffoonish character has too much screen time. Why does Alligators have? Earlier I mentioned the alligators in the cave. And while they are a good mark, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders have no flow or rhythm to it. There are far too many moments in the movie when things become inexplicable to a scary stop. Better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie. I have not seen many of these German crime writers, but of the few I have seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of London) this can be my favorite. This one has a really funky feel for it that I really go into. Had the plot flowed a little better, I could easily have given The College Girl Murders a 7/10.
