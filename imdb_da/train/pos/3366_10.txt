Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and great executives we have secular citizens, is not yet available on DVD ... (summer 2001 right now ....) Mysteries of goggle mind. <br /> <br /> This grand classic returned to the theaters of my hometown thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer retrospective and to watch it again on the big screen after all these years watching it on a video tape. .. it is a true gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid a criticism but still try to prove a point: I took my reluctant younger brother with me to watch this movie. He never saw the movie before and "doesn't like the Italian oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, he was fascinated by this wonder. Even under the final titles, the theater was completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A marvel at sophistication. And a big loss if you haven't seen it (yet) ...
