Otto Premingser's Dana Andrews cycle of film noirs is among the (largely) unsung jewels of the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have been out in place at the time, but the clear eyes, the complex game of identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological principles, the tight geometric style all seem originally modern today, and very similar to Melville. The light irony of this movie is so loaded, brutal and ironic that the 'happy' end is one of the most horrible in Hollywood history. Brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller too, tense and packed with double-sided dialogue.
