John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the biggest horror movie all the time? no .. maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and always will be. The movie is pure genius and will always keep a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that I could not see this movie until twenty years after it was released, but even twenty years later after so many slasherkopats had come and gone, the film still had the same effect as that must have done then. My dad suggested before going to Halloween H20 that I whip out and rent Halloween 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after looking at Halloween it was quite clear that it defined and put Slasher Genre. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher's knife. Captured for fifteen years when he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown Haddonfield, where he begins to pursue three young girls: Laurie Strode an innocent bogworm, Annie Brackett a hard and talkative sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful and sexually strong young girl. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here, listening to the help of the city's Sheriff Leigh Brackett, who is still skeptical of his story of the psychotic killer. Michael sees the girls mercilessly and starts killing them one by one until only sweet innocent Laurie is back, the primary target of Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic in his first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting performance with its small role as Loomis. Nick Castle, depicting Michael, did an excellent job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of this movie is the chilling score made by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. Blue Light was scary and effective, and one of the great moments in this movie is when young Laurie fights against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her, Michael's face materializes before he hits. Michael's mask was one of the things that sent shivers down my spine the most, the white numb face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that it's not a horror movie as opposed to the cheesy Friday The 13th movie, in fact there is little blood in this movie and works instead on voltage and voltage. <br /> <br /> It became so clear that Halloween sped up movies like Friday the 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, which he is just rip off by Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in your life, as it is a milestone in film production and undoubtedly is the biggest one of the greatest horror movies at all times.
