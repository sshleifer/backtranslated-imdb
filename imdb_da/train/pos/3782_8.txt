When I was a kid, I completely loved both Bill & Ted Movies. The second night, Bogus Journey was on, and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it, I decided to tune in. And I loved it all again! This movie is still fun after all these years. 'Excellent adventure' is better, but one rocker just the same. Sure, some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is cheesy in a cool way. Plus it has the coolest personality of death ever in a movie! Final: Totally non-fake filmmate! Excellent way! STATION!!!
