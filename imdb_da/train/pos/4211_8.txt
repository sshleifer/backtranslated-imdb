Last night I watched TV (HBO). I must admit that the excitement of this movie was unmatched by most other UN film films. I loved the way Chip would be all quiet for a moment and then WEIGHT the very next moment. It was classic. Ahh yeah. The ladies, the villians, the cigars and the thuggish police! It has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they blended communism into the plot, very common to this era of film. Very bold too, since blacklisting was popular these days. I rate this movie one of the best I've seen in the UN genre!
