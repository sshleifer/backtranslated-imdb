A typical Clausen movie, but again not typical. Clausen writes, leads and plays one of the leading roles. This is really a good movie about normal people who live normal lives trying to get the best out of it. The 4 primary actors were amazing. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who really is an actor, but it turns out she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> Everyone has problems and those who no one believes in are happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their life and love.
