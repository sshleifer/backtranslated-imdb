Without Kirsten Miller, this project need not be completed. But with the awe-inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It seemed that the other actors only played to her strong performances. Wagner's poor attempt to honor this movie was a little disappointing, but his few scenes did not detract from being entertained. For the most part, my criticism of the writing and plot line, the group of talent gathered together made a heroic effort to save what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing was impeccable and credible. She plays the fine line between assertive and bossy, but never offensive, she is actually the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky to rent it before it was lost.
