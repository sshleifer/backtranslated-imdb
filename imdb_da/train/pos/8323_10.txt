"A little mist from time to time is loved by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Fantastic treasure, wonderful premise, period piece made with acute eye for detail. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just amazing! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
