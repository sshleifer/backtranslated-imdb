A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a good movie for people of my age. The story is about a bog called Flik. He led to chaos at his colony when he destroyed the food for the superior grasshoppers. He is banished and he has to find bigger mistakes to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant, especially in the late 90s. The story is good, but a little more detailed would suffice. The voice action is good as with most animation films. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it got a nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie hit me as awestruck. This is a great movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
