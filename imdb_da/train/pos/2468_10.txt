I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs. I figured 4 hours would be great, I've been a fan of Branagh; Dead again, Henry V. I was totally overwhelmed by the direction of acting, filmography that this film was taken. Like other reviews, they pass 4 hours fast. Branagh doesn't play Hamlet, he's Hamlet, he's born for this. When I see this movie, I constantly try to find mistakes I have looked at goofs and have not noticed them. How he could move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was shot in 70 miles. It's a pity that Columbia hasn't released a Widescreen version of this on VHS. I own a DVD player and I will take this over Titanic any day. So Columbia, if you listen, puts this movie out as it should be! And I don't know what happened to the Oscar. This should have swept the best picture, best actor, best direction, best filmography. What movies were they watching? I was sorry Branagh at the Oscars as he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have been a tribute to Branagh for bringing us to one of the greatest movies all the time.
