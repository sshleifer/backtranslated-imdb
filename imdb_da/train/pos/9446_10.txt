James Dickey is a wonderful descriptive author. When you read "Release", you are immediately transported into the lush rear of Deep South. When you look at John Boorman's film version of the book, you are aware of how precisely he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the story. The characters are fully realized and the portrayals are amazing. I first saw this movie in 1992, after my freshman year in college. I was in a phase where I watched movies that were all released within a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All President's Men"; fine movies, all together. This one was easily the class of the group. It says a lot.
