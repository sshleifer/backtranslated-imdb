Pushing Daisies really is a landmark in Television as an art form. Everything seems to pay tribute to Amelie and Tim Burton, but then what in a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this show will guarantee that you don't care whether it's fresh or not. It's just Brilliant. I've been imprisoned from the start, the intelligent writing, Directing to the backgrounds and the dialogue making this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and the Wire (ok not really good comparisons, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it doesn't have any TV comparisons). Really addictive and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps as one of the Piemaker's pies mentioned in such tantalizing ways.
