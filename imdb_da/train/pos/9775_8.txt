Tears of Kali is an original yet deficient scary movie killing into a cult group in India consisting of German psychologists who have learned to control their will and their bodies to the point that they can make others stay "cured" through radical techniques (which can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release the muted demons within them. <br /> <br /> The movie is shown as a series of vignettes about the Taylor-Eriksson group - the above cult group. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but serves well to create the premise for the rest of the movie. The rest of it is played as a mindf @ ck movie with some of the most important staples thrown into the mix (full frontal nudity, some gore) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I say check this out. Don't be spectacular, but it's concept is beautiful neat and it delivers in the right places. 8.10.
