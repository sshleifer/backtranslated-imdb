One of the comedies from the 1970s. Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. The story is about three people who share an apartment living above their homeowners George and Mildred. The comedy rests on the mix of the people who share. One man and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is obsessed with Paula Wilcox. It played in a gentle and not a leisurely way, why this show was a success. Scripts and stars always gave the best performances, and Richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm. The final titles contained visual jokes that went unnoticed in the early 1970s, but worried they were living attendees live events.
