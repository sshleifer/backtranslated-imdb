This movie has scared me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother had seen it when it was telly back in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings when my father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like "Don't let her get me" or something. I asked what had made her so sad and she told me she had seen The Woman in Black. So of course I had to see it, and even though I was only eleven she let me. It scared me out of me. I've been immune to horror movies since I saw this!
