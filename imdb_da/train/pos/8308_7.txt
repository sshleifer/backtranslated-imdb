It fits on a musical Sunday to get your heart pumping, and no one can do better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers from the ladies and defined rock and roll. Look to Leon to give a final characterization as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: Alan Freed Story. This was a fascinating biopic when we saw Little Richard fight with his father, with his church, and with himself over what he was. He won the fight and there is no one else who has his voice or his style.
