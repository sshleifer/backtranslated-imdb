When I was very young at a local TV station, they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. I saw lots of Kung Fu movies this weekend. I can remember many of them. I saw big flicks like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist by Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoo Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I remember the day clearly. Me and my dad had just had lunch at Burger King.We drove home to see what movie it would be this Saturday. We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, turned on the kit and threw it at 56. The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it. So underneath it was the title of the movie. It said five deadly venom. Then the movie began. I tasted my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie the moment it came. My favorite character was the Toad Venom. The reason was hard to follow in that age, but it wasn't that lured me ... it was the fighting. The matches were so ... amazin g.I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie I ever saw ended.
