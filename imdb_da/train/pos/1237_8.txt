This was a very original decent movie, and a brave move for everyone involved. I don't care if it's not the best movie of the time, the fact that Eddie Murphy has to do something non-formal, and I don't know what will happen next time, make it my favorite. I wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.
