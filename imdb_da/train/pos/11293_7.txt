William Wyler would have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway game with music / recruiting poster vivant, but his own military commitments went in and went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "Women's Director" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, especially in wartime. Certainly, the whisker (and whites, spades for an unbilled Chinese-American recruiter) bunch of novices are nicer and healthier than in real life, and talk about home and mother, and wife and child get pretty thick, but is effective propaganda and undeniably stirring. Also noteworthy for the military male cast, several of whom do not reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in a row like Andrew's sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up to an hour and a half in the picture, but has some nice little sequences like O'Brien's worried sick Brooklyn spouse. Sin, its rights are in a tangle and the only print that knows about is 16mm; Obviously, after Twentieth Century Fox has released it (to great success), the rights have returned to the army, and if there is a good 35mm print out there, it is probably somewhere in the Pentagon's gut. It's scary and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the war graves, and it deserves to be more widespread.
