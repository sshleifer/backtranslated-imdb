I finally watched this movie all the way through and I have to say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- it's not just the fact that she * can * act, but she chooses the roles best suited to her who are more meaningful and important than what first seems. I have read a few comments that express their relief that this was nothing terribly feminist as they believed in advance, but I totally disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself as opposed to what almost everyone is thinking of her (with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her trainer and leader, Hector, who turns out to be more than her true parent), which is what The word "feminism" is about. It is good to watch movies as this highlights the real side of feminism - that they are not a bunch of male losers - but that they have dreams and can do something. Diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship rather than just something that works magically. Girlfight is a true taste of reality, and it leaves some faith in my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie related to not only young women but everyone who wants to go a long way in their lives.
