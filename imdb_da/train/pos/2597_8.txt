Ulysses as a movie should in no way be compared to the novel, because they are two completely different units. However, the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to draw power consciousness. I think it's the best movie they could have made with the material ... and it is from someone who routinely ranks films that aren't like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the film is still entertaining.
