Why aren't more movies (especially American) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I'm accused of "electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball Machine" as my first attempt. This is a review so I will try to hold on to pure reflection and gut feeling. <br /> <br /> I think this is a creative work, though clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it's not all original? I own both of these films, and although Tetsuo is a strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be put through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind that changes drugs to clarify the meaning of the movie. The Meatball Machine is so elaborate in its history as it is in its great influx of blood and gore. Thanks Jesus for Japanese cinema! <br /> In short, the last time my dreams were exceeded by horrors of horror, it happened after seeing nightmares on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a phone in weeks at the end. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly inspiring. In this film, human bodies are for foreigners whose sole purpose is to try to fulfill their infinite extinction of human flesh and blood. People become meat eating cyborgs !!! There is more !!! Fight scenes !! Great music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent acts by the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The battle is finally seen, worth looking at ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but it takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I can't wait to make friends watch this movie again just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family don't understand the Meatball Machine. The truth is, America as a whole is not prepared for the Meatball Machine. Finally, my wife went in while I was looking at the climatic battle scene at the end, and she was speechless. Usually she says something like "why do you see it unwanted?" This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not undesirable. This is not just splatter (splatter for splatter sake is also amazing). This is art my friends. Nature. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
