A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her twilight and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and uncle (Barry Jones) that she loses her thoughts and in a very delicate state that requires their supervision, which turns out to be more like manipulation as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible. The only other person she sees is the property guard, a huge character played by Maxwell Reed, who has captured the colored eye of the medieval aunt. All of this has aunt and caretaker, the butterfly's uncle who has a serious underside to him, and the receptive niece in the middle, made for a darker and scary movie. As it is, sending a frame to a murder Trevor Howard (a fired government secretary who took a job on real estate cataloging butterflies) and Simmons across the landscape fled the police and caught headlines of "Police Net Closing In" over her cover photo, jumping on buses and settlements in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully cast characters, and finally face the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
