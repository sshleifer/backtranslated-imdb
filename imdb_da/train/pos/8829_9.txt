Several directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger expiration for their talents. 7:35 The la ma√±ana are absolute genius. What Nacho is capable of communicating in 8 minutes takes some Hollywood directors to film hours. I saw this smiling, but felt a bit dirty and not in the sexual way. You are wondering how to feel after seeing this 8 min. nugget. I was entertained but was disturbed at the same time. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. It simply starts. A young woman comes in for breakfast at her usual place. She sits down and someone starts singing. From there, the film takes you through so many different emotions at once, it's hard to describe. It's in black and white, but it helps with the feeling the movie gives you. This movie lets you know more about the characters, how they interacted earlier, and how the ending affected their lives afterwards. I guess as the old saying, "Let them want more", Nacho Vigalondo can do it. See it here when you can. Show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so fun without taking off your clothes.
