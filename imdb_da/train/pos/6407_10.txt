I went to this movie on a cast and crew show because my friend, who is a producer on the film invited me. Forget what you've seen in the advertisements, forget what you've heard, go see this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised at it. In the world of The Grinch, Charlie's Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, here is a movie worth your hard earned money! Delightful scenes, wonderful cinemtrophy and a throw you will eat with your heart. I found this to be one of those years most orchestrated power plant films and for some reason. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar node. If you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package, it would be the movie.
