King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and deeply moving film. Winner of 16 awards from all over the world, this movie is based on a true story centered on Wang Bianlian, a street performer in the 1930s China, who gets older but has no legacy to pass on his art of facial shift opera. He has a unique talent of rapidly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how to do it. He wants to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go to the streets and see that people sell their children because they can't afford to take care of them. Some beg for free daughters because daughters are not worth much in this community. Wang Bianlian's story continues from there. <br /> <br /> The movie was so amazingly good, the play was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. There is the gender difference and the depressing fact that no one in this time and place wants a little girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor, who always plays a woman and is known as Living Bodhisattva, is a man who dresses like a woman, and while he is famous and respected, he looks like something low and half woman. As we move into the film, the face stands out for people's slave trade and its demand, and hence the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the helpless and lacking power that any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents yet another beautiful achievement.
