It's a terrifyingly entertaining time interval in the 30's, it's a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", which only takes place on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes lace up liberal volumes of Gothic art nuveau that takes place in Batman for two decades. Contributing to Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly cast and the beautiful Pamela Hensley as the local Latina Mona, marking our hero on a gold shunt in the non-existent Latin American country Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, hold a fist to your chin, just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's ham and cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Expect a little "Raiders ..", a touch of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of battle and you just get it right. Beware of cult favor Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A leading candidate for DVD publishing, it's certainly too late. An inevitable treat for the whole family. 9.10
