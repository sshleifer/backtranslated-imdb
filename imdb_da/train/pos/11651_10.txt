When friendship injuries kill, it is in my opinion a very touching and kind heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to throw myself. It is a little difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. But I enjoyed watching them do things together and get presented by their parents. Before I unpack this, I would like to say, "If you ask me when Friendships really show you how it can be anorexic or bulimic, it can affect a person's body." Finally, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. You're in for some tears and a good time, so next time it's on TV, save back with a friend and watch it.
