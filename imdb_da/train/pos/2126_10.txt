Much about love and life can be learned from looking at the people in the shop around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another silent triumph added to his credit with this lovely movie. With sparkling dialogue (with his contemporary collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances by a cast talented artist, he created a truly memorable film. Always believe in playing up to his viewer's intelligence and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director counted on a scintillating cinematic repast spiced with the monstrous, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch. "<br /> <br /> Although History is set in Budapest (and there is a thrill of accents among the players), it has no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any large American city or small town can easily be locus for the action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan is wonderful as companions fall in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing your dialogue - so skillfully handled that they seem completely natural - convey their confusion and tranquil desperation when looking for sister girls, their is one of the classic love stories in the cinema, Cherubian Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, a man whose transitory significance in his small world is crushed when he finds himself a cuckold, an accomplished stage speaker, he allows no emotions to escape unexpectedly, and in addition, Morgan gives the film with his most joyful moments - almost at the end - when he finds out that his but iks latest employee, a poor youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another live image to his screen of screenshots, this time the one of a toadying sycophantic Lothario, which deserves the punishment eventually met for him. Gentle Felix Bressart has her finest movie role as a family man who really can't afford to get involved in the shop's intrigue, but remains a regular friend of Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden appreciates the small role of a sales consultant. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious honorary boy who exploits unexpected developments to harness himself to the sales force. In small roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Movie's stomach recognizes Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother and aunt.
