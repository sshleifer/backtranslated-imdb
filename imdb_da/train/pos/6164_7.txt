Do we really make 'video nasties' again? In the dam of a digital wide-screen large budget recovery of 8MM, it is quite a trip. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much history, and sometimes it becomes like a travel suggestion, as our heroine is looking at sleaze spots in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am pretty churlish for the "depraved scenes", including everything from hot wax, hard whipping and rough sex to drowning, cave and some. These scenes are immaculate and it is a shame that Bruno and his budget could not stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than just cartoons.
