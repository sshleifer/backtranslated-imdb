I'm not a very good writer, so I keep it short. World at War is the best WWII documentary I've seen. I've seen different WWII documentaries (not just English / North American), and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary I've seen. I think it could talk a little more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it does a very good job of covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair to everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish roles in different nations. It has a lot of original recordings, including color recordings and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70s when many more were living). It has good music and tells. All in all, I gave this 10/10 because it's so good. (I haven't seen specials in DVD version so I can't comment on them)
