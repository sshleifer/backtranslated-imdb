This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this. He shows his comic side and it was really weird to see him being turned up. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought the knot tie could be so deadly ?? Lots of great stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a fantastic final showdown! Do not touch Manchu thugs; they are ruthless!
