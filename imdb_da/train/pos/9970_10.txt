Brilliant use of exaggerated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element under the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarizes the behavior of the community looking through a telescope) is unique (and of course Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his movie "Pierrot le-fou"). Highly recommended!
