This movie has great plays, great photography and a very strong story that really makes you think about who you are, how to define yourself, how to fit in, whether you agree to play a role or break free. .. There are already good comments on these aspects. I would like to comment on the film's formal attitude. Basically there are two people on the roof. There is unity of place and time, with 2 main characters, and the radio works like the choir. Many directors have made Greek tragedies into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director has, in my opinion, succeeded as admirable as Ettore Scola approaches the purity and strength of the great Greek tragedies both in history and formal setting. A masterpiece.
