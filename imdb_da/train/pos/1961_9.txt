Just got back from the first view of Basic Instinct 2. I went into it and thought it would be crappy based on preview critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct, I think you will enjoy # 2 as much if not more. Fantastic story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is fantastic, reprising the original theme. Don't expect to expect Academy Award material, go to see it for pleasure and fun. That's what movies are designed for - escapism. I can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as she ever was. I'm thinking of seeing it again this weekend. Go see it!
