zero day is based on columbine high school massacres. And it's a video diary of two boys. At first you do not know what to do, you think it is just a poor student movie. until they start talking about the terrible things they have to do in this whole school. until they begin to talk about pipe bombs and weapons and to shoot in the woods. They are much to say about this movie. Everyone knows that this movie is a good movie, you forget to watch a movie and watch a real video two boys made. <br /> <br /> The two boys seem to be in a weird cult. They burn all that stuff. similar games station games books dvd's homework stuff school stuff. These two boys can be someone your friends, your brothers or the people you see walking down the street. It goes through daily activists (and it does a gun. In the videos they do it mentions bullying that happens to them, and how people said things about there clothes and the things you are in. I don't say the right thing, but many people do such things. <br /> <br /> And it is also because these people are suspected of suffering because of the sensitive issue they have chosen on this movie. <br /> <br / > So it's my zero day review. <br /> <br /> Let's just say the end shooter scene is messed up.
