ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I wouldn't judge it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on holiday in Hollywood, turning to a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) a fighting actress working as an extra at MGM. Although both guys are first attracted to Grayson, she votes for a preference for Joe, but Clarence later hangs with a waitress (Pamela Britton), whom he teaches, from his hometown of Brooklyn. The paper-thin plot allows for several good music tracks, including "We Hate to Leave," Joe and Clarence's Complaint about their fellow men as they leave the ship; Grayson's brutal reproduction of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of "I come in love for easy" (a song unfortunately deleted from some footage of this movie) and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame. Kelly also makes a kind of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet that rivals his Pirates Ball in the later THE PIRATE. Kelly is in top form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's incredibly shy character here is unimaginably sexy. An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory.
