Riding Giants is an incredible documentary that describes the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job taking the role of instructor and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. The film's structure is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the story, interviews, animation and surfing recordings. The music soundtrack just adds the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making the Riding Giant's brilliant display. Personal highlights include some of Greg Noll's comments, how about his straight-to-point frankness, Laird Hamilton's Teahupoo footage, and out-take at the end of the movie. But really this whole movie is a great, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to watch. It's a shame it's no longer known, but it's a gem that deserves attention. 10.10
