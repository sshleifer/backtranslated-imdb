I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it, but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little drum that was clearly inspired by musical / comedy interconnections of new or falling stars with musical groups of prominent. Kay Kyser's mysteries would be a good example. <br /> <br /> With Spike Jones released is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are part of the action, doing a good job support. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett's share rumor has what was offered to Lou Costello and thus Abbott and Costello replace the leaders. Don't know if it was right. <br /> <br /> All in all, a comfortable movie but important to have so much Spike Jones and his band on film for the story. Wish it was released as I haven't seen or heard about it in two decades. Hope it is not lost
