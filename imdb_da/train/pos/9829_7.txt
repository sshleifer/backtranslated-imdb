This movie is amazing on so many levels ... and none of them is the level it was supposed to be great at. Just remember this: When you see Shaun of the Dead and other Recent Zombie movies ... be the good or the bad ... THIS is the formula they use. THIS does what makes the zombie films so great. <br /> <br /> And what's better than big is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will give you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it won't last. There is never a point where you think of yourself "let me get on with it" ... it moves quickly and corners nicely. This is the sporty little Italian number of zombie flicks. <br /> <br /> So terrible it is wonderful! If your tongue spends a good time in your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> As a great trivia note: If you watch it on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects under the menu screen under musical score ... Well ... that's because the music was lifted right from the trailer ... which is probably the only working print of the music that still exists long enough to loop.
