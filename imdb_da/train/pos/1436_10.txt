Having worked in downtown Manhattan and often ate my lunch in the summer in the park near the town hall, I would see the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to walk over the doors to the town hall and see how it looked in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", "03, gave an excellent performance throughout the picture, and especially when he spoke to an African American Church for a little boy who was beaten. John Cusack (Vice Mayor Kevin Calhoun "Runaway Jury, 03, was a devotee serving to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to achieve. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great support role. But not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture! Great movies with great plays and great photography in NYC!
