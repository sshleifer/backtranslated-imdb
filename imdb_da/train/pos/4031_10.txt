I have been a Hindi movie buffer since the age of 4, but never in my life have I seen such a moving and affecting movie, especially as a Hindi movie. In recent years, I have stopped watching modern Hindi movies and returned to see the classics (Teesri Kasam, More Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only to move, but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me understand my own family history, which was always very abstract to me. But to "see" it, feel it and understand it, it helped me to sympathize with the generations ahead of me and the struggle that the Indians endured. The film helped put many things in perspective for me, especially considering the current world events. I never thought a movie could change the way I think like this before ... it did. The reason is great, the play excellent and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!
