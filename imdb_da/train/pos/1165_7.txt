As another IMDB reviewer has noticed, this movie starts a bit slowly, but gets significantly better as it goes on. Yes, it's released by Roger Corman, and yes it goes over some of the same thematic areas as much higher budget predecessors like FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of the wife's career as a rising blues singer to man's total loneliness and his almost freudian need to fill in the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while away with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is well done. By using a very small number of places and signs and also using water in almost every scene, both as a purifying and drowned metaphorical symbol throughout, this film, although clearly suffering from a small budget, will in many ways remind them of more fully realized and newer scenario, namely the French movie "swimming pool", as it seems to me at least possibly borrowed liberally some useful ideas from "OP MOD AMANDA." With a smaller tool set, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its excitement with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrender to the occasional lustful temptations, but achieves it as well or better as other films in this genre. The twist of the father's abuse of Amanda in the past (again, very freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic response to Amanda's situation, this aspect of history evokes. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
