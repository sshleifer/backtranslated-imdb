The memory of "The Last Hunt" is stuck to me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13. It's a movie that was far ahead of others at the time when it treated the treatment of natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant as in 1956, a biographical discussion of the greatest depth and relevance. On top of that, the setting is beautiful and the cinematography is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me until the end of my days.
