A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. To set the story of the famous Kelsbog, believed to have been of monks from the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of a young abbot apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the tall headless rider of pagan mythology. In the hope of regaining a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The film of true beauty lies in its' animation. Cell shaded in a bright and inspiring style with deep complexity that results in a look at, seems less simplicity. Derived much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series 'Samurai Jack' for its genius use of markup and background depth, The Secret of Kels creates a consistent affective Celtic world that lives under the shadow of Viking invasion. <br /> <The story may be intensely incorrect, and the life forms portrayed lack realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant as the film sits in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mystery. The forest girl is a wonderful addition and in my opinion the picture is what it is when she slips from branch to branch. Looks and disappears as a mysterious nymph with qualities similar to the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is an absolute treat. For all sexes of all ages it is a nice piece of family cinema. Don't expect to be horrible, but instead pleasantly impressed!
