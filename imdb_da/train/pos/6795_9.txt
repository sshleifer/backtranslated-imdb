One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative backdrop to the background and history of one of the most infamous serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be fascinated. Others would like to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, the Zodiac was not insane, but very methodical and self-promoting. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a "cold case" style thriller. It is an intelligent investigative / procedural-style horror movie that will put off gore dogs in search of cheap tensions. <br /> <br /> Some people don't like any movie shot on video. This attitude is very old-fashioned and provincial. It is an attitude and display of films that put technical issues over entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are coming out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low budget movie, no doubt, but dear viewers will look beyond it and find a carefully crafted gem.
