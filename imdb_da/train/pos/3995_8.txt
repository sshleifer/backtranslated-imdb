Kureishi has not exactly been blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Newly customized travesty is like 'Intimacy' has corrupted large font. But the mother surpasses all her previous incarnations and even darkens my beautiful laundry. A medieval woman overcomes the widow's hood by having a very sexual relationship with the love of her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe in all this is credit for the quality of the play as it is for the final gift of the script. And in Daniel Craig, we have a brash, brash, gruff anti-hero who refuses the audience to ever ask why a young stud would consider bedding for an anesthetic grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak depiction of peripheral figures, but as a study of unthinkable desire it is a winner.
