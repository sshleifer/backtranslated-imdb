First of all, I must say that I am Portuguese, and it is not usual for me to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably one every year or even no one ... <br /> <br /> ... and the reason is The almost generalized idea of ​​the Portuguese people that the national images are terrible, really close to the worst ever made! But in the last decade it comes as a surprise to me when we come back to the fun of the 40s, when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best of their time with films like "Pulsação Zero" or " Black Nula ", both from director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common. <br /> <br /> This one is also good, not the same kind, because it is not a true comedy; In fact, it is officially a drama, a woman's drama that has some unexpected fun parts, the cause of humorous characters or fun things that happen to them, like the hypothetical journey to the Caribbean just to be laid. <br /> <br /> The reason works and may surprise us a few times; the actors are fine, the rankings are regular as the score; But the truth is that it all makes sense, so we can count it as a good bet for the national cinema that seems to start from the ashes as the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Portuguese movie, you can probably choose better, but it's still one to be measured.
