I loved this movie from the opening sequence right up to the end. I found the director's / actor's style to direct me / the audience very engaging. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was to ignore - and thus challenging - gender and class stereotypes. The people's idiosyncrasies are portrayed as forces, and the absence of judgment - and the acceptance of the characters themselves and each other - allowed me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open up to new opportunities and offer hope for a world where people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
