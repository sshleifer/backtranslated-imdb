In August 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the subsequent trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child were confused by what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were pounding for blood. What followed was a gross abuse of justice. Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, Central Australia, a dingo had taken their ten-week-old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to dine in the barbecue area. No one believed in them. Lindy was accused of murdering her baby and Michael as an accessory after that fact. The whole country was afraid of the whisper of a ritual killer. Chamberlain's attempt was over before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never showed her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to judge her, but the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation ourselves sit in judgment? Where are we, how could we suppose to know? Unless there was absolute evidence and no reasonable doubt at all, comrades should have been acquitted. Fred Schepisi's films unequivocally and wholeheartedly support the argument of John Bryson's novel that the chambers were completely innocent of the charges against them. It was actually a dingo who took baby Azaria on the fateful night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, hell bent on the "truth" that was brought to light. He shows Australia in a rather carefree light as a people who were completely obsessed with watching the comrades pay! His play, co-written with Robert Caswell, greatly strengthens the emotions and will surely find the audience sad and angry at the justice that happened. <br /> <br /> The excellent Meryl Streep provides incredible performance as a woman accused of the most horrible actions. She brings to life the most convincing of the hard little Aussie who was ready to stand up for the claims and put the world straight. Even her accent is almost, but not quite spot on. A very good bet from the master of this trade. Sam Neill is as good as Streep as the first faithful, but then disillusioned Michael, who cannot understand why their world is falling apart and he begins to question his Christianity. His, as Streep is, is an expression of great emotional strength that will move you deeply. The whole support is also excellent, with some of Australia's finest actors and actresses playing a role. Technically, the film is also brilliant, with photographer Ian Baker capturing this great country with splendor (especially Cliff). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotional, while Bruce Smeaton gives a narrative result. <br /> <br /> For all Aussies, this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror, if you want, on what We as a country did to a family who just wanted to get justice and that truth was known . As Michael Chamberlain said, "I don't think anyone really understands what innocence means ... to innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Although he was entitled to return, Fred Schepisi's account of the justice prevailing in Chamberlains was baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, still emotionally strong and honestly moving. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Bryson's novel to the screen and simply explained the horrible story of a holiday that was terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain whose newborn daughter Azaria was taken off the family tent with a dingo right after immediate end. <br /> <br /> In the midst of speculation and vicious public rumors, Lindy was accused of murdering her baby, and Michael was accused as an accessory after that fact. What followed was a little more than attempting media, and with the Australian people she decided to be turned away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life prison with hard work, even though the prosecution could not show any motive and anything but circumstances . br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in the top form as the accused woman who fights Australia on her head to prove her innocence. She's really amazing and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, even though she does her best to sound ocher. You may be wondering why a top Australian actress was not cast into the role, but star power is probably the answer. Next to Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, excellent as the man who sees his world fall apart while he feels powerless to do something about it. A strong Aussie cast provides compelling support. <br /> <br /> Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Baker's filmography of rock and other rugged places is visually brilliant, and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for that. Really a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
