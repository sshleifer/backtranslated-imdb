Anyone who says pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is superlative. I even scold a tear when Celebei died. I DO NOT GROW VERY VERY! This movie is a moving animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth part of Pokemon, Ash and Friends have to stop the bad shake from making Celebei the ultimate evil weapon with its dark ball. In time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are constantly hunted by game hunters. I like the part with the double match, and Sam has the apricorn poker ball (if you have played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) I also enjoyed having miramax in charge of Warner Brothers. Placing mini-movies at the end was a good idea. The Pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever.
