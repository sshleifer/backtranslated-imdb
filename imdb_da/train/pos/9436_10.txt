"It's all up to you, Ed?" "Now you're going to play the game." The day my father left my mother, he took me to watch this movie with his new boyfriend, on the opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I wasn't even quite sure what I saw, but I'll never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> See it today, 36 years later, it still gives me strangles. <br /> <br /> My dad was a great Burt Reynolds fan, so why queue for almost an hour to see what would be an "action movie." I had seen two films on the Dome prior to this: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well it wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at that tender age, I appreciated the work of art ... and after seeing again today, I am surprised that I still stood watching this highly disturbing but extremely well-built movie . Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old who had not yet kissed his first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit too much for a child to witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it disturbing, but I'm still very impressed with the quality of the film production. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds is an absolute wonder, like all the principles ... from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar study, to Ronny Cox as the dreaded insurance salesman ... everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is unmatched, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. Photography, Filmography ... All the technical aspects of this remarkable movie are first-time. <br /> <br /> The moral issues raised from murdering the sexual assault to the pursuit of killing a human being remain as deep today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released . And the classic sequences of trying to survive in the desert after handling such unforeseen brutality change life. These four men, the city's men, were suddenly confronted with a situation that had never imagined raising the line from action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic to be sure of. And the term "you have a beautiful mouth" has been cited infinitely from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments about water cooler in the workplace, this movie is undoubtedly a big part of our societal pop culture ... as much as "Make me day "or" I'll be back "ever was. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you found your friends sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your city life, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the action, Burt Reynolds (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body under the soon-to-sea lake, or try and take your chances? Bottom line is: Delivery delivers. You can take it to the bank. If this film does not come under your skin, then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above questions. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed fails to kill the deer ... and then switch. Life and the unpredictable relationship can change a man. And I suppose that's what this movie is about Jon Voight, especially as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly understated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his play raises the film to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, scared and determined to do it right. It must be seen as being believed. I guarantee that your heart rate will be raised to a new level. <br /> <br /> Rapid paced, tense, tight and tightly drawn as a banana ring, this is a moral game that poses questions that remain today. Times have changed, but our choices as human beings have not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
