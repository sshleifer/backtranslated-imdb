Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it badly, I would refer them to Roger Ebert's review of this movie. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and he gave it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. A Chorus Line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway hope. I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. It's a wrong view. It's another story along with all the other stories being told about each of Broadway's hopes. What people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through. And I really think that is the meaning of the whole show. It is not just to emphasize the talent of these special dancers, but also to give us some interesting things to think about in life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star sees this movie with a good sense of relationship because they've gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic musical. It has its slow points, and at times it gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines, but all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Take a closer look at the movie, and you may understand what I'm talking about.
