A series of vignettes, most of them spoofing television from the 1970s, but also with some tombs on government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "Dealers," is not so much fun for me, and I don't know what it's parodying. However, some of the others are absolute side splitting. I especially enjoy the cooking segment. Most of the foul words I know are used in the movie, and if you protest against full frontal nudity, stay away.
