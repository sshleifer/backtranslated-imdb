Any film in Orson Welle's early days is a triumph all the way to the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a Touch of Evil. Please see them all! He tends to be pompous and self-serving in movies like F is for False, Really Stupid Waste Film. Don't waste your time watching it. It's really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon, and anyone studying movies should see everything he has filmed. All his leading ladies are huge, but in the end Welles became a full-bodied, like his character in The Touch of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I can see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, but I handed in. And because I'm a woman, I can see the attraction for him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers, and unless you count the film producers today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most movie producers must not measure up to the movie makers in the fifties! I know that there are many more good filmmakers today, but in such a short time I cannot name them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! 02/21/2006. Please remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I will not be stuck in the past! I love some of the movies now, but rarely is there anything I will put on a "100 best" list. "Hustle and Flow" was amazing, so was "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you," from a line in Sullivan's travels; another nice movie from the eighties! Can anyone give me a best list for the 90s and up to 2006? I want to know who to see! Thank you! Also props for this website! Where else can you join a movie or boo it! I love ranting and raving from ordinary people like me who can say what I want and I promise not to ruin any movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet!
