I recorded many years ago, but only came around to see it today. I've been sick so I had run out of things to see! I am so glad I saw it and I could delete my memory and see for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot about fried green tomatoes at Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said this is a kids movie. I disagree - it can be made by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I LOVED it! There were moments when my backpack stank. The story is unlike any other movie these days, full of adventure. I just ordered the book from Amazon, can't wait!
