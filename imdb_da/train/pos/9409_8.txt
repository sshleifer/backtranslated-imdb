A chemist develops a substance that never gets dirty or worn out, but is seen as a threat to survival of various industries. In this lovely Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is wonderful as the gentle but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with its sensual voice, plays the interest of love; Parker is her harried father. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch for the fabric industry. While telling an engaging story, the film also raises some exciting questions about science, economics and politics. It is skillfully directed by Mackendrick, who would continue to make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" later in the 1950s.
