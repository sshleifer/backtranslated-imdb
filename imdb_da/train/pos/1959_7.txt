Let me be upfront, I like pulp. But it's like one of those "light dives" that you see at the Olympics. It must be marked a little because it is easier to give a cheap excitement than to pull yourself into a world of, for example, a late medieval painter. <br /> <br /> This is just a two-hour ghost tour and while often (or more precisely, most of the time!) ridiculous and unlikely, it always goes ahead and it always entertaines. If not always in the right way. Take a closer look at the memorable quote section for a chuckle. (But why it's got a "worst movie" Razzie is enchanting - I bet there were a thousand worse movies made in 2006, but this movie was dealt with because it was considered a fashionable victim.) Main case and popular author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now over in London and writes a novel, but death and destruction follow her around as flies follow a horse in a place of hot weather. God heaven, she can't even visit the toilet without stumbling over at least two bodies and I'm sure if she opened the closet in her big penthouse flat, you would come out in great Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, clearly a very dangerous lady circling around (if you like your heart rate to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would someone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a killer? Likewise, her response to such accusations seems very relaxed. But is this just a personality disorder (a form of b / s risk management) or additional evidence for her sake? <br /> <br /> For reasons I cannot understand or explain that stones are assigned to psychologist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than taking the cells down after another "love found dead in mysterious circumstances". Fortunately (for Stone) he is far more crazier than any of his patients and has a restless home / work life by himself. In the blink of an eye, the ratio of the doctor to the patient changes, and then it is difficult to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur. <br /> <br /> In this hot mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh-sounding David Thewlis) who says that love hit the doctor - as a policeman for many years - that the lady in question can be dangerous. I mean, hold the cover. But glass is now too glassy to realize or care for. Like a dizzy boxer in front of a top-notch Mike Tyson, he matures for the big downturn, but not before Washburn may have a secret or two. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this movie) of someone who doesn't bark or otherwise murder. Provided she has actually seen the finished movie, she must look back with nostalgia as her underwear came out with Stone's lightness - fortunately (for us at least) these days are far away. Strangely, she doesn't think that Stone is as dangerous as everyone else - otherwise she doesn't think the script is good enough, or her control is big enough to do something properly. <br /> <br /> After several runs of the track mentioned above, a climax that blends provincial governments with a sounding hanger / twist that gives us enough elbow room for the Basic Instinct as dangerous as the rest of the movie 3 - Very unlikely at this time in time.
