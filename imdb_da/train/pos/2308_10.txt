I checked this out as an impulse when searching the movie store and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not the typical "chick-flick" with a sappy love story and tears throughout, but it certainly touches a nerve in the twist at the end. It is an end where the overall effect of the movie is not damaged by it, even if it is unexpected and tragic. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress, even in this movie, his debut and it is definitely worth seeing! I don't recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well. "The man in the moon" is such a credible story of a young teenager's infatuation for the first time. Most women can relate to everything - from the words of Witherspon, her subtle glances and her not so subtle feelings (races like the typical teenage girl). While playing a character confused by love, she doesn't come across as stupid and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today.
