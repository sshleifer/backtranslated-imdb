Although The Shining is over a quarter of a century, I challenge anyone not to be freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to tear it off; Instead, it has been referenced again and again in pop culture. The twins, the bloodlift, the RedRum, the crazy nonsense's "writing" ... this must be seen if you do not understand all the allusions to it in everyday life. The film is also frightening, exciting, beautiful and mentally exciting. It has Hitchcock's classic mystery and terror of a modern thriller. And that's what horror movies usually lack: a good script.
