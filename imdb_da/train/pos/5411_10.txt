I can't see the point by burying a movie like this in sulfuric acid carcass when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of products to ask for. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My kids sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute of it. Permitted, the villain is a little over the top with his stupid costume and maniacal laugher, but it is much easier to take than the dark, gloomy and very morbid Pokemon 3. My kids have seen Pokemon since it started and they will soon come to the eternities, where they will "discourage the childish things" and move on to others. I am pleased that we should enjoy this together.
