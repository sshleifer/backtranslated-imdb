If you played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, then you've seen it all. To really experience it, you need to get the DC version. You just have to say it's a very graphic superior game; The textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate and it has much better sound so it is PS cousin. I bought this game back at the end of the 00s and it still holds up to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a very superior and strategic game, but if you're a fan of 'Ol Web Head, then you owe it to yourself to choose this for your gaming library. Swinging around the city like Spidey has never seen this good and died in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, sneak it up for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
