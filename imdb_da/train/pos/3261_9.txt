Nay Sayers of this movie is probably bitter from some seriously unrequited love. This is a great movie for anyone who is able to understand Johnny Mathis song or a song from the era: Bobby Darins, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz's, The Girl From Ipanema, et al ... <br /> <br /> I measure movies by how many times I should see them before I am satisfied ... Chances are, I had some good times back. <br /> <br /> I also see the synergy between cast ... I thought they worked well together. <br /> <br /> Open your heart and let the movie's comic magic transport you. "Alan
