I totally disagree with the other comment about this movie. The visual effects complement the film's supernatural themes and do not detract from the plot, and I also loved how this movement was unlike Crouching Tiger, because this time the sword had no tighter, and most of you could see the action close. <br /> <br /> I think Western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes, one of which involves a monk trying to burn alive and the other about the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are derived from some interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism exists in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene is about an anniversary in the Japanese calendar ... people since then really believed that the world would come to a end ... Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to fascinate every viewer. I strongly believe that with some skilled editing it can be sold in the US. My only complaint is in the last match scene (I can't give anything away - sorry).
