Laputa: Castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as powerful as his recent works, and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates, how could it be better! The art is amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after that (I'm not sure if it was the first time I heard it) and evokes me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female leader in this movie is absolutely fantastic and the boy, Pazu is also a great role model - he lives alone! The reason is classic Miyazaki. I don't want to give it away, but the end is really good. I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three bests with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you might want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year I hope) If you like Miyazaki, check this out as it is available in the US. Enjoy, Piper A
