First I want to be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit over-the-top. A toned down perhaps less acrobatic scarecrow would have made this movie much less cheesy. But overall, I think it's one of the better B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely fantastic, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the important naked factor, there are several other films from which she can see her. But here she gets all the bad-hotness, especially towards the end, as she walks away from the engulfed bird scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a good job as a sheriff and as the drunk girlfriend. Yes it is a low budget B movie. But out of all those I've seen, this is definitely one of my most popular favorites.
