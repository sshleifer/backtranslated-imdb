This was Keaton's first move and is in fact three shorts set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman age, modern age) on the eternal triangle of romance. The stories are parallel to each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, as this was supposed to satirize. The strength of the jokes and gags are almost all dependent on anachronism, bringing modern business to old surroundings. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOW THAT ELABORATE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Use one turtle sum and wee-giving board (Stone Age); A watch with sun dial (Roman age); A wagon with a spare wheel (Roman age); Use of helmet as cover lock (Roman age); Early golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); Dictates a will carved into a stone (stone age); The changing weather forecast (Roman age); The wagon race in snow-buster using skis and huskies with an extra dog in the wagon's boot (Roman age). The above are all throw-away gags that keep us chuckling. However, there are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster takes out shaving equipment to match girl on make-up; The amazing dual time when an inbriated Buster stares at his plate to discover a crab staring at him (within a second he has jumped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and jumped back into the waiter's arms - one of the funniest moments I've ever seen). And the lion - the manicure - just brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also an off-color piece of racism when four African-American bearers leave their mistress for a Roman crap game. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate and film damage - probably at the ends of the wheel. The Metro function is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and full of laughs.
