This Filmfour-funded Sci-Fi movie is definitely a must see. While it requires great influence from The Manchurian Candidate and gives no new or original plot wise; It is handled with the utmost skill that it comes out as being fresh and inventive, although it is basically a reuse of a previous movie. It's good to know that movies are still being made like this (though they don't get big releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot turns around, giving it an element of paranoia and also serving to keep the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The ground follows Morgan Sullivan; a boring suburban man who decides to take a job with Digicorp involving him to listen to speeches from several competing companies and record them for reasons to him, unknown. But his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita ... This film contains a series of strong white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. This gives the film a very strange look that separates it from the majority of other films of the same type. It is only real related, that is Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The reason is also very effective and ditches nature development in favor of the more stylish - and more exciting - plot development. You never really know where you are with the plot, which serves to make it even more exciting. The play is pretty good with a largely unknown rejection of the team of stars; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam sees the part of the quiet and discouraging man in the center of the story and does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actress who has a CV that doesn't fit her talent perfectly, but she looks at her just for this movie. Cypher is far from perfect, as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it may be inconsistent; But overall, if you want an innovative Sci-Fi movie, Cypher is the way to go.
