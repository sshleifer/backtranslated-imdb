I claim no matter how hard I look, I never find a better movie version of "Othello". If you love Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpieces "Very Ado About Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), as much as I do, I'm sure you'll find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible too. Laurence Fishburne has had a number of fantastic roles during her career. He was absolutely fantastic in "Boys n the hood" (1991). I have always considered his entertaining role as Furious Styles as his very best achievement. It was, of course, way before I saw this. He plays Othello, and he is probably the most challenging role throughout his career, but he does a brilliant, great job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh are simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role in history's crooked, manipulating villain Iago. Marvelous "Othello" is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's ingenious works. It's about his favorite topics: bias, envy, fraud and jealousy. This movie adaptation is definitely one of the finest movies I've seen based on William Shakespeare's play.
