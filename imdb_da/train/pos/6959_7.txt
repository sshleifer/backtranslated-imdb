Well, it's an Ivan Reitman movie. with the rare exception Ivan loves to entertain. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me when I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just as big and I love her portraits. I also like Luke Wilson and Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot. Never take himself seriously, the movie is over the top and yet not very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before .... it's a nice rental and probably an OK date movie, especially if you have a headache and Don't want to brace your brain. It's escapist fun, and there's nothing wrong with it. When you remove "super girl" stuff, you are back with a story of relationships and relationships have gone bad. It's a boy who meets girl, boy leaves girl stuff. And in the end, the characters seek love. Not all of them are "dumped" as well as they could ... a piece of life with a twist.
