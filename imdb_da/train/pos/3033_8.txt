Good old black and white Graham Greene based people in dangerous times, doing heroic and mysterious things. Hardly a shot fired or a blow thrown and a hundred times more interesting than the glop being presented by Hollywood today. Bacall is of course on the screen and Boyer is completely engaging. They don't make movies like this anymore.
