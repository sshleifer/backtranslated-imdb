Suggesting Anton Newcombe from Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy to put it mildly. In You! who won the Grand Jury Prize in Sundance, we see him and his band self-sabotage over seven years, while former friends and contemporaries Dandy Warhols rise to comparative grandeur (a mobile ad, anyway). <br /> <br /> What raises you! Over its contemporaries is the immense, near-biblical comic-tragedy play: a depressing honest treatise on art versus trade and compromise. For all of his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius," Newcombe is actually revealed to be a uniquely gifted, if very troubled, musical - far more talented than his rival, Dandy's Courtney Taylor who tells the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor's Peter Fonda. Even more sad, Taylor seems to realize this, evinced by his tired, self-suffering voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but what cost? In fact, they were sold, made Indie-Lite records, kept their toes clean and clean and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus gaining record contracts and a large tour bus. And jettisoning all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in rubbish, is constantly busted, beats band members on stage, kicks hecklers in the head - and last glanced at you! Being away from the police has lost the right to see his child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about rock subculture have been directed by women: Penelope Spheeris has fallen into Western civilization and one ?? an instant classic the moment it was released.
