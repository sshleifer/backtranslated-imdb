The "But in White" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest, comedy movies I've ever seen! (and I so much!) It is about two garbagemen, who become "men in white" and then stop an invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says this movie is crazy has something wrong with their heads. There are lots of fun gags and jokes here and you can actually hurt your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly won't regret it!
