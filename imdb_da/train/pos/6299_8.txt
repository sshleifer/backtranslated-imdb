There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and the very first. This short caper does nothing more than what it gives to the audience. It presents a simple story, told very clearly with enough wisecracks to keep you going, so it just gets better and better. Clooney's cameo is fun and very welcome, but the leaders, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do it alone. Likeable and fun, hilarious so at the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
