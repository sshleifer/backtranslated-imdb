This is a great show and will make you cry. This group of people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again. Email me and let's chat. I've been to Australia and the real ones are talking like this. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and pass these amazing stories of real and wrong and friendship to your kids. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have collected over the last 5 years. See my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com and hear the expanded theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
