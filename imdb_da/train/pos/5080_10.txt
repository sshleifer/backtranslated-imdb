When ever produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet on your life if any of his images are seen for generation after generation. Just having Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", "47 shown and starring in the movie makes it even more of a great classic movie. In this movie Ellen Ewing gets married and then she meets all forms of mental problems and even murders Mysticism becomes very involved, and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", "65, comes to Ellen and sometimes you wonder that David is up and running. up. As you look at this picture, you are about to find yourself and begin to understand who is the right nutty person, and suddenly you begin to change how the movie will end. Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan who played a completely different role than he usually portrays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great Classic movie, with great classic actors!
