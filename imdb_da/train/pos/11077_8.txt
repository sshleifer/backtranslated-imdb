First of all, don't go in Revolver expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is another kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The second night I looked crazy, and this movie clearly split the audience. That's the kind of movie where half of the audience will leave thinking WHAT was it? It was terrible, and the other half would leave thinking WHAT was it? That was cool. Personally, I like movies that I don't understand, ie. Mullholland Drive, and Unusual Suspects, so I enjoyed the Revolver. <br /> <br /> It certainly wasn't perfect though. I saw the big twist come a mile away, at least part of it, and although some of the loose ends that are not explained are good, Revolver turns many questions inexplicably without any reason. Also some scenes, such as the animation and the scene, where Sorter goes on a killing spree (actually one of my favorites), although amazing scenes to see seemed to be there just because they were awesome to see, not because they fit in with the movie. <br /> <br /> But there were also many good things. I thought the play was great from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a pleasant surprise). This movie absolutely kept my interest, with a great, exciting, action-packed scene in succession. When Ray Liotta was kept under the table wow .... yes you have to see it. The writing was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as with most Guy Ritchie films, was amazing. Though one step below movies like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still a terrific fast paced, psychological, action movie, with many twists and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over.
