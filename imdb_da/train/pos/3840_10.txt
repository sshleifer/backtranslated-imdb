Jerome Crabbe starred in this movie. I watched this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired of it. This movie looks like Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the largest directors. I've seen all his movies all except Showgirls. My mother doesn't like him so much, but I disagree. I think all his movies are a trip to see especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, which include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still fun.
