Great Woody Allen? No. God Woody Allen? Definitely. I was with the audience who suffered hard and often on some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard for a while. The aging Allen created an appropriate role for himself as Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... kind of. Some have said that Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton." I ask to depart. She plays Woody's dialogue, which in her comedies always has a very similar feeling ... as well, a Woody Allen comedy. That's fine for us Woody appreciated. She certainly made Woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor tiring, but for those of us who love it when it's done right, we're looking forward to the next.
