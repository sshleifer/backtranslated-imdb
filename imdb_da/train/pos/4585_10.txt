This movie is Jackie's best. I still can't get enough of seeing some of his best stunts ever. I also like the bad guys in this movie (the old one looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some of Jackie's other works, this movie has also had a great story and I recommend it to all Jackie's fans.
