Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The 30s are a decade with lots of movies of every type I can imagine, especially in the early talkies phase. There were movies that are painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who just didn't give it a break, sometimes in a good way and sometimes not. This is one of those movies that doesn't stop for a moment, and it's both a wonder and a shame. Lloyd Bacon, who also instructed "42nd Street", must have been king of the Depression Era musicals, and he was probably thrilled with the possibilities that sound led to the cinema world because he filled this picture with it. There must not be a whole minute or two without music or any speaker. It's totally crazy! I thought the movie deserved a 5 (or a 6 tops) because the pacing was very poor, as it was crazy fast, and I didn't know what happened and what to think. The characters seemed to just run back and forth, talking about things that didn't interest me and probably no one else. I thought I'd just be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also threw the women's lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose end was the best part of it. And you know what? It happened the same with "Footlight Parade"! The end is amazing! It has become, hands down, the most impressive musical I've ever seen. The last party presents us some music tracks, and they are, believe me, something that makes seeing the rest of the film worthwhile. The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits and the most impressive one is certainly the other. Suddenly, the screen was filled with beautiful and inventive camera work, beautiful people, and pure entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
