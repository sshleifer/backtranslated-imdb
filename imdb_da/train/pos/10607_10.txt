Henry Thomas was "great". His character kept my attention. I was so "into" the story that I forgot it wasn't real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a particular person he was. The other people in history were important in makeup of his character. The way they banded together to help each other was truly awe inspiring. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit your head because you're not smart enough to find out for yourself.
