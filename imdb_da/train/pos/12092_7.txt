I remember first seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on sennat tv. Scared hell out of me. But then I was a teenager back in those days, not so sad about movies as I am now. <br /> <br /> The CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the Italian horror genre from the 60s, along with Mario Bavas BLACK SUNDAY (1960), THE COURSE OF LIVING DEATH (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a grim atmosphere along with good writing, check out these too. I also rate these along with the early Poe movies that Roger Corman did in the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD taken from a French print, which is a great improvement over the old pan and scan print that made the rounds of television over the years. It adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that doesn't really add much to the movie as a whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer anything extra besides still images from the movie. <br /> <br /> A flub I noticed was in the opening scene, as the smoke effects next to the camera were reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. I think the editors didn't catch it at that time, or maybe they didn't care, but that was something I didn't see for the first time. These are DVD's wonders. You will see all the flubber, bugs and details that were not clear the first time. But whatever. <br /> <br /> However, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
