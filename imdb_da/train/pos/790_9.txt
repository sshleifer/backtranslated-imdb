Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even though he is wearing his pants. <br /> <br /> The movie tore me in my heart and reminds me of the intensity of my great explosive love life. I don't think I can think of another movie, except maybe Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, who catch the horrible joy as well. <br /> <br /> The second drawing of the movie is the very English eccentric characters who enjoy the scandal vicariously. In that sense, it is very much the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery without chaos. This is a great antidote to the mock horror that is currently popular in the United States and any connection between people of different ages.
