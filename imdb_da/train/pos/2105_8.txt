Seen in the World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store consultant who is in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters to discover only that mystery woman is none other than the saleswoman from her store who seems to be constant bickering with the colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart has an affair with the owner's wife), Stewart briefly leaves 'fired' along with a concession that the saleswoman "liked" Stewart all the time, the happy finally is It is inevitable. Though VERY dated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - are spared along with the indication that many small items such as a musical cigar box are inaccessible to ordinary people's enjoyment), this movie is much more effective (and more credible) than in the 1990s again "You've Got Mail". In re-make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain of events are so incredible that the viewers intelligence is grossly offended. "Shop around the Corner" is an innocent stroll down the memorial path in a less complicated, less hectic and more romantic time and place known as a novelist Utopia. Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this image!
