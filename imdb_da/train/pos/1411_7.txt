Greetings again from the dark. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides an insight into some of the harshness of animals living in the desert. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom have given much of our insight into wildlife since our childhood ... back as there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Seeing the elephants trudge for days, almost scary from lack of water, is oh so painful. But their night game against the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater images are breathable. Mama and baby bows are beautiful and see the big white shark attack, its prey is as chilling as "jaws". The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen such detail about the extent of the area. <br /> <br /> Don't think most young kids today get too excited about this, but it's probably one of the most beautiful photographic documentaries I've ever seen.
