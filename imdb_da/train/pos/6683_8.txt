Forget the depth of meaning, let your logic be at the door, and take a good time with this maniacally fun, totally absurd, ultra-campy live action "cartoon". MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero girl you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied and beneficial that they are memorable characters in themselves. Dark humor, fairness, bona fide action and even a moving moment or two combine to make this imaginative fantasy of lovable losers a true winner. The dramatic talents of the actors playing Mystery Men - including a Mystery Woman - are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as it can only be described as a dealer cellar Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarre charming) villains who ever have to leave the sides of a dark horse cartoon and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
