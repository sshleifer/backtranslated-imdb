I read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have major problems in life. This show, in contrast to most game shows, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose glasses in everything he does, was again a hit on the show. He is really bubbly personality shining like a lighthouse where he even goes. He is fun and makes you smile and that is exactly what the show does. The dancers and questions, the round fashion they presented, only add to the show. And even though there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) found in most game shows is NOT available here. Several people who wrote messages complained about the amount of time spoken to the dancers and the choice of questions, and as if Millionaire did not have similar time requirements. All I can say is most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and good. There is something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye cakes (dancers), excitement, Mr. Shatner's wonderful fun-filled personality ... well, if it doesn't detect guys, I feel bad for you; And if that's not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. Out of ALL, the games that have ever been on and, to be honest, I HATE the game shows, this is what I really liked and really miss. The only other game show I ever liked was Match Game.
