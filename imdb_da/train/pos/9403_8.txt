"The Man in the White Suit" is another feather in the hat of the expert Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore!, Sweet Smell of Success). The movie star is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings its usual class to the movie, and makes it much more than a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy is not completely open. At the end of the picture, it becomes almost a complete drama. It's the kind of Ealing studio comedy that's meant to not produce laughter, but a sense of general entertainment, like the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the suit is not very original, but the way it is executed. The film is very original and recommended for any fan of Guiness or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
