The Irish and mortal essay Tony Arzenta (a divinely smooth and commanding performance of Alain Delon) wants to end the murder, but the dangerous mobsters he works for will not let him go. After his wife and child have been killed, Arzenta declares open season at all responsible for their deaths. Director Duccio Tessari tells the absorbing story at a constant creeping pace, maintains a serious and unwavering tone all the way through, staring at the shootings and thrilling car rides with great rip-snorting brio and setting the story in heady outbursts with explosive bloody violence. Delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already intricate procedures. This movie benefits from sterling acting by a bang-cast, with commendable contributions from Richard Conte as the wise mafia kingpin Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as Arzenta's supportive lady friend Sandra, Marc Porel as Arzenta's faithful friend Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as ruthless, calculating Capo Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Silvano Ippolit's smooth cabinet has several graceful pans. Gianni Ferrio's funky score hits the run-down groovy spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in nifty bit pieces. Even better, there is no filler to talk about and we even get a decent stupid tasty, female nudity. The eye-catching conclusion packs an average and lingering wall opening to the intestines. A solid and satisfying winner.
