So I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd pass half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to start. With a title I figured out, it was a lot of exploitation 'B' flic about inner bitch gangs. <br /> <br /> Much to my surprise, it didn't matter at all. Instead, it is a well-traded, well-written story of a young woman who almost accidentally enters female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his training sessions and becoming interested while observing his struggles. Since he does not really want to be a boxer (following only the father's wishes), she convinces her coach to take her instead of him. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as she goes through various attempts at her quest. To begin with, the brother's coach does not want to take on a female boxer. Having done it bravely, there are problems in reconciling her struggles. Then the confrontation with his father when he finds out what's going on. Yes, a love interest develops, but it serves to improve the plot that comes across more interesting inter-human reactions with its own struggle-related consequences. All in all, it is a good little sleeping movie that few seem to have heard of. Some time later, when I saw the much-announced and acknowledged "Million Dollar Baby", I thought "wait a moment, it seems to be known". Needless to say, I didn't see "Hart's War" that night.
