Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual card not because of the subject (adultery) or because it's animated (Winsor McCay had introduced Little Nemo to movies at this time), but because it shows errors to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz had originally wanted to film the actual bugs struggles, but could not get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered so he died and began using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction. This short does a good job of putting human characteristics on small creatures like riding motorcycles, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also do Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this. If you are interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, check your local library to borrow DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and other amazing stories from Image Entertainment.
