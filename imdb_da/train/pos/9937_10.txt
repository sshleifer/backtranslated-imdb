This television series was one of those I loved when I was a kid. Although I now see it through the pink shady glasses of nostalgia, I can still say it was a quality program, very educational but still fun. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish one. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the show was to show you how the body works. I swear that the school still hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show. It is also bound in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do not train with fine examples in the body. Who wants another bar of chocolate when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? : D The comic book looked lovely, very child-friendly of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon characters that look pretty much like how to expect to look like in the animated body. This and the Story of History (especially the environmentally scary finale) were important parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.
