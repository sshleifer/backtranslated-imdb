This scary and straightforward gory adaptation of Stephen King's great novel contains excellent key performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really gruesome gore effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style, and manages to make this one of the few versions of the King's work that is not only worth seeing but really oblivious to. The exhibition of the zombie child Gage (Miko Hughes-later in "New Nightmare") is as remarkable as it could easily have been a ridiculous character made threatening and spooky.As for the people, who think this is not scary - see it alone in the dark (ultimately with your squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you "Pet Sematary" will crawl you out. Some horror movies like this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be seen in the group. Recommended for horror fans!
