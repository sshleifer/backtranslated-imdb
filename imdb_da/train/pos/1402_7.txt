Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest movie that Paul Verhoeven, director of amazing movies like "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" ever made. <br /> <br /> That's not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with a completely mediocre script, and he made the best of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with many cynical jokes, amazing special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film becomes flat in the second part, where it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or perhaps a very bad "Alien" clone. The end is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, which Kevin Bacon holds back to life after a series of events that should (logically) have killed him. </ SPOILER>. And everything is quite superficial, and it has never been fully investigated. The subject of being invisible is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, Verhoeven manages to stay well above the average with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of **** stars
