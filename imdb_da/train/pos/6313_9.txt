Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in the prison of a perfect heist.Since he is behind bars and cannot do it himself, he must leave it to his girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). There are five guys who organize the crime - five guys with very little brain capacity. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It is a crime comedy that is often very fun. You can't help laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys. There are some good actors playing these characters. William H.Macy plays Riley. Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil. Gabriel Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Peros love interest Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair. This is a very entertaining flick. I definitely recommend it.
