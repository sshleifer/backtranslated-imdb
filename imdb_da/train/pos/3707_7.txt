I found myself at six and seven while watching this one. Altman's touch with zooms in and out was there, and I expected these devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they were sometimes free, sometimes witty, often infertile so as not to point out anything ironic or any other connection. Especially confused two zoom-outs from the gilded dome of the savannah. To be fair, a few zooms (outs and ins) increased Branagh's character's increasing confusion, a la Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow's. On the whole, the zoom moments were good, inconsistent and sometimes even trite. Other Almanesque units, such as multiple camera-subject glass panes, succeeded in suggesting the characters' diphtheria or narcissism or opaque sciences. Car windshields, house windows and other screens were used efficiently and fairly consistently, I felt, harking back to the PLAYER and even LONG GOODBYE. A few captivating cuts, especially for a suggestive TV commercial, reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, for sardine effect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mismatch between Altman's very personal style and the great emphasis of the Grisham genre momentum, failed to excite me. The director's 1970 masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classical genres, including the chandler detective film, as it looked in some ways; this time, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic stranglehold to get a meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre. Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, maybe? Or am I missing something because of my weak knowledge of the genre he takes on here? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the casting was excellent everywhere: Tom Berenger (for his frightening desires), Branagh for his (deflated) Hubris, Robert Downey Jr's pheromonal drop, Robert Duval's waste method and Davidtz's lurking femme death were almost perfect choice all. And with the exception of a couple slipping out of Georgia in Chicago on that part of (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, accents were convincingly southern. Suspense and mood were exciting, though the story was not nineteen viewers. The moods of a barometric coastline in coastal elevations were exquisite, carefully reproduced - I felt like shouting at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto. <br /> <br /> Finally, the tower I judged 7. <br /> <br />
