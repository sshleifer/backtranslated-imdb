Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the goodie baddie roles they held in "All the Brethren were bold". Taylor seems a little uncomfortable in his evil guy, but Granger plays his role perfectly. But the real hero of history is bison and northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. The direction is tight, and although the film is not luminous entertainment, it is for my way of thinking about a big movie, unwarranted by cognoscent.
