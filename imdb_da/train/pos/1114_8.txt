At that time, I remember being terrified of this movie. I referred to it as the main movie I had seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually inventive behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter young personality that we all had into a corrosive, adult world view. The two together provide an amazing blend that can be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Hope. I wish you weren't my brother so I could **** you!) Bernhard's looking for himself after returning to LA from New York, results in the immersive trial of different personas (like everyone Fits badly for our entertainment, but enough of them involve acting to appeal to a "black imperative" value system, the real barometer of her adaptation is whether black culture accepts her. (It has been a while. Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has an impressive solid-built black lover in the movie) A beautiful black girl joins the show and seems to approve of Sandra's faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her . <br /> <br /> Just as the Catholics consider themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, Sandra shows herself suffering in the hands of a black culture where she wants a place; as if she appreciates her dignity and her rejection. It is the only value system implicated in the film world outside of Bernhard's arty confusion. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main issue is racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the two topics being dealt with in an atypical way.
