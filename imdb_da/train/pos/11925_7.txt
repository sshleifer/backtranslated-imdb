I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon. I have to admit that I have never been a great baseball fan, but I can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie. What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system. However, as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad in the mental health and fetal system of society, it was quite refreshing to see a movie showing both ups and downs in this system: people who jumped from family to family , biological parents do not always take active involvement and transitions that can be but heartbreaking and heart melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are anchors of this film and both bring very believable beliefs. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself throwing a tear at the end of the movie.
