This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The end of the movie makes me endure every time. If you want to watch a good movie then it is. Jimmy Stewert delivers a wonderful witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spell binding. Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is fantastic comic relief and delivers some of the film's main lines and performances. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance like Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop employee whose life's ambition is to please those he works with. It's a simple story of where close colleagues can stay and how two people who have great enmity against each other fall in love even though exceptional circumstances.
