This was the beginning of it all! Granted, this is not friends at best, but this was the show's pilot, let's not forget and not bad at it. We are introduced to the band and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship coming over the next ten years when Ross says, "I just want to get married again" and Rachel storms with a wedding dress on ... probably not deliberately as at the time when the authors were heading for a Monica-Joey relationship, but are fit now when they look back. Something else. In this episode, Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before, but in later episodes the so-called flashbacks are contradicted as the two have met three previous occasions. Nevertheless, the point is a good start to a good show. This episode may not be the usual friend, as we are used to them, with the casting still a little inexperienced, but in the next few episodes we see why the show became what it was! Watch out, first season is a blast !!
