This excellent drama had me excited all the time. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second because every word kept the connection to this confusing murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really cried in the end (which I won't give away!) It also makes me realize how horrible and morbid people can be when it comes to being murdered. <br /> <br /> Casting was also very good. The only bad cast member was the actor who played Anne Marie. The actor did a good job, but the director did not. I say this because he found someone who did not see a single bit as Anne Marie Fahey herself.
