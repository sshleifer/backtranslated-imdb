Where SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is underutilized in what constitutes more of a supporting role, while the spotlight goes to Andrews. He plays a hard-hardened politician who is used to handling a bunch of thugs in too heavy a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in arresting him. When the suspicion falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he goes along with the investigation of the murder, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the cabbies daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she plays here and does not seem to fit in with the clear background elements of history. The story takes a grim tour as the investigation goes deeper, and it has been discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. In the end, it becomes a moral narrative with Andrews, who develops a conscience over his crime. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating as a film noir with skillful performances from a heavily offensive body. A good entry into the noir area, heavily directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight miscasting of her character.
