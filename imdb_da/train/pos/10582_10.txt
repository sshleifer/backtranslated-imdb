It sings. It has drama. It has comedy. It has a story. It's one of the biggest movies ever made ... period. If you can't enjoy this movie then you should be asleep or in some kind of mental disarray. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and dances his way to an Oscar; but in this movie he is better! This is James Cagney at his quisessential BEST! He's quick with one-liners! He is quick with his feet! It's non-stop action. And the song-and-dance sketches are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil." And the offensive throw is great; And the whole movie is optimistic, fast moving and radiates confidence. And even though this film was made 70 years ago, it is still observable, even today. And of course, this movie has Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She's the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and also Dick Powell! If you like upbeat, fast movies, lots of song and dance, it's the movie to watch.
