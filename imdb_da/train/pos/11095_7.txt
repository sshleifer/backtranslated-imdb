I always wanted this John Frankenheimer movie. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason for this was not just another thriller because of Frankenheimer. His tight direction and attention to small details make all the difference, he even hired a porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that is the last good movie Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor only gave a great performance. Clarence Williams III got all publicity with his frightening performance, and he is also excellent, but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this movie as others, but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porn actors appear in dull parts. What can you say about a movie that has Ann Margaret shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a really sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploiting thriller that should not be forgotten.
