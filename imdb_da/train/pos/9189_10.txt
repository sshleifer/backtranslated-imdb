Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 am, P.M. one night I could not fall asleep until noon. 3:00 <br /> <br /> This brief review may include spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of The Sopranos and I can say for a long time that this is the best episode I have seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family and looked at my own father, joined the ICU before he left. <br /> <br /> The section begins with Tony in an alternative reality: he is a seller who is the identity has been wrong for a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> When 10 minutes had passed, I knew Tony was dreaming or I saw another show. It wasn't like the normal soprano and I loved it. Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks at the sky on a "helicopter spotlight" and we see prodding through it, a flashlight doctor. We only see this for a moment, and the sequence goes out until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I have just said. Tony has come out of a coma in a moment. His boys take A.J. at home and Carmella, overcome by stress, breaks down the hallway: A signature moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we cut into the real world: The family deals with the potential negative result of this coma, and Toni's alternative reality, which parallels what is happening both in his mind and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star's point in the episode: after AJ stops telling her mother, he has flunked school, she goes in to see Meadow sitting by Anthony's side. <br /> <br /> She approaches Tony and broadcasts the best line in the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and lights a light. He takes the shoes out and goes to the phone. He tries to call, but he can't - as if trying to say something back to Carmella, but couldn't physically bring himself to do so. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out the window. A shining light that has reoccurred through the episode now seems to call him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold, I'd like to die" by Moby marrying these last pictures perfectly and helping to create an emotional roller coaster of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: See the next episode. You find out what the light is. It is wonderful.
