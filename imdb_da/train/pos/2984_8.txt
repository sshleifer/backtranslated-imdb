David Zucker has directed one of the most fun comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and depends on a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently fun as opposed to some recent comic stakes. The movie is filled with all sorts of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more entertaining kind that you need to be aware of everything in the frame or you will probably miss them. Like his previous efforts, which include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor goes out almost every second. There are so many moments working, it is easy to overlook the few who fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have relied on making fun of many famous scenes in almost random movies (take "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with similar characters. It touches on sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry rather than shining on specific movies. Even for people who do not care about "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker create a couple of leading natural chemistry actors. The movie also makes extremely effective use of cameos by athletes, sports professionals and other celebrities, especially a fun piece with Robert Stack or "Unolved Mysteries." By the way, keep up the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has, in words that may apply to the movie's blend of sports, a home dunk.
