I remember Parker Posey at "As The World Turns" before she became the queen of the independent films. In this movie, Posey shows his potential as a leading actress. In this film with supportive cast that includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel vendor on the street who strives to become a teacher. The support aid has a wonderful actress who plays his godmother and only family family such as Judy, the librarian, old-fashioned, dedicated and menopausal. Posey as Mary learns to grow up and mature. Losing her librarian position makes her aware of how much she misses it as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village in New York City before it was gentrified with yuppies. This movie is quite good for an independent and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters in other films.
