Every child has the movie he enters into VHS when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around. This was the movie for me. I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least and I can say it's a good child / family movie. <Br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I haven't seen it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week and be a child for the day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love the caregivers and their messege. <br /> <br />
