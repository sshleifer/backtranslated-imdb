To my surprise, I totally enjoy 'Spacecamp', I remember seeing it 13 years ago, and recently I rented it again. I was totally impressed. Of course, the special effects of today's space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are much better than those in SpaceCamp. But this movie had a story - a very stereotypical four-story story where you could almost recite the next dialogue line before hearing it. But that was what I liked about it - they don't make movies like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add fabric to the light and fluffy plot. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, it was very sweet, but unfortunately it had more feelings than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
