Certainly one of the French films of the decade, a tense atmospheric thriller that fully exploits the leading signs that hinder the use of sound in a way rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos provides a truly stunning, multi-faceted performance, sometimes rude and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offers from France.
