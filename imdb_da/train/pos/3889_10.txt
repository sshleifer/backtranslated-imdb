Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comic genius, and this is Eddie at her very best. His material is extremely witty and fun, and his delivery is some of the best ever witness on the scene. Instead of insulting the public's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs one cannot help but repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every fan of top notch standup comedy will see "Dress to Kill". By far, the best British standup comedian I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard has fought for success outside the live scene. But his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he really is. "Dress to kill" is a treasure, one that has happily found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed over and over again.
