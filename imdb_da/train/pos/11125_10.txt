What can you possibly say about a show of this size? The "Soprano" has literally redefined TV as we know it. It has broken all rules and set new standards for television expertise. Everything is flawless, to write, control and for me, most of all, the actor. By seeing this show you find yourself realizing that these signs are NOT genuine. The action tricks to think that there is a real Tony Sopran or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't look at the show because it's violent, it's not just about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you see as a fan. For me, I do not like when people refer to the show, a show about the mafia. For me, it's a family show. A family that has been separated from the mob for generations. All in all, this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from amazing actors, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines expertise and dares to be different.
