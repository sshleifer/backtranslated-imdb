I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depression era musicals will be much more relevant in the next few years. Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you lived under a rock) and sometimes look gloomy. But we always have the movies as a way to escape our problems. In the 30s, the film movie was hugely popular, even at the height of financial gloom. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was such a film that the audience flocked to. While this Lloyd Bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)" does, it's still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three centerpiece Busby Berkely's extraordinary tracks, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her bottling is so-so, but Busby's magical "City A Waterfall" whispers her and what seems to be a hundred other corpses into a dizzying water park. Of course, Busby's numbers could never really be performed at a stage (they speak gravity for one thing) and they violently contrast with the realism of the hard, wisecracking non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his too few musicals (really, what couldn't this man do?). He even gets to take over from the leading man, not the sailing cloth and the fawn over the sex pot Shanghai Lil (there is really little Ruby in China girl wig!). He co-stars with Joan Blondell, his adorable adoring secretary, whom Cagney somehow overlook in favor of other women (until the final wheel it is). Blondell was apparently the only other woman Cagney loved except his wife. And you can see the mutual worship in each scene.
