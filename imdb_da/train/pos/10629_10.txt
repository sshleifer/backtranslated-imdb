Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a frying pan. . . If you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror movie genre and you have a special place in your heart for that twisted, this is the movie for you. An incredibly well-developed first film, "Hatred of a Minute", has all the draw of mainstream hits such as "Silence of the Lambs" and of cult classics such as "Army of Darkness." Editing and effects are well done, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment that draws on both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when a large budget lacks big movie names much in the way of substance, the independent film has revived this dying feature. If you love Michigan, go for a good story, or a decent thriller, look at "Hat one minute."
