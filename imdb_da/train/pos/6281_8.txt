I've had the chance to watch more movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This movie remains the wonderful action and great story. Even if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture, it is not. Not having this movie on DVD helped make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent play that doesn't always go together. Overall, this is what makes this a great fun movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you get either two things. An image that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a film with grainy HD image. I was disappointed when I made this for my first blu ray movie. I almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard. Although I look better after watching other movies. I don't think they spent as much time as they should have transferred this movie to hd. It's generally the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray Discs, you should only have the best picture. So I only consider this a valuable investment for people who have never seen the movie or have not purchased the DVD version.
