I showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I loved it too. The history of the termites and their interaction with their surroundings is amazing. The casting of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is really classic footage. Alan Root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary Oscar. The copy I have has not Orson Welles told it (Derek Jacobi), and it's not called "Mysterious Castles Castles", just "Castles Castles." This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added to the star force and an Oscar push. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to find this VHS just recently and it is now my children's favorite movie. They brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're really lucky.
