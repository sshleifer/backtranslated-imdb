I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone behind sulky reminds me of my father, who was drawn to trotters because unlike full-blooded jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 home of Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a completely different movie. April Love is easy and easy to see, a good movie. (Disappointing, though Pat Boone's religious / moral view forbade him never kissing the girl! Totally a change from today's standard ticket.) Home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white with no suggestion that anyone will ever break into song) captures stress and struggle better, thereby making the ultimate performance more satisfactory, but it requires a greater emotional investment.
