This movie is light, fun and beautifully recorded. The light is amazing, and the colors convincingly convince Vermeer paintings. <br /> <br /> This is sentimental comedy in its best way over American and French standards, and no doubt better than English too. <br /> <br /> Each character touches and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is amazing, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in his odd role, and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie, so give it a try and add your own review.
