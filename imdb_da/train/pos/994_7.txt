I once saw this movie and could see it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I feel they could have used a "less fun" character like Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes, for example, in prison when confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too fun. David Morse is again a wonderful portrayal of a policeman. His hard but mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up getting hard on Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this scenario in every movie. I personally love the quality of a movie where the actors end up in the same situation as a previous movie that these two made in The Green Mile. All in all it was a really good movie.
