De Sica becomes one of my favorite directors, but one was a hit-and-miss for me. A laughing idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and triggered police forces, but slowly evolving into a magic fantasy profession, which the boy is wondering about Toto developing unlimited superhero powers. I had this with the always smiling Toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, I got back in the dust. There were so many wonderful orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers that I continued to believe it was a waste that the film was not more serious with its material. The link of neo-realism and imagination is more like an experiment from the "look-what-we-can-do-do-mum" variety than a fully developed piece of work / art.
