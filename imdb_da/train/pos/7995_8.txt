Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story with a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He is three personalities here: a down-and-out-key-now-drunk mercenary, then a loving father-type person for a little girl and then a brutal madman on the ransom seeking answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington being employed as a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He gets attached to the child who is playing winning by the child actress in our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the responsible men and saves no one. Beware: this movie is not too squeamish. <br /> <br /> This is stylish film making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their taste, as the camera work is one that could give you headaches. I thought it suited the tense story and was fascinating to see, but it's (the shaken camera) not for every taste. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low key role and a number of other fine actors. <br /> <br /> The film pans against the basic feelings of all of us, but it works.
