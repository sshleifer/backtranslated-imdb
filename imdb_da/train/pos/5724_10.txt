Massive more chills down the back! I'm surprised there are people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10 am and still got scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! To cry aloud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, OK, voting, not very good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the true look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the beginning, you hit again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorizing scenes! So many cliches don't dodge to surprise / scare! You know, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Take a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and don't see it at night! Hats off to Japanese!
