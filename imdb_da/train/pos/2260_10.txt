A DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One who is seriously undervalued. The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg performs well here, but the best performance in the entire movie is the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in several movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.
