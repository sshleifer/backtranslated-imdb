Some movies manage to survive almost on originality alone - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those movies. Scripture manages to throw everything in a close height, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller cannot be chosen to cover a weak manuscript, but rather to reflect on the drug-related reality. As director James Cox as a very peculiar way of working on his actors. Most of the characters are persistent on the edge, and often because they are rather rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a hustler who is able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes only seems to be able to control the drastically weak mind. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic achievement. Comparing this with Kilmer's more 'Hollywood' roles as in "The Saint" it seems that he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks. The actors are the greatest force that holds together. There are various small ideas that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all amazing. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a strange, amazing energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I initially watched "Wonderland" because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actress, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story is about John Holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murder mystery, and as such - it's great. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
