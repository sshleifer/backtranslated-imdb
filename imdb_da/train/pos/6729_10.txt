If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or are interested in seeing the real, non-caricature "Real American" side of America, then Riding Giant's frame will be deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal", a facial period if ever there was one but very appropriate if you can derive any kind of literal meaning from it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but With all the drama of an opera, and the utterly sense of love, expert and knowledgeable initiated by Stacy Peralta's direction and narrative, this movie guides you from swell to great wave, keeping you completely excited about everything you get the privilege to see. <br /> <br /> This film is a symphony, designed as well as Beethoven's 9th, which begins beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii, deepens human emotions in Santa Cruz and ends with rebellion, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamilton's feats again. in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classical music; Like Beethoven's 9th Ride by Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, it may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
