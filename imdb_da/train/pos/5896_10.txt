A really good movie and true story. Dan Jansen the greatest skater ever. A touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansen's fight with cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. Of an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister, Jane was right to believe his talent in speed skating was justified. This picture is well worth the time. I want them to make more films of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and a great story. It is a very touching story of a beautiful family support and belief in their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister.
