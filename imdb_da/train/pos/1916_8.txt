"8 SINGLE PROVISIONS ... FOR DATING MY TENAGE DAUGHTER," is my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. But I think it was always fun when an accident occurred. I've always laughed at it. Although James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me, his sudden transient was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. Eventually I hope some network brings it back to the air for fans of the show to watch.
