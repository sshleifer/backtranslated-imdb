I thought the Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without children, I still enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I've seen for some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really humorous, and I didn't think his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I've watched the movie at least 15 times (I own it of course) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to find out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... "Pack of wolves, pack of bears, flea package, package of whiskers, nose pack, pack a bowel, pack lies, pack of problems, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or even the part goes! It's the funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humor behind "putting lazy on the map" and many other parts too. The only animated movie that can be compared externally with the Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
