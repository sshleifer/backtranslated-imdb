I loved this episode. It's so good that all 5 of them stop and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guest stars in it !!! I just hope Clark will join the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes all over the world !! =) It was really exciting and keeps the viewers interested because of what will happen next time. I think Chloe should also join the team as the Watchtower, it would be such a cold thing for her to do beyond the Daily Planet because she doesn't have superpowers. I will also find out what types of topics Lex should use for 33.1, I wonder what other forms of power other people in the world have !!!
