These guys are anything but the usual suspects! They are a total bunch of odds that you will see get away with it, but they are so rude that there is very little chance of it. Nobody is better than William H Macy portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck. This is probably his best performance since Fargo. The same rockwell played the meathead boxer perfectly and the rest of the band was uniformly good. Luis Guzman brought a great comic relief like Cosimo, and George Clooney stole all scenes in his cameo role. The heist scene at the end was absolutely fun. <br /> <br /> The direction was also the place of the Russo brothers. There was probably a Coen brothers feel to the film all the way through and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers. They have a long way to go to match Coen's but this is an excellent start and I am looking forward to their next celluloid excursion. ....... "Yo Mutha is a whore"!
