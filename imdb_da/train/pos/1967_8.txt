I don't understand why the reviews of this movie are so universally bad unless I'm right at my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You won't get deeper into a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this one. It has teams within layers, nuanced plays by Stone, and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People have to come across that Sharon Stone is 48 and that Michael Douglas is not in this. I predict that this movie will be a big hit on DVD when people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the bad professional reviewers. Give it a shot, you can be glad you did it!
