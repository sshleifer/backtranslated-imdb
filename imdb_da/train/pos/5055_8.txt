I don't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story was on its way, unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced movie. I was surprised and pleased with this (basic) true story. Made me like to read more about this fascinating character, which means the director fulfilled his purpose and the movie was a success!
