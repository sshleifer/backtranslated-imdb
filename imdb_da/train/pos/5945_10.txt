Let me do one thing clear. Mostly, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood is sincere, fair in general and even more specifically related to the treatment of much-loved, iconic characters from the pages of comics. Why? Well, let's take a typical Hollywood board meeting scenario to illustrate should we? .. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Hi there are lots of dollars to be picked up from superhero flicks these days.' <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 'Good point, let's do a hurry! ?? We make a lucky dip in a hat and choose a super hero randomly to base a movie on! '(Dipping takes place and a famous superhero's name is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1' Great! Now who can we play that part? <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 "Who is a big office star at the moment?" <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 '* The name of the great actor * is the thing this week.' <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 "But does he really fit the role? I think he doesn't look like the character at all. '<br /> <br /> Executive # 1' Who cares? He is a big name; We will still make the movie with him. "<br /> <br /> Executive # 2" You're right! And besides, we fill the whole movie so fun with great special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever ask questions about it! <br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one reason why I generally loath most modern superhero movie. All style, no fabric and simply pathetic casting of the iconic wires. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood gets it right ?? take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. But back to the general negative features that Hollywood presents today? .. wouldn't it be great if our study leaders were always choosing actors who actually fit the roles? Well in this less-than-ideal world, a filmmaker thinks just about it or not by casting actors based on their true resemblance to their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately, Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to control a full-length movie, but fortunately for us, he has given us exciting glimpses of what the final result is likely to look like two (not yet) famous superhero short features. One is the amazing Batman: Dead End, and the other is this mock trailer for a totally fictional movie called the Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not pick our words here? These are amazing things! <br /> <br /> The cast of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn (who looked so great, but totally wasted in the noisy barbarians), makes the most perfect choice for playing the iconic steel man. In fact, with regard to physical equality, it has undoubtedly never become a closer approximation to the comic. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his amazing depiction as Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, another huge bad piece of casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If only this was a real movie in full length! Hollywood study leader? take note! That's how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I am once again fascinated by the very fragmented reactions that this short film has caused by fans. It goes without saying that the most acute and violent side effects against it are clearly coming back (as with Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less cinematic audience; a fact let down by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal use of basic diction. Such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is actually a sad phenomenon, though one that our aforementioned Hollywood Head of Studies will undoubtedly receive great satisfaction from. After all, these very same misunderstood people are most likely the same kind of CGI-dependent popcorn stuffing imbeciles that discover in most crap that Hollywood is fighting out of the rivers these days.
