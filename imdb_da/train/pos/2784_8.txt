Nagra comes from conservative Indian family who are not just into girls playing competitive football. But our attractive young star can play some serious football. Rhys-Meyers coach Nagra and encourages her to perform while Knightley is a supportive teammate and friend. When sis' wedding is scheduled the same day as the ultimate football game, what is a girl doing? Similar in its own unique way to BFGW, as Nagra is trying to push the envelope onto traditional family girl. Here is the father (well played by Kher) who can see both sides of the problem. Docked a whole point for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis, if they needed filler, they could have gone elsewhere. Nice final wrap up to the whole deal.
