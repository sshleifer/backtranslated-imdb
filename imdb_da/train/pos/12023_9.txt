A shift in outlook is needed to enjoy modern British films, one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than the criteria that American films are judged. Britfilm has to try to be gritty and find it hard to do it, but in British British movies it can master their otherwise overwhelming competitor. This movie does not fail in the content, but only by attaching itself to its predecessor, making it easy to see as the star and instructor work somewhere near the end of their toes. It's a couple of decades later, Gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind. He teaches the school's railings against human rights violations. When students are fired, they find abuse in their midst, he must look at whether he is just talking. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive movie because there is not the usual worldly character of an American movie that you expect to do whatever he does, but a naive man boy who might still put everything in line principles. Maybe. It's certainly no protest-for-speech, even if it's too hot. Where American films may seem realistic because they are urban and gritty, these and other British films from recent years - those who are not trying to match America for visceral excitement - are real because British humor reveals truths.
