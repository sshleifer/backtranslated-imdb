Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, I have a lot of nostalgia to watch it on video tapes. At 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the leading players' future career. Although Sinatra had made a few insignificant short films shortly after his appearance after his Dorsey days as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this almost seems to be a warm-up to On the Town. Sinatra may have worked hard on it, but his dance with Kelly is credible and he would do better in their next pairings. But observing his physics makes it easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academic prize to act and continue to play many roles as a hard detective or leader in battle. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated this movie, his immense performance does not suggest he would become a great creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style complementary to Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh face of Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later force a "thrill" killer, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder of the 1920s. An added note: A reviewer praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was highlighted in this movie.
