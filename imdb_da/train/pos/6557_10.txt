I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoy the movie. The film is original, witty, fast and completely charming. The reason was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the throw was fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, filmography, editing and management were excellent. All in all, I thought it was an absolutely enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult men) reluctantly attacked the film. Apparently, they oppose films depicting strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend it to all children and parents.
