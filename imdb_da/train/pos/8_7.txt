Very good drama, although it seemed to have a few blank areas that left viewers filling the action for themselves. I can imagine that life is so for a person who cannot read or write. This movie simply crept from the real world: The wife who is suddenly the only supporter, the living relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child being beaten and then typically falling out of school, a jackass man taking the nest eggs and buy beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
