This film is a gem because it moves with soft but solid solution. I warn viewers that even though it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms. Liu is there, it moves at an adequate yet sedate pace. It is not about explosions, car crashes or flying bullets. You must be patient and instead note the details here. It's reassured because that's what the protagonist is. The viewer must see him and think when this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give spoilers - because it destroys the point to see. The reason is what you've read from the other posts: an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure, sign for a corporate spy job. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside the data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This movie begins in a surreal way - with a background song for business disillusionment that unites with the distinctive underlying paranoia. <br /> <br /> It begins to accelerate. <br /> <br /> The action on all parts is amazing - and yes, some of the actions are caricature characters. But they all fit together and they entertain. And the candlelight space in the background is just perfect as the soft, soft key-synthesized theme: Everything is not right at first. And at the end: Everything is not what it seems. <Br /> <br /> Get it comfortable and turn the lights down to see this - and turn the sound on: This movie wants you to listen.
