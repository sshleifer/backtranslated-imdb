I would surely like to see a resurrection of an up-dated Seahunt series with the technology they have today that would bring the baby's excitement back in me. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke, where my heroes were every week. You have my vote for a comeback of a new hunt. We need a change in the pace of television and this would work for a world of underwater adventure. That way, thank you for an outlet like this to see many views on TV and many movies. So any way I think I have what I want to say. Would it be great to read some more pluses about sea hunting. If my rhyme would be 10 lines you would let me send, or let me be in doubt and make me quit, if so then I have to go so let's do it.
