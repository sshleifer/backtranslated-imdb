"The Shooter" was another type of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is usually associated with action flicks that include martial arts, this film, because it was a western one, made him show that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula stories have allowed. <br /> <br /> The big problem, of course, is that the movie doesn't allow any solid character development. The meat is really back to the viewer. We can only guess the sadness that has created Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer he is - a killer, think of you, that a small town terrorized by a local bully welcomes a hero that can release it from its misery.
