This movie uses great movies, the depth of the camera captures every character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put amazing performances, though Washington's accent dies in some scenes. How is this movie forgotten? unable to rent or rent in recent times, it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. Attenborough at its best since Ghandi stands this masterpiece for what it takes in movies like these, not worrying about getting the audience rather a cry for freedom in SOuth African Apartheid. Though criticized for the biased nature, the film is true to the book of Donald Woods and belief in the message intended to express to the world. take and peace
