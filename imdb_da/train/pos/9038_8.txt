I loved October Sky. What I loved most was the music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits perfectly into the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't just enjoy the music, I also enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise to me. He gave a first class performance, like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie escape the life that's already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
