This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon of many horror movie fans after directing the seminal and infamous cannibal holocaust. But do not expect to find any such infamy in this movie as it turns out to be incredibly tame in comparison and play more like a Conan inspired outing to a young audience. Such a description can instantly dismiss most fans of the entire Conan-inspired Sword & Sorcery genre, but before turning your nose on this, it must be said this movie is just so fun! It is mostly played for laughs and has two GREAT and extremely sympathetic heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the barbarian brothers, who both seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie favorite Richard Lynch emerges as the biggest villain in the play and it's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ladies are amazing to watch and barely fit throughout the film's duration (a staple and very welcome ingredient in the genre!) What can I say - this is simply a really fun and restart resume the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly!
