A meteor drops from the sky and recovers a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake. As the monkey eats the locals, they try to get away from killing the monster. Recent attempts to send old horror and science fiction films such as Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are a kind of reproduced moot when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the kind of movie that these movies spoof and send up only this is the right deal. Its all, the movies are trying to be only without the tongue in the cheek and it's so much more fun because of it. This is a real drive-in kind of movie that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mixture of stop motion and a life size, is a charming quaint little animal. The filmmakers pamper the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Sure it's totally fake, but not movies about suspension of disbelief? In fact, I think really cool monsters like this have. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low budget drive in a way. If you want a really authentic drive in monster movies you no longer look. This would be perfect for a double or triple function with similar seaming films (Boggy Creek, etc.)
