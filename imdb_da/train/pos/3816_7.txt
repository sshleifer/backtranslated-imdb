"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the protagonist's experiences interact with them in the wake of a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widow single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there and she feels that she must make a new start in life in a new place. She does not respond well to the violation of local Christian zealots, one of whom is trying to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people away as politely as she can. In fact, she just brushes about everyone in Milyang to begin with, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade their world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman starring (Jeon Do-Yeon) is unreliable. After reading that she won the best actress award in Cannes in 2007, I was expecting her a decent job. But Mrs Jeon is captivating, and it is impossible to take her eyes off when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of annoying Evelyn Waugh-esquire work that shows how fate can feel insane as much as weirdly inevitable.
