"A shot, a killer, no exceptions." One has to see if you are in marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Great overall story, great camera work, good drama, action, details and much more. Close to the real thing. But it's not a movie to break down and select the editing errors. This is to sit back and have a good 99 minutes. The reason has a depth, but this film is not entirely about getting you thinking. It's about enjoying the sniper's lifestyle and action. snipers 2 and 3 are pretty good follow-ups, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a good job with his character and shows the hidden side of the sniper's life. the plain to handle all death. Must watch for sniper fans.
