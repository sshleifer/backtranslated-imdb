I do not want to spoil the contents of anyone who has not yet seen this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> A world famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers who have followed genius in silence slowly tempted him to share his greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each actor to play their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Don't love the relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present-day history, their needs, their skeletons, desires, and more. I should not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose drama is played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain associated with their own disability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is really tested here in a very difficult setup in one of the films that either end up as disastrous or amazing. And fantastic it was from start to finish, not a second less or more than enough, you are left with a sense of change and a taste for more. <br /> <br /> To this day, definitely one of the best movies I've had the pleasure to see.
