I will not drill everyone by repeating what has already been said, but it is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is out on DVD !!!! I hurried down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderful dark and spooky character, and all actors were very good. It's a shame that the network didn't continue. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to see it when it was on TV (she is 20), gets very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I can't wait to see the episodes that weren't sent. <br /> <br /> This show rocks !!!!
