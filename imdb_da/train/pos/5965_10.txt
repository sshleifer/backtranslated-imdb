I gave this a 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child in the 80s and quite heavy metal for many years. That's why I like this movie so much. It is so cool to see these posters in this boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collection (revealing the evil of Exciter, Rise of the mutants of shock metal master Impaler and Kill is my business at Megadeth). Also the soundtrack of FASTWAY is incredible and fits well with the plot. If you are in metal then TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Don't buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and the story take you back to the honor of the 80s. You will not be the same person after.
