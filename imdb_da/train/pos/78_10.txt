Although it has one of the standards "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has the quality that is lacking in as many horror movie characters as you like. When you see it, you feel for him you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him when he goes for revenge, even if he scares you a little with his original rage. As the film continues, his character becomes tragic. He has committed his murder, but now he has to kill to cover it. And again to cover one up. And again ... your belly drops with its soul as it goes down into its spiral - just like seeing a beloved brother turn into a hood. Although the revenge story is old, the plot units themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. A shame this is not available for home waving.
