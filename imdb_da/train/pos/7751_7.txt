I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. Just let it get over you and enjoy it while it lasts and don't expect anything. It's like sitting on a cafe terrace with a beer, in the summer sun and watching people pass by. It certainly won't keep you in mind afterwards, it's true, but it's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just the experience of the movie that's great. I felt that there were a few threads that could have been made a little more, but being a Lynch fan, I don't care much more :) <br /> <br /> And I loved the * style or flair of this movie. It's smooth but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will get his kick out of AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I give it 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (music 10 out of 10)
