The Home Room really surprised me. Compared to other films written about Columbine High School, this one is the best. The home does not show school shooting, but rather the aftermath and impact of society and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters. Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who experienced the whole shot. She seems to have no feelings about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna in the hospital to be able to leave. Meanwhile, police are investigating Alecia as she might know that the shooting was going to happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not go together first. Eventually, they develop a mutual understanding of each other and become friends. (very much like the breakfast club). Home Room Displays beautiful closeness and turmoil after a school recording. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
