Verhoeven's film was complete and complete waste. He is a scary hack of an instructor and should be ashamed. By his own recording, he read 2 chapters in the book, bored and decided to do it all from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would never have supported that garbage if he had lived to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks the policy in the book (which is a good deal of it) and throws in some T&A, so the average idiot American movie gamer is not bored. <br /> <br /> This anime isn't perfect, but at least it's mostly correct, which I can best tell.
