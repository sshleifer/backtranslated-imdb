So often a band comes together to a reunion concert only to find out that they just can't get it together. Not so here. This concert is just sharp shine from start to finish. Of course, these three musicians got together in advance and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy others' ego. This is obvious from the start before they even go on stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys first performed. From the first song they capture the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton said at his own admission that he had to go to this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc. So we should see him as well as possible. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as a kind of drum guru. Jack Bruce just wonderful. They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the time test for many years to come. This is a 10 for me.
