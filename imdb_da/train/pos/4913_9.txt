The title exceeds the content of this movie somewhat, which can lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly, there is very little "panic in the streets" that is seen here. In fact, there are actually very few people in the film who actually know that there is a killer on the loose who might spread the plague to everyone he meets. When we have said this, we have a very well-finished story here with a voltage level that nevertheless starts quite high (because unlike the people "in the streets" the viewer knows what is happening) and the director Elia Kazan is building very consciously. As the pest infested murderer was sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found out was the developmental relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). In the beginning, the two really do not like each other, even though they have to work together. Eventually they have forged a true bond of respect for each other. Kazan did well. <br /> <br /> Almost all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was taken with a very early look at Jack Palance to play what would be his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came as a bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not entirely central to history. All in all, an excellent job. 9.10
