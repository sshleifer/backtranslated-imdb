Really enjoyed this little movie. It's a moving movie about fighting, victims and especially the friendships between different peoples (the child's actor playing Miki is especially good). There are so many great impersonal films around WW2 that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm and an original one in it. I would also add that this movie is far from boring, very far !! Of course, the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. For anyone who really treats their animals as part of the family (I do), you will find this movie particularly rewarding. Recommended for movie fans seeking something a little different.
