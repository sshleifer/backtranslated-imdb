This movie is really special. It's a very beautiful movie. Starting with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, they are poor children living in the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag of money, and then they could continue to buy a house and their lives seem to be much better. They make new friends, life women. But something went wrong and they become enemies and it all ends up killing each other. I was negative about this movie at first, for when singers (Gackt - Solo, ex-singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese songs) trying to become actors, but it's not like the other singers -movies. They do a good job and without previous experience in film (except Lee-Hom, who had been in two movies before). This is definitely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but - it was this movie that made me discover him. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the protagonist - the orphaned Sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script and it was he who insisted that Hyde be playing Sho's friend, vampire Kei. At that time, they didn't know each other, at least not as friends. But after the movie they became really good friends, and it also shows us that they have really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation. The film has many different feelings that run through history, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. Then people die, Kei leaves, and everything changes so much. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends so sad but still beautiful. So if you haven't seen this movie, you really should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
