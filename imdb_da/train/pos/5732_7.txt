Since September last year, I've borrowed four to six movies each week from the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (HWL is really a circulating library: three-quarters of its films are out of time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find The Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, when I knew a little about the animated series, I downloaded Dumbland. I'm here to report that for David Lynch fans, the eight episodes see half an hour in use. <br /> <br /> The most notable feature of these short pieces is their soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Creepy voices accent breaks' ends. Physical violence provides beats. Chirping birds and buzzing sugar brush along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The pacing of the raw animation often keeps in sync with the sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's primary interest in creating and conveying this work. In a way, these eight shorts are unique Lynch rhythms. That said, the situations are odd, ugly, deep, stupid, and funny as hell. And there is enough room in them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be. I can't say I want to see the collection again, but for anyone who is rugged in the movements of the Suite Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
