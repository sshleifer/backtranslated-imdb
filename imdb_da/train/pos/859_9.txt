It is so rare to find a movie that gives a plot that cannot be figured out at every turn. Surprises throughout the whole joy throughout. A few things I could not quite understand is that here you have the leading female character playing "the good girl, hard worker", but eventually she ends up being an anti-social risk taker. It wasn't enough that I didn't like it, but it gave me a break. The other thing I couldn't get was the old man who was removed by the police at the end of the movie. I never got who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has ideas, I'd like to hear what they might be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and fun all the way through and always makes me guess. Worth to see.
