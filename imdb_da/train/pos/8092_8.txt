I happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was outside playing all day, freezing, and when I came in around 4pm, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that wasn't all happy and stupid - and was actually dark and moralistic. It caught my imagination. I'm sure it lacks the text and is shortened in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice to bear a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfishness, rash decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaint. But the only place where this movie clearly rises over the new movies is the voice characterization. John Hurt is fantastic in this. If you don't like how the character is drawn, look away and just listen to him. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it again many, many times, and it always brings me back to the time, as a child, thirsty for some magical adventure. That's why I'm saying 'lucky', the movie is nostalgic for me, so I overlook its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's imagination, it still reached me and still does.
