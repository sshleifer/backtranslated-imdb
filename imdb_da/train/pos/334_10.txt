It is very easy to qualify the movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This statement is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they appear to be citizens of that era, 1100 B.C. They personalize the characters perfectly. Another reason is that the poetry, which Homere expresses in his poem, is well given by the production. Among other things, the stories from the choir tell a special atmosphere that makes us a feast in the artistic reproduction. Third reason: The reconstruction of the decor is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean, where the poem's action took place. And most of all, the feeling is rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
