Okay, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has a great story and plot and amazing actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hot and he is perfect for the role! He's gunna being great in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead! This show can last a long time because I really love this show and I hope it has great success! It's so interesting. I've been waiting to get out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great! I lose it too. I can see it when I want now! Too bad it is only once a week. I wish it was at least twice a week because now I wish it was Tuesday every day! Hope you all like this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
