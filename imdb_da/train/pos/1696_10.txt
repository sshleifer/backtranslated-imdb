This is cool stuff. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very fun and very dry. I've seen this movement dozens of times and have yet to enjoy it. The actors are funny and it gets better with every view! If you need "Morons from out of Space" you will love this. A great game on World of War. I love Red-Neck rampage to get foreigners, bug on the hood, DOD, Heat Seeking Populous Annihilator, Mine Field, Red Camo, break the speed limit with 1800Mph! "I get the shovel!" Very funny. I would love for this to get out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews see it for yourself!
