The story of the first aired television rate of "Columbo" is simple: half of successful mystery writing teams get away with each other, hitting an invisible Mafia group, being blackmailed by an admirer, distancing with the admirer, and pulled up by stalwart Columbo. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is still one of the most entertaining in the history of the show, which greatly benefits from the work of late Jack Cassidy and the star Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Besides the remark of being directed by a young Steven Spielberg, the episode also has an air of macabre because of the future of two of its stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. The two share several scenes together and it is exciting that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming, Cassidy on an occasional fire and Colby in the hands of the attackers, but to be found after three decades. <br /> <br /> Now both departures are true-life MYSTERIES!
