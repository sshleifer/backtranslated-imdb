My mother took me to watch this movie when it came out around Christmas 1976. I loved it then and I love it now. I know everyone has fun with Barbra's hair in this one, but I think she looks and sounds good! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed looking at the time! The bathing stage between Streisand and Kristoferson is equally as sexy! The music is also good. These are the best 70's Babs at her best!
