I have a lot of time for all the Columbo movies, but this one was extremely well written and the solution at the end was very effective. But my main memory is the opening of a scene in the middle of the movie, between Columbo and the killer (I apologize if I haven't remembered all the details about that precisely). It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: The view is from inside the darkness of the closet where the victim was murdered, and into the room outside, which is lit by daylight. Columbo sits in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway (and us) and contemplates the closet and almost in the silhouette due to the contrast of light. There is no sound. The camera moves slowly out of space and up towards him. He is deep in meditation, gently pushing on a cigar, swirls of smoke from the cigar slowly circulating upward, as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts. Superb.
