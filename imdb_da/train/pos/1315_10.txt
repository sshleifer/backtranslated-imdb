I've watched this movie more than once on television. I ALWAYS see it again ... NEVER turn the channel. This movie is filled with chilling surprises, and sadly your seat exciting, without being overbearing or stupid. Helen Hunt's talent is magnificent shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone !!!
