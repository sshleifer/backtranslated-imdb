After a bike ride that day lying next to a lake in a nature reserve where half an hour fed and talked to a donkey who lived in a beautiful area with a small tree in it, this movie made absolutely sense to me. br /> <br /> The film's imagery was beautiful, and that's all you need. Turn off the conscious control button in the mind and work. <br /> <br /> Reminded me of Baraka (1992) but with the added lesson in my previous section. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines are at least not 9 lines, but ten. When you finish counting all the lines, you realize that there are less than ten, although less than ten lines are all that is needed to make my comment.
