The first and only time I saw the woman in black I was the only time I knew it appeared on television back in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I saw it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in village church. I was quite young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more horrific to walk through the cemetery to the entrance to the church that evening me or my father !. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this movie that make it so scary, but I think they are not much in the way of a soundtrack that plays in the background of almost every Hollywood movie so every knob, dunk and bang is more reinforced in your head as there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories is that there is no jumping factor involved as things jumping into the closet, so it doesn't necessarily make you see, but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a wise medium, as nothing scares you more than your own mind that runs riot thinking what is around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> An amazing ghost story, I've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over again on TV I can't believe the BBC has deleted it after (in my knowledge) only one view!
