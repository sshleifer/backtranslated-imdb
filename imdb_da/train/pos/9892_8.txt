This movie is such a cheesy goodness. <br /> <br /> A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start to get knocked off, they know they are stalked, so what do they do? A girl decides to take a bath, someone else decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old girlfriend so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go on it. <br /> <br /> And it comes through with Gore and T & A. <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the ordinary 80's slasher is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people, or as Hollywood sees the rest of the country, this has a unique perspective. This is a Brit movie made to be an American slasher. It is fun to see how often the British actors trying to speak "Americans" accidentally slip back into their British accents. <br /> <br /> If you like cheesy 80's slashes (like slices) then you will like this.
