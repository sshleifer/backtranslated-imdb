This is the most compelling and outstanding achievement that Robert Taylor has ever given. It even surpasses his amazing performance as "Johnny Eager", which comes 14 years after that film. His appearance is still a wonder to see, but he has a maturity that now gives him the edge in this cruel, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for the money, but for the pleasure. His wild eye killing of not only buffalo but humans, is great to see. He is basically a lonely man who needs the people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopath behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is sadly hunting, and only goes together because he's a failure on something else. Along the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her too. Granger is a little sorry to see, so tired of the hunt and longing to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunk rails is wonderful with his clever cracks and accordian games. Russ Tamblyn plays the half race trying to fit in a white world. The group is a strange mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor is spooked by buffalo, which many hunters had before him, and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon returning, Sandy leaves the female evening with the woman and puts Charlie on a giant of killing in an attempt to get Sandy and get the girl to herself. The final confrontation comes in a blizzard, and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's film all the way, and he was really a very underrated actor in the era.
