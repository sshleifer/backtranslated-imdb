Culled from Chuck Connor's and Steve Brodie's real life in the 1890s New York, "The Bowery" is high energy and good natured. But be warned: Casual race epithets flow away from Wallace Beys and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot can be spectacular. This applies to the time it was set and the time it was made. And it also speaks to the diversity of the population in the forest's throat. It certainly complements the grand taste of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is the thunderous thunder in the center of the action, a high-heeled saloon with its own fire department. And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper. Raft like Brodie's Connor's slicker, better-looking rival in almost every endeavor. Brodie could never turn a trip and loved the attention, which led to a jump out of the Brooklyn Bridge (it's still debating whether he actually jumped or used a dummy). <br /> <br /> Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on Irish-American accent. He's just the gruff kind of character to draw kids, cats and ladies in need. This is possibly the most offensive character ever raft ever played, and he even gets to throw some dancing (as well as a show of legs). And again he fails the leading lady (lovely Fay Wray) to a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as any of them, even though he gets the chance to turn the tears on. The highlight is not the leap from the bridge, but an unobstructed fistfight between Connors and Brodie that closely resembles a real resistance between those responsible. It is certain that someone has been broken more than an ego.
