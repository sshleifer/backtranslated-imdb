This is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shots on video crinkliness. It takes a little time to warm up to it. The action is so bad that it soon gets a zen-like charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or repeated sounds of some supplies. The characters all develop a quirky charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I would hire to play a ravaging psychopath. He just seems to enjoy it so much! Blended into the scenes of crazy and zombie attacks, some really visually effective shots of the title character are "Midnight Skater" zooming through the campus in a black hoodie and looking for the whole world as a cross between Grim Reaper and himself, The Silver Surfer. These shots sometimes make the ridiculous things that the characters say about the skater, almost working. The soundtrack has some very fun Garage-Punk tunes, and the raspy, raucous meanness of it fits well into the movie's mood. Thumb's upish, I say.
