In microphones, the stooges are best there. In this brief, the trio is the handyman who works in a recording studio. They end up looking at Alice Van Doren (Christine McIntyre), who sings the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Curled in a row is heard by Mrs Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls the curly Senior Cucaracha. The three stooges end up celebrating where Curly should dress in a row. They play a record of spring's voices, and everything goes well until Moe destroys the plate on Curly's head. They end up using lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs it. Alice Van Doren catches on the boy screaming and hiding behind a curtain to help them out. Everything is good until the baritone wonders how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph, Alice discovers behind the curtain. The three stooges are revealed as fraud, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. Stooge is pelted out of the room. Excellent.
