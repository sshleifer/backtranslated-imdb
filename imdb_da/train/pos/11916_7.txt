With all the "grown ups" in today's family movie, it is great to see one where you don't have to worry about it and just sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, this movie can have some difficult words (this is the time when Knox swears, but they don't let you hear the full words), but for the most part, this movie is really as clean as they come (and it's also movies from back in the day). Not only that, it's very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a nice clean and fun movie to watch with the family. The only thing I have over this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any spoilers here . <br /> <br /> All in all, nicely finished and a great movie to watch; So go out and have the kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!
