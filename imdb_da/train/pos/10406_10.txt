Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD helps King Ahmed recover his kingdom from an evil wizard. <br /> <br /> When Europe went to war and large parts of the world flared, Sir Alexander Corda's London movie revealed this lavish escapist fare from the Arabian legends. Forged with swords and witchcraft, the audience in 1940 gave a short deadline from the headlines. It is also a fine piece of film making that contains good actors and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it and plays the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with his piercing eyes makes it possible to remember the macabre roles he played with such joy in quiet days. Here is a villain worth looking at. Like the boyish thief, Sabu is completely cast in this, his third movie. Though it is not quite in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed and action. The rest of the throw works fine. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as the uninformed king who must learn about the reality of living in the hard way; Sabu gets a significant portion of the action (when he's not converted into a dog), but Justin is appropriately athletic when needed. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. The huge Rex Ingram shakes too late in the movie, like a genius with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to the great advantage of the storyteller. Miles Malleson has another eccentric role as the childish sultan of Basra, always dithering on his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's play and dialogue). Always Morton Selten portrays the benevolent king of the legend. Mary Morris, who later plays an extraordinary actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-piece Silver Dancer. The film was started in the UK, but war problems made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction in living Technicolor is most attractive, especially the fairytale architecture of blues, whites and pinks. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> Born in Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in Maharaja in Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's firm and sat in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After renowned military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but he was infinitely limited for years by playing ethnic roles in undisputed smaller films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) is the only major exception. His final film, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years old.
