Like The Jefferson's, Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms that were never sent in Britain, not to mention it came out in the 1970s - a decade of which I was not yet born. <br /> <br /> But like most fans of the show, I watched a few episodes on You Tube and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is led by James and Florida - two parents are trying to make ends meet and who, despite their lack of skills, encourage their children to have their own desires in life to fulfill them and take their chances. James was the strict but loving father who did not dare hesitate to discipline J.J. Michael and Thelma if they were to cross the line. While Florida, on the other hand, was a fair, kind and considerate mother and loving wife, although in many ways she resembled James, in terms of their attitudes toward parents and family values ​​from an African-American perspective. <br /> <br /> The kids were as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humor who would often wear multi-colored clothing and whose "DY-NO-MITE" catchphrase is as contagious and known as Arnold Jackson's 'Whatchoo Speaks' 'about Willis?' from Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was a smart alec who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Her verbal talk with JJ was mostly hilarious, as was the love relationship between brother and sister, which was played extremely well by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> During the season there were a few cameo appearances made, especially from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself! I really prefer Good Times to say The Cosby Show, which was an 80's show because a) I preferred Evan's family over Huxtables both in a) characterization and b) as I felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues, a way that resonates with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary aimed at highlighting the life of the working class, African Americans in the 1970s America. Cosby Show tried to accommodate the general public in a "candy coated" way when Huxtables was portrayed as black who easily assimilated to an upper class American culture, we would associate whites with, while Good Times, in contrast, was much more "edgier" and it was not afraid to deal with themes such as substance abuse and child abuse in a realistic way. In fact, I found out that while The Cosby Show can be fun to watch at times, it lacked the little sassiness that Good Times has, and made it more trendy and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show jumped shark in the last seasons as it continued after John Amos character, James died in a freak accident (in fact, it was known at the time John had interrupted good times for good. And then his character's death was written as it is on the show). Without John suffering the show, and unfortunately it lost a lot of its charm. <br /> <br /> Yet, for a sitcom, Good Times crossed all the right boxes. If they only showed it in Britain in the 80s. As it certainly is, as JJ would say, 'YOU-NO-MYTH!' <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
