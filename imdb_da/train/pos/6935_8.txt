James Stewart stars in a classic western revenge story associated with the fate of the movie, other star Winchester Rifle. Stewart, of course, is excellent to add a little cold hard-bodied to his usual laid back cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of players, pistol fighters, Indian merchants and bank robbers as we follow the riffle path through Indian battles, bank supports, etc. The support aids are all solid with Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean, -wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger. Also as a trivia note a very early look from Rock Hudson as an Indian chef. <br /> <br /> End showdown is a classic, tense rifle battle fought on a long row in and around a rock tree. Throw in some good old western actions, fist battles, shootouts and horseback chases that make for a quiet western adventure. 8.10
