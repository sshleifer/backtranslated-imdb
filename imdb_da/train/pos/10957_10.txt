This show will probably not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants, she doesn't ask for permission, and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. Star on the show is not a hero, she is a pampered, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the upbeat humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn, Comedy of Comedy, Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and Rob Schrab's and Dan Harmon's creative energies (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House) . It also shows the best talents in the budding online community, channel101.com. (If you are in this show, watch out for "Institute of Acceptable Media" at VH1 in March, it must be drawn from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> See Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
