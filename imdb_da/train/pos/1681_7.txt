"Scorpion tail" has all the elements needed to make an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) gathers a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow leads to Greece for payout, but a number of horrible murders follow her. There are many suspects, including a resident investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer is trying to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your vice is a closed room and only I have the key" and "Who saw her die?") Is a fantastic heroine. It's one of Martino's best movies.
