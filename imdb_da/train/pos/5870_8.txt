JACKNIFE is a fine fit of Stephen Metcalfe's game 'Strange Snow' (the manuscript was also written by Metcalfe), sensitively directed by David Hugh Jones, who explores the all too often forgotten effect of combat on veterans permanently damaged by war-like atrocities. It is especially exciting to return to this 1989 film as we look at the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the red treatment they receive in our Veterans Hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two returned live: The problem is that while both men suffered in battle, one David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so severely damaged by post-traumatic stress syndrome that he "exists" in a drunk vacuum with his very clear schoolteacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker). When David worsens his friend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to town to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife initially offered Martha and finally the two days - on a prom Martha must be present - and on that day, Drunken David is completely apart, destroying relics at school and scaring the cities and students. Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their mate, thus bringing David to the point where he can start climbing towards recovery. And the long-standing Martha finds her need also of Jacknife. <br /> <br /> All three actors offer amazingly fine performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most thoughtful roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their career. More people should help revive this all but forgotten movie, as it is a crazy reminder of the damage our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them at the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
