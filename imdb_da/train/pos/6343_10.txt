Let me set the scene. It's the school holiday, and there's absolutely nothing in the cinema. I am with my friend who decides to see. We are looking for a movie that starts soon and "The Grinch" comes up. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we got was a fun slide. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (which I can add is my No.1 actor all over the world) was absolutely magnificent as Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way this movie was made was the scene, the actors, the props and the music just amazing. It really brought to life this childhood film. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of grinch. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who just can't stand Christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never interfered well with the townspeople. But a little girl will change Grinch's look at life and others in a drastic way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actor Taylor Momsem) meets Grinch who finds the friendly part of him immediately. She tries to break the barrier and help Grinch move in and interfere with the city's people. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is a barrel grin for the whole family, both children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
