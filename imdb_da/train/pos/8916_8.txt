Absolutely the very first movie that scared me to death. I happened to catch it when my elder brother (r. I.p.) Looked at it. It was on a black and white television and not really a good picture, but it got me interested. Shortly afterwards, my people bought a color set, and as luck had it, Million Dollar Movie showed it a Sunday. I had forgotten most of the plot, but it didn't take long to catch up ... and I was so scared I had a hard time sleeping at night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that didn't just come from space, but you couldn't hear it, or see it ... and when you got hold of it, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, it still sends a shake up on its back. A true classic, and even better a classic, as I have seen, scares the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long Live The Blob!
