When I was young, I had seen very few movies. My parents rented out all this wisdom. I was very careful about what the movie was about, actually I wasn't even allowed to see it. Of course my brother and sister got it and it made me very angry. So what did I do? Then in the evening I trashed the VCR! Kicked the TV screen in and called the police and reported vandals. Of course, I was arrested, I couldn't get my foot out of the TV before the police arrived. I was only given a string talking to and sent home. Of course, my parents based me and made me work to repay the debt to television and video. This struck me apart, slave work really sucks me, but I had to do it. Chores the whole house. What happened in the end? We have a large TV, DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Easily I made movies and sold them to Disney! Remember to find Neno? Now I wrote the film and filmed my goldfish in their fishing tanks! They rewrote the plot of course and did it in CGI because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture I'd done! Eventually I never saw the movie The Head, which did not die, and the rating I gave it is my life classification! It does well!
