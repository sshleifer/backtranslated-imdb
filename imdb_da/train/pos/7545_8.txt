I really loved it, even though I read the reviews, it was quite disturbing to me. But as an anime art fan, I can fully understand this perfect work of art, although some of it was against my cultures and believe. But hey, it's the world of art .. !! The beginning of the movie is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content, which makes me respect the one who made it. Only a person who is extremely open can make such a bold movie. It is absolutely not for the kids .. even though the characters are cute and adorable, but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be deleted (sorry if the spelling is wrong) from their memory ..
