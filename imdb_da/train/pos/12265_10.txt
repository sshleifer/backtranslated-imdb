"Tintin and I" mainly hit me as a masterpiece documentary. Photography and editing are really breathable (almost anti-dogma). We follow the Tintin drawer Herges life through an open interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these, Hergé has his own demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems to be an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection. Although there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from the Tintin album and also some reconstructions and reading passages from the albums, the story of Hergé is told through interviews and archival material and never through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. But the amazing world that came from his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
