I really enjoyed watching this movie. I lost it while I watched, so I could review it later. I actually enjoyed the other view more, as I was able to absorb more of the wise dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main characters. I thought this story evolved very thoughtfully. I was very fascinated by how Natalie would interact with her daughter's friends. At first, it seemed that she was having to vomit a lot of enmity, but when she began to interact more comfortably, I had to see how this visit unfolded. I was not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets that Sara held by her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not as perfect, a deficient person as most of us who wanted his freedom from a dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter, but Unfortunately, learning in a very painful way, which sometimes really loves someone, you have to give them their freedom. The viewers sitting with this movie eventually saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton (who is always wonderful, even in some of the less well-received films, Town and Country thinks). The final scene of Diane Keaton's driving home was worth waiting for and revealed that anyone who loves another person must learn that we must live our own lives, we love others, but do not own them and ultimately we must leave go. It's a hard lesson, but it's worth considering and now. Thanks to CBS for this broadcast, it was worth waiting a long time.
