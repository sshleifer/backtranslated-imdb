While Rome is crazy, Hitler's celebrations - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders celebrate at home, in a large building and attend meetings. She is Sofia Loren, the wife of a brutal official and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who has been fired because of his homosexuality. Both need business and understanding, both find them in one another. <br /> <br /> The film covers a few hours. The color is faded and everything is done with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio competitors. Strangely enough, the Nazi party - Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up being a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren does a fantastic job, very far away from her usual truck driver's pin-up, Neapolitan fish music personas. Do not miss it.
