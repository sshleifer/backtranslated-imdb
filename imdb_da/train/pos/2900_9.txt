Should this be an American movie, I would rate it 7: we've seen this before. Being this Argentine movie and being Argentinian, I would like to give it a 10, as it's the kind of quality I had hoped for - than expected - for. It's amazing quality is amazing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd world ... I can't forget the scene when Díaz forces Silverstein's fiance to confess - you know what I mean if you watch movies. I think it's the most important moment in the movie, not surprisingly, but still original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to collect some previous information. Being this a mainstream, satyrical, commercial, I press "Play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, I want to say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, but it is credible in a certain way. For me, I couldn't stop laughing at every joke and comment - "sos malo" ("you're mean") ... put in the mouth of Díaz, the greatest. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is a great actor, but sometimes I feel his roles unjustifiably opaque, Luis Luque's role in this case. I'm not very fond of Argentine TV, so I haven't seen much work from Luque, but it's pretty obvious he's an excellent performer. His physical role, his staring, his content position in this movie made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role needs some upgrades just to let him show us how big he can be! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not. I know he won't do that if it's following the rule that "the second part was never good", so if he does, I will definitely see it. And I hope in the future to take into account the possibility of giving Peretti's counterparts the same chances of developing their roles. Great movie, great performances and lots of laughs!
