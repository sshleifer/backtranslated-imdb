I read the negative comments before I saw this movie and undeterred, went ahead and began to see. I admit I had to rewind a couple of times as the movie is incredibly complex, involved and full of detail. It is a good thing, but also quite unexpected in this culture of cargo, explosions, free sex and general violence that replaces plot and character development. In fact, what a welcome departure I am so used to not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This movie is chock full of character development and plot line; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. It really requires mental participation from the viewer. What a lovely change. I would compare it to 'All The President's Men' with regard to generic topic. That is, it is a mystery of the intense error of the elected officials and those with sufficient influence on officials to "own" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike 'All The President's Men', this film makes an effort to give a few characters the current personality. In that sense, the film is a character study like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that movie, their characters are both city employees, and the plot is extremely intense. But the plot is dependent on their characters' ability to cooperate with each other, trust each other and ultimately unite against the corrupt police ministry. There is more gun fire in this movie and the specific plot is different, but generically there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I want to say that City Hall requires a lot more concentration. In fact, I was struck by how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I have seen in my life that goes back to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows something is wrong, for sure! But after the details it is hard to do. This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic for life in its complexity. I think it's one of the reasons why previous posters have criticized the movie: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If one sees this by knowing what to see and is up to, the experience is really great! I saw it 3 times in a row! The action is fantastic and the control is flawless. The weakest connection is John Cusak's accent.
