Having seen "Marrying Mafia", I had almost lost my faith in Korean film business. But this brought my faith back. <br /> <br /> Leading female character who is college student, forced to teach the spoiled, rich but charismatic high school student guy. He is actually female character age. Through some hilarious quarrells, these two become good friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that novice kwan song woo did its job of excellence. He was such a revelation !! The actor Kim has zero was also charming as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie was trying hard to avoid clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it didn't show us any unnecessary nude, sex scenes. It was brilliant, lovely, fresh, made me see it again. <br /> <br />
