And it's a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (when it comes to a movie about disco), it ended up as one of the ultimate movies where kids will rock out, but the main thing stands in the way. Think back to the 50's rock'n'roll movies where the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for the kids, and Tuesday Weld get a new shirt for the dance. Until 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in DA RAMONES, which nobody then realized would become one of the most influential bands in the next quarter century (and then to the obligatory DJ guest shoot, "The Real" Don Steele). Also, throw all the elements of a Roger Corman-produced comedy exploitation movie, except for the two-day shooting plan, some of the well-known Corman repertoire actors like Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (then "Bucket of Blood") and you one of the great stoopidfilm from the day. One of the few films that deliberately uses cheesiness and comes away with it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner-induced drop at the driveway, and he agreed that this is one of the big movies to watch full and not least for the lovely leading ladies and the great Ramones recording.
