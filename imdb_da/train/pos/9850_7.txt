An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, a sloth and a mammoth who rescued a baby who was close to being killed by a group of tigers in the Ice Age. The film's morality shows that good behavior with the others can bring benefits at the end. One of the tigers in the group was given an order to finally catch the child, which was barely rescued by her mother when the tigers attacked her community. The child was then rescued by sloths and mammoths, but the tiger joined them for the purpose of finally removing the child. They went through very cumbersome paths with lots of danger, and immediately the tiger had to fall down and be rescued by the mammoth. In the end, the group of tigers tried to catch the child, but the mammoth helped unbelievably because his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and return the child to his father and society to which he belongs.
