This movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a hard jam, whether financial or emotional. You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace must find a new way of making money, and that's not exactly legal, which adds humor. Even my girlfriend liked it, so don't think it's a chick-flic.
