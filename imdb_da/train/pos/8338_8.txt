This movie is so great. Its recall in probably the 40's and Meg Ryan's character battle to be known as "smart." Plus, Tim Robbins is so sweet in this movie. And everything knows it has a magical feel to it. Every time I see it, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love the music. The violin is amazing. But besides that, I think it's a sweet story, and everyone should see it.
