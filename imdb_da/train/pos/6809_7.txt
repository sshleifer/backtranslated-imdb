This was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I wouldn't take a chance. Nevertheless, the prosecutor reads a scriptwriter, near the end of the movie, and then quotes another from the memory. I can't remember the first passage he reads, but the other is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend the death penalty . It's too bad that prosecutors don't dare quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court's justice in this country's history? He said the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we have lost that view in America.
