A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious infatuation with the 17-year-old boy who lives close by while trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy over her older sister. This is the simple prerequisite for this beautiful, poetic forthcoming movie by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is known for earlier controlling the Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants in the coming age genre. Here, he is leading novices in the lead: Reese Witherspoon, in his movie debut, as the 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as the court, the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good at her movie debut, showing all the feelings that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and evil, never beats a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good. The movie accurately shows every teenager's thoughts or feelings about love with warm sensitivity, and never goes beyond the maudlin itself once. Kudos to the autobiographical manuscript of Jenny Wingfield; This is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple and emphasizes the tone and mood of the scene, but never becomes intrusive. The beautiful movie is by the famous actor Freddie Francis, who was in the 70s when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead target accuracy in 1957, caring, tight and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. There are emotions to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-hearted movie that packs an emotional wallop. To date, it is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best movies in 1991. **** of 4 stars.
