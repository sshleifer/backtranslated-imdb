I looked eagerly at the first series, but wondered if I would go back again after a long break from it. But I voted in episode one of series 2 and was connected again. This is really excellent telly; groundbreaking things like Mission: Impossible back in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded, and the expansion as the series continues, they change as they adapt - slightly more easily than others - to their new surroundings, but they are wisely remained strict in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for A person that you would not have thought you could ever have sad when something really crushing happens to them. I hope there will be many years of 'Lost' to look forward to - and in fact I have nothing so much if I never get answers to all mysteries!
