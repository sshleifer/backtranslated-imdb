In the beginning this is from England, so of course I had 98% chances of it becoming intelligent and very good cinema. I've never heard of this movie before. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here is the feminine version of my left foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. Wrong because the two films are very different. My Left Foot was a John Ford-like movie, and this is a Chaplin-like movie (not because it's fun, but Chaplin in the great sense of melodrama that brings tears to his eyes.) I was right because in 1990 beautiful Daniel Day-Lewis becomes a little ugly by playing a curly person, and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine feelings. The story is well written and it is very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the greatest women's part of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking the Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes in the cinema since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent, as seen in many other films. See this, you won't regret it! And also a very good job at Branagh!
