Marjorie (a gorgeous and gracious performance by Farrah Fawcett) avoids the infection being assaulted in his car by vicious rapist Joe (excellent game with scary conviction and intensity of James Russo). Joe, however, steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He pays a visit to him for a fateful day. After exposing Marjorie to lots of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and lock him in the fireplace. What should Marjorie do to Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone evoke a harsh, greedy and often disturbing moral story that bursts the brutal brutality and painful rape while showing how every person, when pressed to extremities, is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe sees women strictly as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal". However, this movie denies its admirable credit to make Joe appear to be simply a silly one-dimensional crib; instead, he is a scary real and ultimately pitiful human monster with a wife and a child (Joe's climactic confession is particularly genuine). Fawcett and Russo are both excellent in the leaders; They receive good support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin as the sympathetic policeman Officer Sudow. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's appalling, skin-crawling score greatly enhances the significant claustrophobic tension. A real power plant.
