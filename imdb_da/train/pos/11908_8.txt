This movie plays really well with an audience. Especially when the hunt begins. Plus, Trevor Howard with his sensible, elegant charm and Jean Simmons with her innocent behavior and piercing eyes is great together. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out as a psychological drama, but after the murder, it is said in a chase thriller that the two head to the limit. Some may think that chase is superfluous, but in fact chase is crucial because it helps clear the mind of Jean Simmon's character by getting her out of the repressive household, plus it helps bring the real killer out - who is suddenly put in such a position that they have to finish the job. The killer rightly believed that when Simmon's character was arrested, she would be turned away. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing to her - is no way she would have gotten out of the murder. The hunt that comes with helps spread the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie. Find it out if you can find it.
