I have to say that Grand Canyon is one of the most influential movies I've ever seen. I have seen it several times now and I still feel like I did the first time; that this film itself could constitute the entire curriculum for a post-graduate film direction course. <br /> <br /> Long ago movie trailers used to promise, "It makes you laugh, it makes you cry." It is a very quick and concise method to describe what the Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in human experience, and in the next moment you go to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is paced to cycle back and forth between people who are close to happiness and the same people are close to horror. It's always a short step too. Just to cope with the turn of grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is the directorial genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (of varieties) comes up. After getting the audience swinging back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the movie throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but instead escalates from a common marriage strain through an unintentional self-inflicted knife wound that maybe or may not require stitches, for an earthquake that has the characters running from the house. At the moment of their relief, the argument forgot to cut finger forgotten, the earthquake survived, a neighbor's woman calls for her older man to collapse. The couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this order. I cried every time I saw it. I am crying now. It is not grief that makes it to me. It's not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me is that this few minutes of movies was perfect. It's perfect! Amazing. (The spoiler's end) <br /> <br /> There's so much to say about the Grand Canyon. It depicts relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies, and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously. They are not flashy or overblown and there is no long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film continues at the pace of life. Even when the characters try to understand what has happened, they are uncertain of what they should derive from their experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
