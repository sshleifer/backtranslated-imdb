Hi Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The film's main characteristic is definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. Regarding the other characters well, they are well-known transformations of similar action movie stereotypes. Where this movie is original is in the mix of the traditional Hong Kong movie style with Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately, it has not been the case with the films he has made in Hollywood.
