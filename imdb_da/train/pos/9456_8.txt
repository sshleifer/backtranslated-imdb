Unlike many other films that interfere with either their naked discomfort (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), shocks its plausibility. Probably the buggery scene is quite straightforward in its discomfort, but the effect of the film is far from its slow construction and the tangible sense of isolation around the four leaders, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men he had previously played music with, let alone showing a sign of human love towards them, is among the most eerie in modern films. The thrill rises steadily through the canoe trip, and continues even after the final credits - the end makes the meaning of the characters' trials terribly real. The film's plausibility is greatly supported by the rental game, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant, respectively. Also Burt Reynolds has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Carter has done such an effective hatchet job in a tourist industry in a region. I can think of only a handful of movies that put me in such a serious depression after they were finished - The Se7's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent in itself, Deliverance is first and foremost a classic, because there are no appropriate comparisons with it - it is unique.
