I have a two-year-old son suffering from the same conditions as Jonny Kennedy. I never got the chance to meet him, but I never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the program has made, helping his fellow mates to draw attention to this terrible state of affairs. This man has touched people in a way that a million charity brochures could not. I think this should be mandatory to look at the schools. I also agree with other comments - what should I complain about? He took all that life could throw at him and still managed to maintain a sense of humor. God bless. I couldn't see the part that showed that his dressings were changed. I have enough problems with my son's.
