This is a beautiful OK movie ... yes some parts are lame and unusually comfortable, and the film does not really justify the great star molding (AB, SD, Tanuja). But the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not confused with singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can just look at AB continue to stare and not say a word, and still look strong, is certainly a good actor. In fact, he has proved worthy again in Sarkar, along with AB for another time. This guy should get more roles, he is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot and I agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy. And the little love angle he shared with "what's-face" was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to see, always. and AB ... what can I say. I don't know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, considering it's Bollywood, though it is a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
