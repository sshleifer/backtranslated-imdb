In the hands of a more skilled instructor, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. Despite the Michael "Death Wish" winner being the only dangerous direction, the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. The script bucks more than a horror clich√© of the back (more it can't shake) including Chris Sarandon as a heroine lover who actually listens to her as she insists on scary things going down. Burgess Meredith is lovely as the legally crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner scares with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her dumb and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a bad job in a chair. And beware of a short como from an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is scary and creative. The plot twists are lovely, if a bit predictable. The Climax, which I do not want to give details about, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with it, but it is still satisfactory - at least to those with the senses in the seventies horror. <br /> <br /> If you like modern overproduced body-counting torture fantasy, you won It's not like that. There are almost none. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, although there is a lovely makeup at the end - most of which are not actually makeup ... but maybe I have said too much already. <br /> <br /> I rate this a little higher than its quality justifies, but I enjoyed it as much as any "8" movie I've seen.
