The horse is actually a fine animal. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation game. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply overwhelming. The fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses clapped over the girl. So when the stallion crosses different terrain, rocks and braves jump over waters. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is also very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> "They say the history of the West is written from a horse's saddle." Hi? Now the story of a fine horse is probably written from the vest's saddle. All in all, this movie is clearly out there with the best. It's one of the best animation games I've watched. Would be a very fine choice on a lonely evening. An easy 9/10.
