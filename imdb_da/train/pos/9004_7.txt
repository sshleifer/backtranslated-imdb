I had my doubts about another love story where disabled people find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost astonishing, save this from being just another tears. Carter's portrayal of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even exaggerated at times (sometimes the dialogue dissolves in incomprehensible murmurs). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh can be the perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
