The movie was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a nice family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time traveling. The story is about a 14 year old girl, who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator in her apartment complex. Of course, no one believes in her when she tries to explain her disappearance. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and can help the girl's family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a try and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more aimed at children about 6-12 years (maybe a little older) and it is pretty much PG or G rated. I'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - I think the other reviewer is not.
