Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream." These were the psychedelic days in England and America, and these guys saw it: all shining, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues, and it was mostly good stuff. Now these guys are 60 years old and they can still sing and play at high level as this amazing DVD concert disc shows us. I was always very familiar with Clapton, who of course has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither had I seen for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so sad he looked like a freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum player was solid. Bruce looked a little crooked, but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear about these old songs. This is just excellent material and performs from guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this show for being low key. I do not agree. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was excellent, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
