This is my kind of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares, and this movie is just that. But it's also a dark comedy. Although I see it most as a horror / thriller, there will be others who may see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But in a way it's a fascinating lineage in madness. The end made me free but what an end! It gives the viewer a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a good script filled with fear and humor and a creepy atmosphere make this a movie worth watching. <Personally, I think I will have to look several more times to download and understand all the features that are inside. But it is such a movie that it will be a pleasure and not a task to do.
