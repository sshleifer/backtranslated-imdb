I would have given this movie some stars simply because it was a "Lifetime" presentation that was actually filmed in the place represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether there is "seen" in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., are enrolled in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or another Canadian locality. <br /> <br /> But if there ever was a deserving top rating - 10 * on this site, this is this movie. Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with many very similar to this specific. It has also been done quite often on the big screen, with mega stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al. And Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, from the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others you could think of. <br /> Not to be drone, but my point is that in my opinion this is by far the best of this genre I have seen. I caught it randomly on a Friday in the middle of the day, at a time when I had the television on only because I took a few hours after a particularly hectic week. I would never run over this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And while the two leaders have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), whom I had seen in some of her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend), who was excellent as "Gramma", the threatening juice loan , hard, street guy from "Rounders." <br /> <br /> The possibility of meeting and interconnecting the best friends of both leaders, as an under-historical romance, with the link between being so Anna and Charlie only being revealed to everyone later, is an often made plot contrivance within The genre, however, makes no difference to the enjoyment here (actually it increases it). <br /> <br /> Checking some other comments, I totally agree with the most positive ones. The primary word describing this movie is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performing artists; the characters; chemistry between and among all the characters, no matter what combination is presented and all the supporting and equal roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with a "harder edge:" "Rounders" escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even the classics like "Casablanca", "Gone With The Wind", "Citizen Kane." But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this was unique. With a clean portion of their budgets, it was equal to the results obtained by "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; co-stars and support staff were similar to those in these mega movies.
