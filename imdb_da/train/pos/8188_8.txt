I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parties, The Impossible Planet, and was a little worried that the other part would not stop as well as it has been true in the past of the two parties from the last 2 who series. But luckily, my fear was unfounded when I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. At least we start with the surviving crew members on the run from Ood, who has become the Devil's peasant. There is also some philosophy on the doctor's part in the episode, which I totally enjoyed. Needless to say, it was a good solid Doctor Who story. Maybe be a bit too intense for the younger viewers themselves. <br /> <br /> My character: B +
