For those who were interested in knowing how exactly humanity would be encapsulated in large red pods that require me to pomegranate, there is the duo in "Second Renaissance" shorts. I'm not quite sure why they are split into two parts, especially because they are credited as one on the DVD (and seen these shorts on a different format but the DVD), but they are informative even though they have a pair holes. What really makes this first part stand out, from the other part and the rest of the animations, are the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights. Graphic tribute to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and the complex of mankind. In fact, "God" is never really referred by these shorts, instead of being replaced by "Man's own image". <br /> <br /> As far as the shorts go in the collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is by far the most effective in bringing feelings out. It is a sad and disturbing perception of humanity's potential to become "the architect of its own destruction." Some may be rejected by some of the concepts that this card comes directly from previously established science fiction literature, but it is basically what is greatest in the Matrix series, and it has been a driving force behind its success. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
