I am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. The two main players are amazing, the film is never boring, and the concept behind it (although of course it is inspired by the Columbine killings and the murderers' home movies) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses like the last 20 minutes that really detract from the realism seen in the first hour or so, and the end does not make any sense at all. The shaking camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in cinema verite it is a given. But I still think the movie is very well done, and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
