Una giornata particolare is a film that has made brilliant use of enclosed spaces. It is in these boring empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and widespread outbreak of Ettore Scola's two leading figures. Marcel Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated people who decide to come together for some short moments of their listless life. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with signs close to them. All men would really be saddened by Sophia Loren's character. All women will surely cry out their hearts by Marcello Mastroianni's existential situation. Forgotten sexualities are also one of the main problems in this grim, exciting movie. Most of the characters break with questions related to their own sexuality. Una giornata particolare cannot be described as a pro gay movie, although it has been nicely depicted that a gay chap mixes well with women. This is a film that Italian director Ettore Scola has created a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how Hitler's arrival changed the fate of ordinary Italian people. A word about the brave personnage played great by great Marcello Mastroianni. He acts as a genuine man who does not ask for sin. Fortunately, he accepts his destiny and reads himself to face the worst time of his short but meaningful life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
