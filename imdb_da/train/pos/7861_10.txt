Uneducated & defiant, beautiful TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman who hangs on a rich man's land. Spirited & Ball, she catches the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death are what will haunt her near future before she can claim the sweet joy. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming in this amazing, heartbreaking movie. She considered Tess to be her favorite role, and she fills it with all the spunky joy and enthusiasm that made her the world's most popular movie star for many years. The story has all the essential elements of a modern adventure, with Mary the delightful, distressed heroine possessed by all dangerous, stressful situations. The atmosphere is first-class, with the outdoor fishing kits being particularly well-developed. <br /> <br /> In the support, Jean Hersholt stands out as the vain villain who tries to force Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very gentle soul off screen, manages to portray the complete moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> It was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. A 1914 version had been one of her first important films, but its production values ​​were somewhat outdated by the 1920s standards (eg, no close-ups) and Mary, who produced her own films and strong enough in 1922 to do Whatever movie she wanted, decided the only time in her career to resume a movie. The end result certainly lived up to her expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A fascinating study for a future film researcher would be the influence of Christianity in Mary Pickford's life; It certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent films she produced. Although the romantic character associated with the nature of the silent cinema can make these spiritual feelings seem awkward today, we are forced to accept them as sincere reflections upon their very repetitive repetition of Mary's heartfelt faith. In TESS, a beautiful scene stands out in particular in this regard: Pickford teaches himself to read by means of a Bible. She indicates to Lloyd Hughes (who plays her boyfriend) a word from near the back of the book that she doesn't understand. He mimics it for her (the word is obviously 'crucified') and the eyes turned back to heaven as the full meaning of the victim begins on her, Mary's face becomes positively beatiful. <br /> <br /> A fantastic new orchestra score for TESS has been provided by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, who perfectly emphasizes the beauty and patos of this wonderful movie.
