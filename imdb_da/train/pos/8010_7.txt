I thought earlier that this movie was the lame of the Muppet movies. I would now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion, the lightest MUppet movie was the TV movie. IT'S A VERY MERRY MAP Christmas, it's a wonderful life rip off it was really awful. The MAKE'S MANHATTAN is nothing special, but more comfortable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are that 'You can't take a response for an answer' song, one Muppet Babies sings and the songs for the big finals themselves. As I loved Muppet Babie's TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I was told that was what inspired the Muppet Babies show). MANHATTAN MELODIES turns out was the real show stopper with Muppets from Sesame Street even shown to the wedding. As Kermit puts it in its last line, 'What better way can end?'. But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more entertaining. There are sweet comos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the movie certainly hurts. I must say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive MUppet movies.
