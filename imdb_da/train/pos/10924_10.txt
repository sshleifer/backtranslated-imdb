I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We got a brew case and saw this classic! It lost NONE of the original Kung Fu Coolness! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... The DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> <br /> See it soon!
