I found this movie to be exciting right from the start - like a Spielberg movie - and found the plot to be exciting as I was trying to figure out what the current situation was. <br /> <br /> Right from the start - before the opening circuit - the action starts, bring it instant voltage. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very sympathetic. (I'm having trouble suffering from Baldwin's because of Alec's extra-curricular political activities, but William wasn't that bad in this movie.) <br /> <br /> There were several very unexpected phrases that helped for pleasure. Unfortunately, there were many places where there was an annoying loud tone in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suppose the microphone picked up camcorders on the set.
