Despite being told from a British perspective, this is the best WW II documentary ever produced. Presented in digestible (as digestible as war may be) episodes such as Laurence Olivier's tomb link the volumes of eyewitnesses who were forced to live the events of the horrible time. Eagerly waiting for the look of DVD in the US. Europeans had the opportunity to publish in DVD earlier this year.
