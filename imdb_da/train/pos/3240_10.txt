I found this movie by mistake many years ago and wondered then (still doing) why it didn't get the recognition it should have. Well written, beautiful play, an ironic twist after another, and there is easy understanding of what the shameful characters are trying to do. I would not recommend this movie to people with short attention tensions; It requires sufficient intelligence to understand that there may be a core of truth in this story.
