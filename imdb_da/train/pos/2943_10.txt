I still think it is the best routine. There are some others that Rocks "bring the pain" and Allen's "men are pigs" who are funny; "Damon Wayne's last stand" is also fun in a tearful way - but this routine has no flaws. All jokes are fun, and the 70-minute deadline is perfect. Just long enough for the last 20 years. I just love how he allows the audience to be completely self and unlimited. I'm a fan of the classics, and for a guy who so much of Jim Carrey grows up, seeing a more laid back cartoon is pretty cool. Don't put in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can see if you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, god bless.
