This is a good movie. Something fun to see money is blown at a super rate, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a child's dream that comes true and what a child can do with $ 1 million dollars. Don't like it, don't see it. They make movies for the viewers, not the people who have nothing better to do, so complain in their lives.
