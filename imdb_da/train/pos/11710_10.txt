Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins wanted to shake the world of the Christian subculture (and get millions in the process) with the LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company for Billy Graham's evangelical association, gave us this masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" blast, we sit in the living room and hear about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it. The premise of the film is founded in the Pre-Millenial Pre-Tribulation eschatalogy, assuming Christ once made the secret of taking the true Church, and then it comes back to the end of the seven-year-old hell on earth. What used to scare me in junior high makes me laugh. Patty's thrilling adventure and her journey through tribulation (and two of the film's three successors) tell her remarkable story of disbelief and ultimately condemnation. I hate to admit it, but I still thoroughly enjoy seeing this. It even has the same EXACT score of Monty Python and Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to do this observation.
