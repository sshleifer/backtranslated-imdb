I just watched the movie two days ago, and I was full of expectation that Paris is my second best city in Europe, and I spent a very romantic 18 months there in the 80s. I was a little disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, while original and artistic, did not catch the city's light and beauty very well. Not enough of the romance! We didn't see any of the tree-bound boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not just literally but figuratively. Some of the plotters manipulated the viewer, thought it, and let him / her down "flat" (the Marais sequence, the corked seller sequence, to give two examples). The uplifting good: The Mime sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (although it left too much for the viewer to understand), the "Cowboy" vignette and the Sacre Coeur seemed a little and far between, and I would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor like Orlando Bloom be in something that would have shown her originality more.
