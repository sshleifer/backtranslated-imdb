Freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy, gangster, "stoner" movie, and a british British movie. <br /> <br /> It's the brilliant main characters that put this movie apart from other movies in this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a good chemistry and make their characters very cozy and realistic. The main story is centered around their car journey from London to Wales, and adventures and mishaps that occur along the way. This little movie also has a good heart - it's not just for cycling fans, as it relies on the character's relationship with each other, including dreams and regrets that Gary Stretch's Fred longs for the family he left behind. The cinematography is also fantastic - a love letter for the Welsh landscape, as well as capturing London's streets and typical public in the Welsh towns. Stylish, smooth, amazing soundtrack, sympathetic character and fun story - I'd recommend Freebird in a heartbeat!
