The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film more than pure entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was presented to kill his old identity: he really killed one who became his body. But the film finally reveals that all of this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program, which is also obviously revealed in this film, with the purpose of eliminating any American citizen who tried to prevent control of the entire community by an established and limited group of people. Who was an important CIA officer until 1980 when he became Vice President? It goes along with what is being said on the internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the most important person who will be able to bring this truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation . A woman and the senate; read my lips. In the United States, media policy is struggling and two media are crucial to any presidential campaign: it's music and cinema. Currently Hollywood and beyond intelligentsia use the academy and intellectuals in the cinema generally and especially this film to build the public idea of ​​salvation coming from a woman and from the senate. Then go see the movie. It's pretty entertaining and it has the sweet scent at the end of a period and some of the great changes that some are waiting for and others are waiting for, but no one can pretend it doesn't come. The only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.
