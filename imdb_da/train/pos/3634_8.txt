I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something challenging for an evening. I went out of the theater quite happy and a little surprised. This is a very fine baseball tribute film, and a good lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a few hours of your time!
