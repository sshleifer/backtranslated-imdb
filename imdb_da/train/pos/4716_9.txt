This movie is just for fun, a completely non-PC gangster torso. If Mel Brooks made a picture about Mob in the 30s, it would probably look like this. For many great one-liners to remember, and while it's not for everyone, no one who doesn't laugh a whole lot of times doesn't have a pulse. Then put it on and RUN Iceholes !!!
