RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their major budgetary efforts to redeem at The Thin Man's popularity. They managed to some extent. Many people forget that Bill Powell, in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles, also played in a pair of Philo Vance movies in the title role. So at this point he was pretty well set in the role. Doctor Bradford does not make as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic blas√© Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles is married to an heir, Dr. Bradford works to live as a doctor. It helps in his afocation of detective and actually does it in this movie. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to solve. A jockey falls off a horse that enters a large race and dies without apparent reason. The coach suspects something, but he is hit by the more conventional method of a ball. This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a more stable influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur plays it like a staggering lady than Loy did. But it works here, and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Ever reliable James Gleason is a police officer in the Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton role. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore when Powell's butler was essaying that part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed to this study, we could have seen a whole bunch of Bradford movies.
