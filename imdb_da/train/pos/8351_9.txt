I remember hitch hikes to Spain at 25, getting a lift off, turned out to be, two fly Italian small villains. They do much outside the law, but on the other hand carry a small portrait of Jesus in their pockets for their protection ... Just and unfairly, good and bad, criminal and correct, where in a new combination outside categories I used to know 'Les Valseuses', even though a movie and not real life, gives me a picture close to my own experiences: the intensity of each moment as soon as you leave 'behind' and go for the insignificant whatever comes your way , it is another state of mind and also 'dangerous' way of life, because as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and willing to pursue you to steal and so on ... This film touches on values, is a story of 'what is right and wrong': morality. It is the individual's resurrection that fights himself against "false morality" and conformity. There is danger all the way, for how far can you go with your own freedom and cross your own moral limits and other people? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in prison or even shoot at you for the things you do, like stealing some petrol from a multinational oil company to your fifth hand car? Les Valseuses relaunches these questions in me because morality, unlike the usual 'media message', is quite complex ...
