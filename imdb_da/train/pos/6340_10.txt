First, an explanation of what makes a great movie for me. Excitement by not knowing what's coming next, makes me enjoy a movie the first time I see it (case a point: Twister). There are other things that go into a fantastic first impression as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas is MANEN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Sign. That being said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the casting was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch's is excellent and very fun and / or heart-warming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the comic. Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can't get started because I don't want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very fun as The Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and compositions. Very good work Jim Carrey-I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to watch the movie at least once. On your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? It is an indecent area for a 7 year old (indecently meant in the best possible way). Good work. This is the best performance of a child I have ever heard in a movie (Taylor knocked out Von Trapp Children-no small feat!). And now for the actors. Jim Carrey was great, fun and surprisingly very sensitive (this really turned out in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's outspoken expression (one of the secrets to a good play) is very strong - she really gets Cindy Lou Who. And when she does dialogue, she is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ***************************** fare: spoiler alert ********* ************ *************************** *********** ******************************* <br /> <br /> Examples: expressions when she first sees The Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You are it," and then filled in with the Grinch line "then then the GRINCH - after which she falls into the sort and then rescues by The Grinch)." Thanks for saving me "The Grinch's quote and subsequent replies were also very good. My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to Holiday Cheermeister. This scene is two great actors at their best interactive and expressing each other. Taylor Momsen sticks to Jim Carrey in this place, and I sincerely hope we can see Taylor Momsen in several more films, all in all, all was well with this movie (except perhaps the feet and the noses).
