Famous were "famous" for their thrill and release style of cartoon, where the half-man is in terrible danger, but only to be rescued by the hero in the last minute. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a good ending. The constant in famous comics comics is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always comes to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always jumps the fox, Little Audery "always learns his lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You need to give them credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I don't think anyone should put a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer.
