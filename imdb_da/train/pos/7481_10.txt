I couldn't agree more with the quote "this is one of the best movies ever made." If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-make," you can't be wrong. There is tremendous depth in this movie: visually, musically and emotionally. Visually because the movie is soft and delicate at times (early stages with Sofia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> The music and sounds tie in this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, but eclectic, score for the movie, which could not be more suited to such a dream theme (although I was never released, I could get my hands on the original score of about $ 60. If you look hard, You may find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical choices, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Victory Ros, Monkees, etc. Is also perfect fit for the movie (Crowe has a penny for good music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes of this movie (ie, love, sadness, regret) are very powerful and amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the brilliant dialogue; I admit that the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes again and again. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this movie is that it is so intelligently designed that every time you watch the movie, you will catch something new - so be careful and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second clock, but there is always more to the story than you think. This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work and all in all a work of brilliance. Much of my film production and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art tends to do. It surprises me all the time that there are many people who cannot appreciate this movie for what it is (I believe understanding real art is an art itself). Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
