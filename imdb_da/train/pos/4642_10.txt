The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed that point. It is obvious that he has not been young or innocent for a very long time, or he could have understood that the tragedy was that the well-meaning young characters actually believed they could make a difference by putting posters and keeping a rave for peace . Only if it was so easy. But the sexes sit and sneak at people who are seriously trying their best to do things better, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. <br /> <br /> The central theme is that revenge begins more revenge, which begins even more in an ever-growing carnage. Both sides will tell you stories of atrocities perpetrated by the other side, as they believe, justify committing even more in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he lacked the meaning of the "bubble" referred to in the name, which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (He also thought Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without any problems, telling me he was not aware when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) I found it very discouraged by the director, scriptwriter and both star crosses lovers, to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled country and make both lovers male. Let's be honest here: Very few people would have a problem if one of them was a woman (young love wins all hearts) - but when people's anxiety with their sexuality is added to the fact that they get them HATE each other, then the conclusion is inevitable.
