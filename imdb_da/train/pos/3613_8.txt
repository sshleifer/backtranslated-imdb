When "Girlfight" came out, the reviews praised, but I didn't come around to see it. I finally saw it when it was released on video and understood the glowing reviews. The film opens in a gymnasium in the middle of a ghetto. We are soon introduced to students Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad expression on her face, and any idea of ​​Diana that we can get out of this expression is soon confirmed when she comes in a fight. When Diana gets into trouble for this, we meet her father, an aggressive type in itself; Obviously, we cannot blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then, the film really captures as a new thought leaps into Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this gloomy existence. Her older brother has already been boxing, but her father is unlikely to approve. Only Diana can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes alone identified that I was in a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but John Sayles' brief appearance in a supportive role really confirmed it. Even before they come to any boxing scene, you feel as if you are being beaten by seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally come to the film's main story, no one is returning. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that the use of boxing as a means of showing that someone is trying to make something of themselves has been a kind of cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think they did a good job with this. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its peak. Really good. Hard to beat Michelle Rodriguez in Hollywood movies after that.
