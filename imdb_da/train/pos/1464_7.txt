More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better like a header. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you want) shows pictures here in his own way. Most of them are classics, but all are listed here on IMDb, and I strongly recommend you to watch them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation & Lynch movies) because Slavoj Zizek will refer them! <br /> <br /> In other words, he can destroy them for you. I can't remember if he spoiled more than the ones I mentioned (I also think the Chaplin movies), but as I wrote, it would be best if you look at them all in advance! In the IMDb directory there is a movie that I reported to them so it can get up there very soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a brief excerpt that's not great for a deal. <br /> <br /> Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you are open to seeing things through a different perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a little for you ... doesn't mean it will do it but it could)!
