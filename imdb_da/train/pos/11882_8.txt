This movie was a while in my collection, but it wasn't until a friend of mine reminded me of it ?? until I decided I should see it. I didn't know much about close to Leo ?? just that it should be excellent coming out of age movies and it is dealing with a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has the aids ?? is Leo ?? The scenario wraps the way Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) cuts with his family's illness. Initially, everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel ?? He is thought to be too young to understand his brother's disease? that Leo is also gay, contributes to the parents' unwillingness to discuss the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that most older people do not often accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that he will not be able to accept reality and act more appropriately than himself. Except that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left a pretty impression for me ?? the way they supported their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his illness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex girlfriend was quite a gesture from them? Most families I know will be reluctant to do so. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together? You can see them being real friends, worries about each other. <br /> <br /> Close to Leo is an excellent drama that I highly recommend
