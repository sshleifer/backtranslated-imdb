After reading some of the other comments here, I was expecting something really terrible but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not that good. I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved. Apart from the car gates and Daisy Duke's legs, the scriptures were weak and badly acted. Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for the backwood hicks, the curved Boss Hog was too cretinous to be wicked and Rosco was just hyper in every screen moment. It's amazing that the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of stories during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you see this movie in itself, not as a direct comparison with, but you remember the TV series, then it is not bad at all. Of course, the real star is General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann Scott Scott as the cousin Bo couple make this movie really fun in a fun dumb-and-dumber kind of television series never achieved. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a credible ugly Rosco P. Coltrane, whom he should always have been. <br /> <br /> If you don't like slapstick humor and crazy car jumping, then you wouldn't see this movie anyway because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want an entertaining car movie with a few good laughs that are not for taxing on the brain, then watch this cozy body with an open mind.
