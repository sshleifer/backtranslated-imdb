Steve Carell stars as a person that you can relate to (kind of) in Dan in reality, a movie I didn't expect to like, but ended up suffering it. Not that the movie laughs out loud, it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what fans of the office would expect to see from him, but you know what I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell stars like Dan Burns, a widower whose daughters don't really like him. A weekend he and his daughters travel to see their family. As he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. When he comes back to his house, he finds out that his brother Mitch (The Game of Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> In fact, at times, I found a bit incredible. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who work together and play board games together and do a lot of other family things? I would very much doubt that. I don't know any family that is like that. Is it stopping me from giving it a thumbs up? No <br /> <br /> Dan really: *** / ****
