Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an elderly man and on honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with the marriage and the love of love makes Eve back to her father's home on a farm and leaves her husband. One afternoon, as she bathe in a lake, the horse escapes with her clothes and a young worker picks up and returns them to Eve. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later her husband misses her and tries to get Eva home. Eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place and ends the case in a tragic way. I just watched "Extase" for the first time, and the first remark I have is compared to the horrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian Distributor Video Network: the movie has only 75 minutes of play and it looks like that different rolls of film were used. There are some parts completely damaged and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very bold, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the current beauty standards. Another great point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers that symbolize intercourse between Eve and her lover. The way the instructor performs the scenes to show Eva's needs and secrets is very clear. The non-crucial end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but one day I hope have a chance to see an 87 minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "asextase" ("Ecstasy")
