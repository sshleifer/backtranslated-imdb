Back to the cottage by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original. It had black humor, good suspension, nice look girls, and of course a psychic killer. What do we miss? I don't think anything. Except that we are left with a small amount of doing and nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to see as a family. Recommended for everyone.
