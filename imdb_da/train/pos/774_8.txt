I think it is a good movie; I think it's a very Romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); I think it's very natural; I think it's human; I thought it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think ... waw lame acting (they are not Sean Connory & co) nor is the movie a block bust, they are like the movie ... normal ppl that can act .. .; I think the movie reached its intention; I think it made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... as I know.
