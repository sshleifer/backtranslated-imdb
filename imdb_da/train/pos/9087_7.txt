Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a study contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, great selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new image. In a panic, the study fetches Lookalike Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to imitate her and get Bowers to take her to the premiere. Don't tell him it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can basically figure out the rest of the plot yourself. The plot is old (to put it nicely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very sympathetic couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical order (with Edgar Kennedy making his patented slow burn). Glenda Farrell also has some fun pieces like Mona's sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> The movie is still not that good. The rest of the molded mug is wild, and most of the humor is just not fun. Lola Lane is especially just miserable trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black girl is being played for laughs, and there is some really terrible racist "humor" at some point. It's probably what keeps it television most of the time. I am aware that it was accepted at that time, but it comes across as outrageous today. All in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some good songs. I give it a 7.
