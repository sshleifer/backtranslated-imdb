I watch this movie again and again. I have to see it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel's films are all full of lessons for people in the community. I wish he was my own brother. I've also seen and love your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to tie up his brother at work, he reminded me of my teenage years when my brother was always upset with me getting me to record all the time. My brother was always worried about my old father and he would like to see me the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get the African accent from the Cry Freedom movie? I first saw that movie in Africa, and I didn't know Denzel was American until I moved in here.
