An excellent film depicting the cross-currents of life for a multi-ethnic mix of not so common people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid steer and write along with fine actors, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the very successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of action may not be as boring as that of City Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "Except", but the personal relationships between the characters are so flawed and troubled, and their stories as resonate like any of them in "Crash". For those viewers who appreciate "Crash", this is a must see movie. Also fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.
