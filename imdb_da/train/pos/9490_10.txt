The first time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but reviewed, this thriller is still really. Some recent films focus on similar topics, but they do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> A president - of course, JF Kennedy - is being shot in an open car under a public look. The resulting huge survey finds the "Lee Harvey Oswald" image of this movie guilty, but a jury member insists on further investigation. He reveals some surprising evidence ... Unlike Oliver Stones JFK - a movie with the same plot - it does not play with emotion, but concentrates on an exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of the murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this film is more sensible, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot are found in many recent films, I had some kind of deja vu sometimes in the cinema. "I ... comme Icare" is a "must see". Its unique and brilliant, and the music of Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good location, if it was a Hollywood production, it would probably be famous. <br /> <br />
