What a fascinating movie. Although not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a designer in her element. And this is the kind of film psychology that students could study to learn about compulsive addicts. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media, but this step really gives her plenty of opportunities to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the phrases she takes through the documentary are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book but just heard good reviews and went to see it on the dull rainy afternoon. The journey this movie takes you on is clever, interesting and quite exciting.
