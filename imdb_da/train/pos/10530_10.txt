What a lovely movie ... With the lush, emotional and dreamy music of the Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN, this movie is a joy to see more than once a year. <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was fascinating to see that one finds herself on the edge of their seat, just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her. One of the most inviting characters I've encountered in ages. From one of the open scenes, when she thanks Mr Woodhouse for sending "the lovely quartet of pigs ... Pork, MOTHER !!!" She shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing-impaired mother, Mrs Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who looks abandoned and lost. <br/> <br /> The comic ways Emma wanted to avoid the grid Miss Bates, build herself up for a really gutsy scene in the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates, who takes her gruesome graves to her heart. We see such poor Miss Bates tribe and on the tears' borders and just as shattered you can't help but feel the heart rip on her behalf. It's a classic scene, one must be rewound and played over and over ... The end is right up there with "Sense & Sensibility" and gives one of life's greatest lessons on how to marry a best friend ... < br /> <br /> I hope this movie will leak you all as much as it has me. <br /> <br /> I ADORED IT!
