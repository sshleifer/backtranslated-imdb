About a year and a half ago my father told me about the French doors. I thought it sounded interesting enough, but I didn't try to find it anywhere. So about a year ago, I remembered that movie and thought "Hi why not" and tried to find it on the internet. finally after approx. a week to see I found it on atomic film. I called my father over to the computer and said to him, "Hi father I found the creepy movie you told me many years ago!" He smiled at me, turned around, turned off the lights, so it was pitch-white except for the computer screen and told me to see it. I started fine ... So when he started to worry about what was there, I found it very uncomfortable. at the end I pushed back my chair and got up ... it made me jump !: P If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you because it's worth it. Even after the fourth or fifth time it is still worrying. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM!
