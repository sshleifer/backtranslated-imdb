The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy's art, his quest for closeness with the earth and the water, and his sense of proportion - and gently saw the beautiful weather it back to film for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" love Goldsworthy's work and join it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a floating world, a world that conceals its power in the ordinary sight. Watch this movie!
