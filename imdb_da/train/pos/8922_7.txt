The only remarkable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major lead. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. Steve turns out to be the anti-establishment hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years thus. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say he hated this movie and "he was blob". But everyone has to start somewhere, and The Blob is sweet, fresh and innocent. Would that we all had been that way. <br /> <br /> The reason is quick and though predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. And it's great fun to see Steve McQueen before becoming King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before becoming Andy Taylor's boyfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD some time back, and it's a worthy addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
