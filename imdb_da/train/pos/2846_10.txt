I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who's seen this movie a few minutes ago .... And I'd like to thank people who worked to create this movie! It's not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I want to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible .. it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without regret about the time wasted on seeing it! It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but sometimes we miss it because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have, but we miss it. ... why do we do that? We must live as if to die ... care for every second and remember: if we do good things, the good things come back to us! .and it has a special taste in new york ... i love this city and the world we live in !!!! thanks for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (english is my second language) ...
