Nothing revolutionary here; GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively confined to a killing police station, and mostly to an interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful movie THIS SWEET SICKNESS among others) intercalates extra glimpses of outer taboos as minimalist local scenography. Miller's restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the associated interior mise-one scene provides a captivating view. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is great as usual and manages to legitimize a character that is paper clich√©: the laconic, hardnosed, world-famous murder detective. Ventura lives that role, making it completely credible, even though the manuscript gives us little access to his inner work; The movie ends in the moment it seems he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time. Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child murderer, who sparsely saves on single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often than not pregnant with tensions and the aura of a constant metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. However, Serrault's character is terribly hampered and listed and pitiable; so later .... the GARDE A VUE "message", if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressure that makes a policeman overweight to if necessary close cases at the expense of justice. For the most part, its length shines as nothing more than an example of how to transform a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into an exciting drama of the greatest movie economy. <br /> <br />
