David Beckham is a British football star and the man of Victoria Beckham (Spice Girls' Posh Spice). His trademark is a target shot that curves across the track and into the net. The football equivalent of an inept baseball ball. "Bend it as Beckham" means making that kind of spectacular shot. Apart from that, and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo at the end, the film has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of little football in battles, such as one of the character's parents giving her a jersey with number 9 on it (ownership of the big Mia Hamm, to those in the know ), references to "Posh 'n' Becks" video tribute to WUSA one of the characters playing for a disbelieving friend ("they * have * it?"), lesbian gags, sports bra gags etc. The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA) and her parents, who are Indian immigrants put in very old-fashioned ways that do not allow daughters among other things to participate in contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as ironic fun characters, but with great love - think my Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to hide her growing football ground from them.
