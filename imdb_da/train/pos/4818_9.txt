I always have some distrust before I see the movie in the British period because I usually find them incomplete and boring screenshots (such as the Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a magnificent production design, European landscapes and the thick British accents that make the films suggest artistic value that they do not really have. Fortunately, the excellent movie The Young Victoria does not fall into that situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating history, the outstanding performances of Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent and the costumes and places that unexpectedly make the film right on the view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I don't usually pay too much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> The "Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the main points of contemporary civilization, and not just the social aspect, but also the scientific, artistic and cultural. I didn't honestly know about the origins of that era, and perhaps because of that, I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that prepared the landing of the modern era so much. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is portrayed, a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but at least inspired by good intentions. I also found the image of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is as interested in the combination of intellect as well as in the emotions it evokes. The only flaw I found on this movie is that scriptwriter Julian Fellowes used some clichÃ©s of the romantic cinema on the love story, something that feels a bit out of place on his script. /> <br /> I liked The Young Victoria a lot and I really took a very good surprise with it. I hope that several period films follow the example of this movie: costumes and landscapes will serve as support for an interesting story, not as a substitute for it.
