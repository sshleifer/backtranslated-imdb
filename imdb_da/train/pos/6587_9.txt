Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", is the first feature-length Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett I've seen. The story is interesting and dark. The movie has a slightly sad, sad feel, but it is quite entertaining (with some particularly fun scenes). * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson tries to uncover the identity of an illusive extortionist who has destroyed some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that will somehow destroy their lives. They eventually find that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer", following the few tragic consequences for victims who did not pay. Our heroes have to help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay an amount outside her meaning otherwise her future marriage will surely be abolished. The scene where Holmes and Watson burglary Milverton's house is intense. Although the film has a really good ending, the tone is sad and enchanting. Excellent performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a rebellion). I give it a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough inspector Lestrade. (I wish they would have added to the scene at the end of the short story, describing the description of the two burglars, one of which matches Watson.)
