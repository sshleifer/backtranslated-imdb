Dick Tracy is easily the best cartoon-based movie to date. The movie has the same feeling as the comic book that adheres to the color scheme. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has genuine resilience as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The good guys triumph over the evil, without blood and do to get a point across. Al Pacino does a wonderful job with his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best job by far is Warren Beatty, who just indicates Dick Tracy, just as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is thin.
