One such masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was, the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is all a follow-up. It does not go on the toes of its predecessor, preferring to leave the legend, which was the first film to live in unprecedented unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The Man From Snowy River II is based on Jim Craig for the Snowy River country after a three-year absence. The film tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century, of Australian history, play and horses. The storyline demonstrates a hint of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, but this blends in unambiguously with a clear sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is far more vibrant than the first movie, and much more flashy, with particular aspects of the previous film incorporated, but The Man From Snowy River II possesses all essential characteristics of the first film; sensationally beautiful filmography, a stunning focus from the Australian Highlands, the second-most impressive shooting of ever-filmed horses, and a stunning and in-depth soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, similar to the first in every way. Geoff Burrowes has done an excellent job on this movie and it is well worth acknowledging, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. The main role, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy, carry their parts with so much passion and distinction as the first movie. As far as successors can go, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; an in-depth and inspiring experience again.
