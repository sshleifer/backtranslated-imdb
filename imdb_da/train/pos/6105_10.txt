All Kira Reed fans should see this. The film's premise has fought Romanesque novelist Kira unable to come up with new ideas. She also gets a divorce. But she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothes). They go into a corner room and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom out (never tell me that these Playboy movies are worthless piles of soft fluff. Remember kids, probably sex). Later, she amazes her publisher, how big it was, but she didn't get her name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky game. But in the end she carries out her sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, the hell goes loose and I leave it with it. This is easily the best of these softball-core Playboys movies I've seen. Check this out and wonder about Kira's grandeur.
