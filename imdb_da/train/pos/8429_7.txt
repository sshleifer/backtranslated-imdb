An absorbent (though repeated and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up, where attempts to make yourself better offending and putting down who is below you seem to be the only option. But even here in this desolate desolation of lost dreams and no future that does not work and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with, a simple act of charity, gives some rewards, even if it just makes the present sustainable to revive memories of the past. Although there is not much actually on the screen violence, it is a tough and brutal movie about the repression (political and personal) that does not make it easy to entertain. Clearly based on a game with a small cast, a broader expansive relationship to the general social and political environment might have helped the film reach a wider audience.
