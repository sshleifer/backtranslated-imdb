This movie is an exact replica of a television series on Indian TV channel doordarshan, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series became known as "bullies", which means balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job, but he doesn't fit the role of a "normal" and "third class" guys (as he calls himself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi with his hair short and without designer clothes would have fitted Abhay's role, but Shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off. <br /> <br /> I would suggest seeing the series if available. It is the same story except running around with the friend's mother and the introductory introduction. The TV actors' performance was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason these movies are a flop is that the instructor tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) to 2+ hours. So it has to be sad. Even the nasal song sensation songs couldn't compensate. <br /> <br /> These movies are good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and are really refreshing if you haven't seen the original TV show. The script and the end of the serial number were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ################################# ################## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ####### SPOILERS AHEAD ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ##### End of The original series was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl herself thought she was willing to marry him. HE is aware and tells her that he does not want to be "repaid" and never helped with that intention. The director or script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this movie. The original end would have bought tears for the girls' eyes and would have gotten the boys nodding by appointment. The delivery was just not real. <br /> <br /> But I think this is a pathetic copy. Credit must not be given to the director / scriptwriter. The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novelists he he class of PRemchand munshi. I'm not sure if this is premchand munshi's story, but many of the other short stories in the series include some of premchand munshi's and other amazing Hindi writer stories.
