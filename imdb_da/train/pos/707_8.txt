Must be honest and say I haven't seen many independent movies, but I thought this one was very well done. The direction and cinematography were engaging without being distracted. The angles, settings and lighting that were used created the nightmare world where the main character was captured. Many haunting and memorable images from the film keep you in mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good instructor).
