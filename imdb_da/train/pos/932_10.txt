********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe this was a made for television movie. Just the term "made of TV" makes me shaky. The production values ​​of television films are almost always remarkably lower than the production values ​​of professional film studios. That said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should have been released in theaters because it is so good. It is my personal favorite of all the "Christmas Carol" films because all aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some smaller on-screen glitches with two of the ghosts visiting Scrooge, but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a few bugs. <br /> <br /> Scott turns in a starring game like Scrooge, he is a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can't think of a performance in this movie that shouldn't be applauded. Costuming, location shooting and winter background are fascinating. The musical score is endearing and heart warming. Add to it, solid control, flawless filmography and faithful scripting; We have here what one day will be considered a holiday classic. It really hasn't been long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day it will soon be. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home, because it highlights the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness and giving. As a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol" with the star George C. Scott.
