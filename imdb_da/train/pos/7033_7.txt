First of all, don't call this a remake of the '63 movie. Although this version is more threatening to the stage game, it is extremely long. The castings were good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good molding choice. She was almost 30 when she made this movie and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates her part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was fun as Harry McAffee and showed he could even hold a tune. Like the '63 movie, they threw an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie, and it showed. I even have the soundtrack and I love listening to his song. So what made this a flop of TV rating? It was far for one. They set new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (like "Let's settle down"), was it really necessary? Now I am not mistaken, I liked it, but I rather look at the '63 movie (see my review). It was just the case with some actors who handed over roles, made some changes, and again LENGTH. One thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give her some lyrics and she could sing them. So here's my advice that comes from someone who has made a few productions by Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to see an entertaining play, watch the '63 movie. To see a more threatening version of the game, see the '95 version. Just take it in moderation yourself. Don't be a hero and try to see it all in a meeting.
