one of the best low-cost films from Germany! is this the dark side of the new age? If you believe in esotericism, don't face this movie! It blows away all your positive fantasies. This film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope there will soon be a 35 mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area that makes movies with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
