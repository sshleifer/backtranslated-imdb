The documentary begins with setting the perspective for several light years. The traveler raises our milk path with the sound of our earthly life as a space monument for (possible?) Extraterrestrial. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains recordings of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. The recordings of J.B. has never been published before. The story is from 'blind Willie' Dixon. However, this is done by an actor. The film shows the work of all these early blues men followed by covers and interpretations of musicians such as Nick Cave and the bad frogs among others. <br /> <br /> The death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a striking event in history. Lenoir became politically engaged and considered the league of Martin Luther King and peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his texts. <br /> <br /> Blues are found to be 'THE' native music in America. Blues are the roots and the rest are the fruits. <br /> <br /> The title 'Soul of a Man' is after a Willie Dixon song.
