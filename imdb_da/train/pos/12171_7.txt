I literally prepare to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this movie is worth watching. All in all, the story and the gags are designed, but the film has the charm and subtlety of pulling them out. The gag, where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and colleagues see him scraping himself, is not terribly intelligent, but it gave me a brittle laugh. Very few of the film's gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and charm a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also sympathetic. I must say that I wish I should see more of James Brolin's character when he was a hoot in the few scenes he was in. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage not to make wife's character (who serves as a hindrance in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikely and there is never a scene where I thought of myself: "Why did he want to marry her in the first place?" The end is Hollywood ish, but it could have been much more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> Cast is talented. I haven't had a positive outlook on most of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I loved him just as much in Kevin Smith's films that I couldn't help but feel disappointed about seeing him in these dopey roles. And he never looks good in these dopey roles. Even in this movie he does not look perfect, but he contributes his own two cents and handles each scene effectively. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles again shows why she is so boring. Of course she is a very beautiful girl with a brilliant smile that makes me weak, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, her beauty shows in and out. I don't know the actress's name, but the woman who plays the full grandmother is fun. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and she is always fun to watch, which makes me want her to have better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills. <br /> <br /> Don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible cash accounts. This is a fun, charming movie. Romantic comedies become so predictable today that it feels as if the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it is always to see a good one among all those bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
