I have to give it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" films. "Direct to DVD" is typically synonymous with cheap, incompetent film making. Last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy but fun little movie. This year, they are bidding on the follow-up, "Beta House". This is the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first few "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> These are no barriers, tasteful, grinning, fun. Sure, the story is a little thin, but it's the beauty of beauty. Within the first 10 minutes we are introduced to all the main characters, the new supporting characters, get a handful of raunchy gags, meet the bad guys and establish the general plot line. With all that out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limits ride. Gags are a lot, and they did not hold back in this. I speak sperm, urine, dildos, chicks-with-dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays and more. Not to mention the fact that there is no moment without breasts or a sex scene. Back from "The Naked Mile" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supportive role as the last few films). The whole cast works fine. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) especially has a great energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film is also packed with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the movie for me was "The Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, if you are a fan of the series, you will feel at home with the "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end is pretty amazing fun.
