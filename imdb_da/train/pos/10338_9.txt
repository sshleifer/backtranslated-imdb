Norman, is that you? was (this is the third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish as it made the transition from the stage and on the screen. It was also one of the films that were originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater could not have been so great. Still, the ideas of Redd Foxx and others were quite good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIODEPIECE: it reflects the mid-early 70s attitudes to finding that you have a gay son or daughter in Your Family. For that reason alone, it is quite interesting - if not a little "hollywood". Don't believe me? Check lines on curtains etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side split scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife who runs away with her brother (!) To Ensenada in a soup pinto. The cross-border phone conversation is truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did his / her gay routine, which he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time the routine was filmed. And it is a slightly tidy and much shorter version, I am told. Yet it is vintage Madame and should not be missed. People still steal lines from Wayland; The man was really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
