HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of Shemp Classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The movie's new cooking scene at the start of the movie is fantastic. Stooges are always fun when they cook. But after the first few minutes of cooking, we record original recordings of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes is that they fit the new story. They make a bet shot if the old story line doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> HOUSHANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars.
