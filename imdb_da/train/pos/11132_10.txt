Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shocked by a joking childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He finishes his work as a dishwasher and goes on to become a hustler for wealthy people. He meets a misfit named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other out. They will be twenty. The two grow remarkably dense and may not live without each other soon. However, there is something very important that Ratso has not told Joe and it can destroy any hope they have to survive the city together. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a heartbreaking and crushing portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose, but each other. Their history is devastating to see, but is ultimately important for people to see. It's one of those movies where the characters are pretty much like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this film is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see pedestrians in this movie treating them as dirt, especially if we were one of those people at some point. However, the film doesn't try to blame you. Instead, it shows the hard side of lifestyle hustling. It's not a comfortable and whimsical lifestyle that many Hollywood movies portray it as MILK MONEY and FUNNY WOMEN. The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, cruel and ugly life, and it is sad that people have deteriorated as Joe's character in this movie does. What best interests me most about this movie was that it came out in 1969 and it has been perfect for the time being. Today's audience will still find great importance in this movie and will still love it and appreciate it as much as critics and audiences did throughout 1969. The film was rated X, but what I notice about this movie is that sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how humorous, awkward and scary as hell it can be, and this movie is not shy of any of it. The sex in this movie may not be as graphic as it once was. Films classified as X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Greetings, LAST TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT all seem to be pretty tame compared to the shocking things people can get away with an R rating today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong, but they are certainly not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that is what people should keep in mind when watching this movie. The course language used in the film, especially the word "subject" is used effectively and is not free. The violence is very shocking to see even today, but again it is necessary to plot to portray the world of a hustler. I am really pleased to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and still affects as it was in 1969, if not more. I cannot recommend this classic enough, and I hope it continues to find an audience because it is truly a very special and unforgettable experience that will soon not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to see. They have never played roles like before or after, and they are quite different from the usual. You will forget who is playing them within minutes! <br /> <br /> - Great result <br /> <br /> Not at all dated or campy as many movies of the decade come out as today <br /> <br /> - Fantastic and fast editing job <br /> <br /> CONS: <br /> <br /> -Only mature audiences <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well done, but they could only be slightly stronger.
