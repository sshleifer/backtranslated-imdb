Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We expected a light hearted comedy, but got a full blown action movie with comics. We both thought this movie might not have done so well at the box office as the previews made us think it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supportive actors and of course Dave Morse always puts on a great play. Most of the supporters are veterans not first timers and they were solid. We both felt that the writing and the direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie. If you do not buy rent it for a good time.
