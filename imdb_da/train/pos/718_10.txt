Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so amazing was because of The Ramones! You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols, or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just wouldn't have been the same. The youngsters, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the Hallmonterne, just added to the movie. The whole movie is all about The Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of real PUNK. Not the sissy new crap ... but the high and fast kind. Only that kind of Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
