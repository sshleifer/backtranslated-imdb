Me and my sister use to rent this every time we have movies and our parents get so tired of it (but they still let us in) and I love it ... I can't find anyone living near me who know what I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find this on DVD somewhere !! I would love to see this now just bc I loved it as much as a toddler ... and I'm 15 now !!! I remember so much about it ... it was where I got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl got there by sliding down the picture on her little playground
