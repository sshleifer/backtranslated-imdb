Gus Van Sant has made some great films. I'm really a fan. But I can't help but feel that the brain edge of Tom Robbin's book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talents. In the end, even though this one did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or that the plot and content did not come to life. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when we read a book like this. We are taken away to another time and place, and we sometimes think the worst and / or the best, and it adds to the overall runways in the book as it unfolds nicely from the author's precision. However, movies can leave one with less of the imagination and feeling roller-coaster detract from the overall experience. I think that happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
