Nice, comfortable and fun, but not earthquake. It does a good job of showing "behind the scenes" the world of theater groups and the lives of the actors. The three witches are large - both on and off the stage. I would assume that the movie works wonderfully (many apparently within jokes) if you were involved in theater (which I am not).
