Drunk with symbolism and filled with wonderful filmography, Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all expected. This is almost a silent movie, with which dialogue is in German, and much simplified German on it. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a small high school Deutsch can easily renounce the subtitles. Still, the story is of little importance, with the film subsequently on a film level, not a narrative. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human figures - there are even scenes where flowers cover the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments here that resemble the viewers of the works Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it is political: the bourgeois man is thin and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive being; and woman is the creator who is destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma does not overwhelm the film in any way - it is a beauty to see from the beginning to the end - but it places it in a very clear artistic era. And oh yes, Hedy gets her kit off.
