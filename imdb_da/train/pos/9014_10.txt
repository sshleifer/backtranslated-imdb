Shamefully, before I saw this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to assure myself that she was not actually hit, as was her character with (well?) what she was suffering from. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. She pulled it flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually explicit relationships involving the final wants and needs of a unique young lady could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be when the right artists present them in the right way as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the most beautiful creature ever to adorn our earth's face, but she seemed to have made herself in this movie. I hope any of you who see this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
