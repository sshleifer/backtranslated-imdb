I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. It is true that Frank Sinatra does not get the chance to sing so much in this movie, but it is also good that it is not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it is mostly him who makes the song. I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice when he has the voice that suits and I couldn't see anyone with that big voice pulling the gangster feeling out of his voice. Stubby Kayes "Sit down, you are the Rockin 'boats" is a foot-tappin', one-long, that I just love. He is a tough act to follow with his version and I still like his best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and "Adelaide's pat" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Perhaps I would not first consider her, but after seeing her in the part, it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it was resumed in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I find that there is often something lost from the scene version to the movie version, but it kept the scene for the stage, even if it was on film. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well thrown. I performed in regional versions of this and it is one of my favorites during that time.
