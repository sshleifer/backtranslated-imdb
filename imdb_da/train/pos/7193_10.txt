God! Zorro has been the subject of about as many films as Tarzan, and probably had about as many players in the title role. <br /> <br /> One of my own personal favorites, this Serial is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials. Oddly enough, this is a production that came out in the water caste in 1939. * At the time of this production in '39, Zorro was really known as a (Pulp) literary and film character. The film opens with a small footnote on the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom from the rule of a European monarchy, Spain. The story invites for comparison with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> History focuses its attention on the mythical province of San Mendelito and its 'Council'. It is being dealt with by Benito Juarez ** on their gold mines relative to the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must come to Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Onkel to Diego Vega says he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys. A dew from the Don del Oro mob, catching an "insult" to himself and challenging Don Francisco to a duel with swords, Don Frasncisco gets through. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the dark-clad masked sword joint appears to swear battle and after carving the mark "Z" on the bad guy's face, he sends him to the next. Don Francisco declares with his dying spirit to his congregation Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his Los Angeles nephew. He also tries to tell about the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before he declares. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception to Diego in Don Francisco's Hacienda, where Diego disappointed Ramon'sister (also the Don Francisco department) with his crooked action. "FOP !!" she declares. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon release to attend a volunteer meeting. When they ask, "Who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares "Zorro, we are Zorro's Fighting Legion!" Now there is a big battle with the legion, now all dressed in gray, with masks and cape that protects the gold tree. Then Zorro seems to be trapped on a man-made avalanche destined for the convoy, when you know the Cliffhanger end of Chapter 1. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot to write to a chapter, but like most other series, the opening is a longer one and has a lot of reason to be added to the story. Let's just say enough to say that there are 11 more good, well-made, action-packed chapters that follow. <br /> <br /> ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION has all the elements that made for top cliffhanger action. We have an unknown evil leader who discovers problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects who really were behind the 'Don del Oro' mask. We had soldiers, renegade white, enemy Indians and the legion. In short, it is safe to say that there is everything you could want and saw some in this series. And besides, they wisely choose not to get the actors to influence any Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> What is here here that makes the ZFL stand out from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ....... First of all, it has a much more detailed and exciting musical score that plays and emphasizes drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition on the Cantina in Chapter 1. This is probably the only time that such highly specialized innovation appears in serial soundtracks. <br /> <br /> And yet, there's another feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga in front of everyone else. That is, the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but it also sports Lyrics, yes, Legionaires are singing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It works really well and adds to the feelings we get from the view. <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local TV (circa 1955), the entire band immediately recognized Reed Hadley's voice as belonging to 'RACKET SQUAD's Captain Braddock, the TV series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice. *** He also handled the role very well. His costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a slight slip. Some minor anachronism arises from having Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) address the San Mendelito Council when Juarez was about 18 at this time (1824) and although he was later perhaps the greatest individual in Mexico's history, he certainly had not yet achieved such a prominent role. His entry into the story was likely to be redeemed in the release of Warner Brothers' JUAREZ the year that played Paul Muni in the title role. <br /> <br /> This is not just my choice as a top 5 audio series but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great crop of top-flight movies this year, WHAT WILL HAVE WITH THE WIND, MR.SMITH GO TO WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE WIZARD OF OZ, OF MICE AND MEN, ONE MILLION BC, ZENOBIA, WE WANT OUR MUMMY all counted among the production that year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez did not reach any national significance until 1850, about 25 years later. The political subdivisions are also referred to as 'provinces' in history. In fact, they are called "states". Just as we are called the United States, so also south of the border, they call their Republic the United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some very 'A' pictures where his rich toned voice is utilized to a good effect. Look and listen for his story in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
