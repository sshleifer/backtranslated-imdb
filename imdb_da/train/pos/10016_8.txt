If there is one thing to recommend about this movie is that it is exciting. The premise certainly draws the audience in, because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there is advice that there is something dark lurking about. However, there is not much excitement, and Williams' gentle mannered depiction does not do much to make us related to his obsession with the boy. <br /> <br /> Collete fares much better than the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. Production felt rushed and holes are evident. It certainly feels like an example of a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure: Taupin must have written something really good to have inspired at least a commendable effort.
