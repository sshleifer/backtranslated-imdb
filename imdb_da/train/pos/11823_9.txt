I thoroughly enjoyed this true take on Dick Tracy persona. This is a well-made product that used modern technology to create a pictorial cartoon story. If you're a fan of or recently seen some of the old Dick Tracy b & w movies, you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. Pastel colors and larger than life figures reproduced in a meticulously authentic recording at a time gone by are entertainment that is supposed to be. I personally find Madonna's musical element as a big part of this movie. The CD of her music from this movie is one I have listened to often over the years, it is just as well done and performed musically and tuned to the era. Madonna has the finest moment on the screen but especially musical. This is definitely bringing the "baby" into you.
