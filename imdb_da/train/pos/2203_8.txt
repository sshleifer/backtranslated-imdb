I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 and my family always looked at this show. My favorite character was the one that Marion Lorne played as a rather solid, bumbling and very lovable "aunt" type of person. I still remember her "ubba bubba um um" type of commentary as she would try to say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched it was great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I could remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or final credit the "Swedish rapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it playing on my classic radio station here in Southern California, it reminds me of the picture of Mr. Peepers with their back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this picture in my eye is correct.
