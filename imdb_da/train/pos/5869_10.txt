After just watching The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece, the movie Jacknife had big shoes to fill. It has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as is Kathy Baker. but this movie belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a strong, emotional and effective performance.the movie is based on a stage game and there are one or two scenes where it felt obvious to me. of that I just mean that for the two or two scenes I felt I saw a stage play. It wasn't a big deal and didn't really diminish the movie. I really liked this movie. It's not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They are about the same era and have similar themes, but they are two very different films. I thought Deer Hunter was great and I also think this movie was great. It is the actor in this who does it as well. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
