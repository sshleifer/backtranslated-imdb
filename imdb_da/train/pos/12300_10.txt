This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to the back because Garbo had the following in Germany. Garbo himself probably favored her Anna Christie in this version of the English version. It's a good story and a must-see for Garbo fans.
