I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the movie !! What a trip! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! To listen to Darius laughing at being in the water in Panama City to see his fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, he wonders in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the thrill of rafting through some rapids. bet on eating a spoon of wasabi, and the phone rings home and always gets boys boys. This film should be seen by everyone - young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are testament to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; the documented accessibility issues; they took Darius on the journey of his life; And they touched many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
