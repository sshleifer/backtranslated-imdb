One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have figured it out, it is completely different. There are so many phrases in this movie that I have a sore throat from watching. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he may be dependent on leading and in this case writing (with his brother Rick) a good history. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even though they play characters that have all perfected. Dahl seems to bring the best out of people and it will keep you interested and guessing until the end.
