I am totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum and many of the reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is very stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining. I'm glad Ebert and Roeper at least agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie can't be for anyone but if you like over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see it. <br /> <br /> I have previously seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all great movies, but I like this one. It's like a roller coaster, with great soundtrack choices, visual styles and at a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that someone is not afraid to show nudity, violent violence and have an explicit dialogue. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot and even shows nipples in it, either ...
