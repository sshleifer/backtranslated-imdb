I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko has gone halfway through the movie, but the resistance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I did not finally do so in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance adventure in Natal, Nkosi Sikelel 'iArika, my hair stood at its end. There is much to learn from this story for all peoples.
