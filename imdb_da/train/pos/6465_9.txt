This movie, recently voted as the public's favorite at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005, is inspiring and moving. A famous conductor, who is forced to retire on sickness, returns to the small village of his birth to become head of the church choir and finally finds fulfillment in his music. Based on Swedish features of keeping things within themselves and the ecological nature of a small Swedish village, this film develops its own character well. excellently instructed, acted and sung, it brought many eyes to tears and smiles to everyone. Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see it!
