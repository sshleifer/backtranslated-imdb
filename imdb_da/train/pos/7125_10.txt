Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. It's not entirely true to the book, but should it be? No not at all. John Thaw is fascinating as Tom Oakley. His conversion from gruff to care was so well realized, which made it more credible than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, it is Thaw's finest hour. He was severely matched by a young Nick Robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuated traumatized by the violent relationship with his mother. The writing and the music made it worth buying and you can also see Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene Willie found out of Zak's death, and then tells Tom to tell him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina. Buy this, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
