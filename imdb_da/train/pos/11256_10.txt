Without a doubt, the best of the novel John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' royal father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British Controller) along with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural, it should be responsible for casting them. Even the small parts, like Major Membury, are perfected. It says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite Magnus's duality, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer from US Intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times and watch movies almost as many times and continue to be fascinated by both. If I had a book to go on a desert island, a perfect spy would be the choice of everyone else.
