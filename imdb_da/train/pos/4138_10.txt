Another reason to watch this lovely movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? It was my first reaction when the opening credits ran on the screen. I quickly found out who Florence Rice was, a real beauty that becomes a simply wonderful achievement. As they all do in this poignant ensemble piece. From 1939 it is another time, but the charm lies. It transports you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy, but becomes so serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely lovely, at the same time strong, vulnerable, who develops from a girl to a woman. See her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty films, and I have to find the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of Flynn / Gable mode and shows a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel give some good comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30s / 40s movies, Don't Miss This!
