I was happy to see Jim Carrey in a movie where it wasn't the goal to be over the top. His character is like us all. Want more - better things to happen to us and expect God to deliver. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a true sense of love for each of us ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself. I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a bit too vulnerable and understanding to Carry's basic self-centered TV anchor would be, but that's how it is written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews destroyed several potentially very fun scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened. /> <br /> I've read a number of reviews and it seems that some people look a bit too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the world's problems, although there are some messages we can all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A fun movie.
