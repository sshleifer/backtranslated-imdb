This was a very daring movie for his day. It can even be described as soft core porn for the silent era. It was a talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. You needed it anyway. <br /> <br /> The young (19) Hedy Lamarr gets caught in a loving marriage with an obsessive (stereotype) German and after a short time in a marriage that apparently never was completed, returns to his father. <br /> <br /> On a famous and fun scene, she decides to go thin dip one morning when the horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run over a field chasing after it as she left her clothes on the horse. An engineer picks up the horse and returns her clothes - after having noticed. <br /> <br /> For a while, and for a moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. This is where she remembers her honeymoon and her husband and insect actions. She knows this man is different. She returns home and eventually seeks our young guy and finds ecstasy she was denied. You can use your performance here, but his head disappears from view and we see her angry with joy. When he was never undressed, one could imagine ... Certainly a tribute to women by director Gustav Machat√Ω, and a shock to the 1933 audience. <br /> <br /> The only thing that Mars this beautifully recorded movie is excessive guilt and a strange ending.
