I'm not sure this comment contains a real spoiler, but I play it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and so do everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent much of my working life in the cinema, without being an actor. Such people are the gentlemen's heroes in this movie: gaffers, pullers, air directors, lighters and writers, costume people, etc. Etc. And all is said from their point of view, at least to a great extent. Most actors are nuts and self-absorbed at the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you must have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is the drama of reality! Possible spoiler warning: In a big scene, the two leaders, both actors discuss how to discuss something personal, something completely out of the script, with another actor, and they start making lines, practicing and criticizing each other's performance. When this movie appeared, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on television. But almost no one has done so well.
