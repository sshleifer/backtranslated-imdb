I really enjoyed the pilot, it was just as amazing as I hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a rebellion, although I first thought that I would not be able to stand out. Him and Megyn Price A little chemistry at all, but hopefully as the season progresses, they become more comfortable around each other. It must have been strange for Megyn to go from being the star of her last show "" Grounded For Life "to being co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson are brand new to the entire Sitcom scene, but I think in time they are getting better. David Spade's character, to my surprise, was not the focus of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else I've ever seen on television, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all doubts and battles and doubt your decisions that this show is about. All the situations in which the characters are put in just feel like real life, not sugar-coated like most shows. I hope for all the actors that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series if you have just given chance and time.
