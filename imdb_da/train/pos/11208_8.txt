Oh, where are you going, my little one, the little one ... <br/> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations for rocket science. I saw that history, science and humor were interwoven in an exciting story about opportunities. It was 50 years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what a treasure they are. I saw them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who initially did not even enter the room, but later changed when she saw that they were partially animated. When she looked at me, I looked at her, and in the end she was almost as excited as I had been. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young wife with your own kids ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions of reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I thought my daughter's teacher might show them to his class, not just as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as fun and easy-to-understand lessons in history. <br/> <br /> Turn around, turn around, turn over and over ... you wonder how much has really changed in 50 years.
