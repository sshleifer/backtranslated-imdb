I agree with "Jerry." It is a very underestimated space movie (of course, how many good low budgets are NOT undervalued?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a kind of variation (but not "rip-off") in 2001, because the computer controlling the spacecraft In fact, had been a man who had somehow become a computer. And like HAL, they tried to interrupt their "mind", but not the mechanical parts of him, and who with HAL led it to disaster. There is at least one fun moment. When the Christopher Cary character, who cannot find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there is a kind of vicious moment, but it does not happen obviously, after all.
