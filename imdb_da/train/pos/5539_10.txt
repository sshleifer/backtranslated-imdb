When I watched this movie for the first time, it was a wallpaper copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still own the tape and I admit I've seen it more than once from start to finish! The movie is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally entertaining! I've got some of my friends to see this, and we've had some good laughs from the horrible script. The film relates to a couple (remember, it's like the early 70s, so they're just for hip man!) Who goes on a weekend trip in what I mean should be upstate NY. They have a fun dialogue after catching and eating a fish, and the girl notices the death of the fish and that they ate it! The guy comes back with something greasy about how they ate the fish, and now it was part of them and he goes; "And it's a beautiful man!" Heavy man, really heavy! LAUGH OUT LOUD! Anyway, along comes a few Vietnam vets, one of which plays the whistle, I think. (At least they are musical fellows!) The boys are clearly attracted to the girl, and when the couple turns out unfriendly, they are terrorizing them at night. The guy ends up in the cage in a chicken cup and has to see his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. In fact, at the end of the night she seems to be beautiful in it, and when the morning comes, the boys and the girl and the guy are free to leave. Probably the guy has learned a lesson on how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this movie a lot to anyone looking for a marvelous good laugh! It never fails to entertain me anyway! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I would actually buy it again, it's classic camp! You must love these things!
