An American in Paris is an integrated musical, which means that the songs and dancers fit perfectly with the story. The film was inspired by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral composition. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is mixed with show-stop dance tracks choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to popular Gershwin melodies. Songs and music include "I Got Rhythm", "It's Wonderful" and "Our Love is Here to Stay". It set a new standard for subgenre known as "songbook" musical with dozens of Gershwin tunes buried under the underline. Climaxet is "The American in Paris" ballet, an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron set to Gershwin's An American in Paris, with an impressionistic period dream of a different painter's style, one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any Hollywood movie. The ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars, a staggering sum at that time. It is fun to think that such a work of art is born over a pool game between film producer Arthur Freed (Singing 'In REGEN, MEETING ON OZ, AT THE CITY, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS AND BANDVAGEN) and Ira Gershwin. It was Freed's idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about Paris and Gershwin's idea that it would only use Gershwin music. <br /> <br /> Original cast was to have Cyd Charisse, but she discovered she was pregnant before enrollment began. One big reason, Gene Kelly, suggested Leslie Caron when the female leader was because he felt this movie needed a "real" French girl who played Lise, not just an American actress who played one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while on vacation in Paris, where he saw her performing in a ballet. When she got the call to audition, she said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her initial dance sequence, which contained a seductive dance chair, was considered suggestive by some censors. Gene Kelly briefed the short fantasy dance sequences that Lise introduced. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in Georges Gu√©tary and Celeste Holm in Nina Foch. <Br /> <br /> Minnelli was a groundbreaking instructor of musicals with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), an American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used color and songs in ways they hadn't been used before. He used space and time imaginatively. But best of all, he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences ending all his films. The ballet in an American in Paris may be his best work. Although Vincente Minnelli is credited as the sole director, he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from Judy Garland and other direct projects that left Kelly to take over the directives. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Gueter's "Stairway to Paradise" release; Oscar Levant's imagination of performing and performing Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (see why it was Oscar Levant's favorite.) <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now that we know it was successful, everyone will now have the credit for it Freed, Minnelli, Kelly ?? But before the film was completed, the New York office for MGM said no to spend half a million dollars on a ballet. So Friday went to studio head Louis B. Mayer himself and made him agree, New York said no. Finally, did the Gene Kelly New York office show how a British movie THE RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence and that the movie became a worldwide hit ?? and still considered today as a good example of a successful art film. Now the economic guys finally gave in and signed the check. <br /> <br /> There was a break in production after November 1, 1950, when Gen Kelly began practicing ballet choreography. When the production for the last sequence resumed on December 6, Vincente Minnelli finished another movie - Father's Little Dividend (1951). Irene Sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sets that reflect various French impressionist painters: 'Raoul Dufy', Edouard Manet (flower market), Maurice Utrillo (a Paris street), Henri Rousseau (fair), 'Vincent Van Gogh' 'Opera ) and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (Moulin Rouge). Wallpapers took six weeks to build with 30 painters working nonstop. Roger Ebert said after seeing the recent restoration: "An American in Paris has many qualities, not least its famous ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole story of their marriage proposal." An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN ' IN THE RAIN, as it is the greatest musical ever made, and a critic has the best when he said, "THE SINGLE IN THE RAIN makes me happy, and an American in Paris makes me feel good." The ballet represents Kelly's fantasies as depicted by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) he admires. Arranges a screening for the then unhappy Raoul Dufy, the actor and the producer to the final credits. There was relief, they found the artist, moved to tears and asked for another help for the lavish finale. <br /> <br /> The movie was also the first to win a Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture (comedy or musical.) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly received an honorary award for that year for "his versatility as an actor, singer, instructor and dancer, and especially for his brilliant performances in choreographic art on film. " It was his only Oscar.
