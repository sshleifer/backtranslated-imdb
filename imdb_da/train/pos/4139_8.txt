I really wonder how this show plays in the US and the rest of Europe. IT IS SO SELF-RELATING THAT IT IS AN AMERICAN (especially white Americans). It can be a major cause of some of the poison and vitriol expressed here on this board. I love the show but it is with some reservations and I feel it took the easy way out of Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Scratch and burn everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door down on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of a yard. Who knows? It was a fun, raunchy and sometimes, somewhat scary show.
