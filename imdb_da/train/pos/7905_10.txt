I feel very upset about people going to movies with a pillow and pencil to write mistakes and keep track of how bad a movie is. I just feel disdain for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and / or enjoy 90 minutes of aways from their boring or busy lives! Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, it is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to look like the book in some way, it's not for you. But if you enjoyed the full hilarity of the Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or "what the hell do I see" by the Moulin Rouge. Or the brutal comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" Then let yourself escape to the Cowgirls. It has some really fun parts. Hilarious indeed. It also has some really good music; kudos to kd.lang. Also I mention it has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... should I say more?
