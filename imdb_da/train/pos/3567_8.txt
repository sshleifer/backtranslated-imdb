Damon Runyon's world of Times Square, in New York, before his Disneyfication, is the foundation of this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about movies, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "world's intersection", which shows us the lower part of New York from the past. Frank Louise's music sounds good. We see a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area. People on the community's side tend to hover toward this area because of the lights, the action, the opportunities in that part of the city. This underbelly in town lived out of the street life that was so intense. <br /> <br /> Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the movie. We don't know if that makes sense, but it's not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and change what worked on stage. The original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we wonder the decision not to let Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These were prominent actors who could have made a fantastic contribution. <br /> <br /> The film, visually, is amazing. The look closely follows the times of the ages. As for the casting of Marlon Brando, who is otherwise not known for his singing friends, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, seems to work in the film. Sky Masterson is after all a man's man who would see different sissy if he presented another 'look'. Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a good job showing the Salvation Army woman who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to rescue. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a pleasure. She never ceases to amaze like Miss Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold, who is Nathan Detroit's love interest. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl, who is wiser than she lets be. Stubby Kaye does a wonderful job based on rendering his nicely nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The wonderful production owes much to the talented Abe Burrows who made the adjustment to the screen. Costumes from Irene Sharaff set the right tone.
