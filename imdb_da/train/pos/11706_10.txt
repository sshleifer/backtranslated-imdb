For all reviewers on this site, I have to say that this movie is worth seeing. So it was made in 1972, so what. The fashion of the movie was exactly the same way in its time. People who did not study culture in the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, 'Left Behind' (which is made for our time right now) it seems to be cheezy. However, the only cheezy part of the movie is fashion, which again was over 30 years earlier. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is just so much to say, but I refuse to say so. (for fear of spoiling it) Then go out and watch this movie! If you don't like the message it sends you have problems that need some attention!
