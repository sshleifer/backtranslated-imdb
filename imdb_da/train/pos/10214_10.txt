For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies with no idea what will happen, so I think many of the other reviews here in this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie again and I have to repeat that it has the best end to any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The real translation, "The Butterfly's Wings' battle, is not used as the translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what Chaos Theory is (except those who saw or read" Jurassic Park ") The movie is based on chaos theory and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly independent events that all lead back to an event, the film being a whirlwind of wonderful cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it entangles between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending. Think of yourself, "what else should be said?" Too bad we have to go abroad for a gem like this, but one end like this would never come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
