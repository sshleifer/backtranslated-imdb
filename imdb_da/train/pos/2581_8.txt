People are too hard on the movie. Sometimes we just have to sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "review" it. <br /> <br /> It all comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his goal still goes down. Then begins the fun, as everyone around him also goes down. Just think JFK and all the people who are in any way associated with his murder whose lives ended abruptly and in dubious ways, and you will appreciate what is implied in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what might have happened. Though the EXACT story line I have not been followed (review here after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), it is what is implied that it is interesting. I'd like a copy of it to see it again. In light of what is known today, the Domino principle is straightforward.
