Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is huge. His legacy is an excellent group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with "The Shop Around the Corner". This film has been transformed into other less prominent films and a musical game without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own and specific version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together in several films. Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie, without almost appearing to be acting. Both stars are lovely as penpals who do not know each other, but who fate had them working together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic movies worked so well is great support for studios put together in picture by picture. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan who plays the shop owner. We also see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work to make us believe that yes, they are in Budapest. That's why these movies will live forever!
