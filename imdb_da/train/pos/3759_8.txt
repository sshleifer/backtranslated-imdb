Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are getting close to rock stars in the future but still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in the popular public history, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is set to kill Bill & Ted by sending cyborg look-likes to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent to today's present and they actually kill the real Bill & Ted. Now both boys are spirits and they have to travel through the sky and hell to save themselves and their future. Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made a smart sequel with amazing visual effects. Much more fun and entertaining than the original. William Sadler steals the show as The Grim Reaper. DVD has a good anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer and a nice Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the theatrical trailer and an entertaining behind stage featurette. This successor was a Box Office hit as the original, but it is also (Believe it or not), one of the best successors ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin represents his role from the original card. Pam Grier also looks in a small role. It's a fun fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
