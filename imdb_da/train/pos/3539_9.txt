Good: Engaging movie fire, good presentation, vehicles are fun to drive, pretty appealing multiplayer, true to the movie, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Poor: Main tasks are a little short. <Br /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter (not necessarily a spy game) is. Great fire fighting continues the story and makes you complete every mission through and unlock all the real bonuses the game has to offer. The hype this game had lived up to, and I personally think you should buy it and join a couple of friends and play it. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound of this game is a rip-roaring performance from a couple of previous bond games and firing a weapon, really feeling like you're shooting a weapon. It is related to the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. All in all, this game makes you excited and contented after you complete it and some multiplayer games that can compete with the standards of the horrible James Bond "Nightfire" gamecube game.
