I just watched this episode tonight on a newly added presentation of one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes every day. As the gentleman stated in the other previous comment here, I agree that this may not have been one of the best programs in the series, but I find it entertaining anyway. My father was a friend of one of the main characters (in my home town of Cincinnati) for whom young Rod Serling had worked in the media there - and I remember Father telling how talented and creative he was remembered there. Overall, the "Twilight Zone" is definitely one of the true classics of television, and considering its production in the high quality of the Cold War, not only gives a picture of this era in the country but also (today) a nostalgic image of the production techniques, creative views and the actors of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Minor "spoiler." * This particular <br /> <br /> special story, like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, shows a story where locals are supposed to give a "surprise" ending. Sometimes the signs on earth, from other places, while history initially involves at least one is an "Earthling". These usually included the message (as here) of a situation caused by the doomsday buttons, which has finally been pressed by the superpowers in this cold war time. See today stories like this giving a nostalgic look at this worldly point of view 4-5 decades ago and still giving some food to thoughts. - Like this episode. Although the dialogue may not have spanned the significant talents of the leaders, it still presents a simple, important message and a valuable 20-minute minutes of entertainment and interest.
