Really fantastic movies, the concept of a possible prophetic vision of the future is scary. A world of overpopulated, unbearable heat because of the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources used. In this nightmare degenerate society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a sympathetic film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, unlike film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance. <br /> <br /> One of the photos that will always be with me from this movie is the masses of people who fill the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) jumps through them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The use of music by the film is also worthy of note, although it does not contain any scores in the usual sense. The opening theme is good, and the subsequent muscles we here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic, are excellently atmospheric.
