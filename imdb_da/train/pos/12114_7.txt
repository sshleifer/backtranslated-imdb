This film is of course low budget and recorded in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to overcome to make this movie compelling (seen in California and the late 60s and 80s) were well thought out. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of Vallejo & Bay from 1968-19? (he was never caught). Edward James Olmos (The Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac at the time considered to be Arthur Leigh Allen, since cleared of DNA & fingerprints) play a game of cat and mouse. Visit scenes together, each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation. Ommos dies of some kind of terminal illness and knew Dzundza did it, still completely obsessed with losing his family and becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way. totally ignorant and self-absorbed (like all serial killers) to the carnage in his wake. The only disappointment was "over the top" which otherwise ended up quite accurate. If you are tired of the typical Hollywood fluff or are interested in the Zodiac case, check it out.
