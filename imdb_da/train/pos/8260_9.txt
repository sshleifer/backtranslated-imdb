The French and Germans probably have a long story that doesn't like each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would besiege Germany and start its plans to take over the world, where France is a loss of ambition. But these are times of serenity in relation to the future. A group of miners at the border are trying to cross to France for work. They are asked back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then there is a catastrophe in the French mines and a well-marked and written scene, a troop of German miners deciding to come to the rescue. A simple story isn't it? Pabst was the poet of silent cinema, and I'm not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He is not pushy, but brings a robust realism to the trial. Ther is even a backlink to another world war event waving the point in this story. Presumably based on a true event, the film makes the events proud of directness and solemnity. Smetimes, that's what a movie should be.
