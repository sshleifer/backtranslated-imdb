this movie should be seen. The truest picture of what's going on in the world I've seen since Darwin's nightmare. Go see it! And if you're lucky enough to get it open in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to get through, but hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is great and the rest of the casting is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this movie, and I think he should spend some of his own money to do it. It's a wild, absurd trip, of course, made without the resources it needs, but it still succeeds. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher has not shown the courage to say what this film is saying.
