While the "Spider Woman's Kiss" threw Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, he is now working for a dictator in a fictitious Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaces the electric president with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who shoots a movie in the country. Then, Dreyfuss must find out how to be a dictator, constantly balancing it with his own life. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with it. Whatever they do in this movie, they pull it out. It just shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the biggest players in our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth a look. Also starring Sonia Braga (who starred with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is warm.
