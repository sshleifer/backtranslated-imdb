Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was terribly abused as a little boy by his monstrous, violent, alcoholic stiff Barry (a real scary depiction of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fiance (sweetly played by the lovely Tracee Newberry) and a job that transcribes autopsy reports in a local morning. Haunted by his bleak past, the egg of the bald, brilliant Jack demon (a really scary Michael Robert Brandon) and sent over the edge at his mother's recent death, Eric goes out of the deep end and goes on a brutal killing amok. Capably controlled by Kallio (who also wrote the tight, sharp scripts) with the uniform effect of a non-name sound (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as Eric's wannabe helpful host's angel Michael), rather hard but overall polished filmography by George Lieber , trustworthy true to life figures, frightening outbursts of raw, shocking and unintentional violence, a mood, spooky score of Dan Kolton, an uncompromising downward ending, grungy Detroit, Michigan sites, a grimly serious tone and a tight, poignant tale that remains On a stable track throughout this extremely powerful and gritty psychological horror thriller makes it often absorb and disturb viewing. A real sleeper.
