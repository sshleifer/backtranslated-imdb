There are very few movies that are as fun as this one. I was fortunate enough to watch this movie at a theater "reserved" for movie buffs like me so it wasn't so embarrassing to sit there laughing until my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet to dry my eyes. .. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but it is perhaps the best thing - a little rest in between the role of the aisles (I almost fell out of the seat ...) was very welcome.
