I originally encountered Linda Fefermans seven minutes in heaven when I was 14 and worked in a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized it was a lost treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, nearly twenty years before she would continue to win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a milder, shorter and softer version of Pretty in Pink's and Some Kind of Wonderful's from the 1980s, which is precisely why it is so good. It is honest, not forced like the movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with children there. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father goes home on business, Jeff convinces him to move in because his homeland stinks. With support from Natalie's friend, Polly, played beautifully by Maddie Corman, she lets him down. But this movie is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can get away with. The three leaders are so natural, and the manuscript is surprisingly so honest that what comes best in their performances is heartbreaking. These characters are really interested in each other. It's a great movie to show to children who reach their adolescence. <br /> <br />
