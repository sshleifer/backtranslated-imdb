I think it's a great version I came here before to help me figure out which version I should use, and I went to Jane Eyre in 1983 and read a comment from the users and then helped me get this version. I'm not sorry to choose this version, nor will you. I tried to see all the other versions and nobody matched it. There is nothing like the book and TRUST ME, if you read the book, you want something that fits it. When you're looking for something right and moving after you've read the book, it's hard because you want something that fits it. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It points to true love for a human being. I want to say that God's love is greater. If there's anything better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no one like that!
