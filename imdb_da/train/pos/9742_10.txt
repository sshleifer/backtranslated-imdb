This outstanding Argentinian independent film is one of the very best of 2000 from all over South America, including Argentina, producing an amazing number of quality films since 1999. In 2000, Argentina published many quality films that broke Argentine B.O. records. Half a dozen were internationally recognized as being here at important world film festivals. After watching this movie, one can see how gay Argentine films were able to regain 20% of their national film market last year. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of Argentina's best directors, Daniel Burman, this film explores the effects of globalization around the world, but emphasizes its impact on Argentina, and especially the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the lovely Jewish boy trying to survive and even succeed in today's business environment. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Latin American cinema worldwide, is perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, like the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. <br /> <br /> So many current topics in urban western society are explored, I don't have enough space to go into detail. Daniel Burman weaves them wisely into the plot with various characters that personify different dilemmas. If this movie is playing at a festival near you or on video, don't miss it!
