A couple (Janet and Richard) go camping in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple take shelter in what they think is an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, a few escaped prisoners arise, and after much delay of the inevitable, they continue to rape Janet and lock Richard in a bird cake. <br /> <br /> This last house on the left-like movie must be one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. It is one of the more sick and wobbly early 70s shocks. In addition, I found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's wrong tone. I love CAGED TERROR. The music definitely helps to give a sense of personality to the movie as well as a lot of beauty. I found the movie to be absolutely scary. The errors are mainly related to the film's pacing, that is, the film is rather slow and wobbly. While I didn't mind pacing because of the beauty and excitement of that movie, I think it will be most. The action is not too good nor the dialogue, at least in the early stages. This movie takes a little more patience than usual, and it really is not for everyone. <br /> In short, it was a good movie. Not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly a lot of fun. It's not exactly the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find it in the used section of many stores if you look hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the trash, it's definitely worth checking out.
