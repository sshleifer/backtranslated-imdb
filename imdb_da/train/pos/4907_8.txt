A well-designed and imaginative production, refreshingly free of clich√©, tells this somewhat figurative affair a narrative of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions: The man condemned escaped, kidnapping the youth to his worth like hostages. Alan Gibson, experimented with a good sense of balanced narrative movement, gives the film freshness in almost every scene, such as felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of parole was particularly undeserved, designed a marvelous, but In the end, successful flight plan, after which his spontaneous nature emerges in the future as he flies to his childhood seas. Frequently, singing or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gets his prisoner's trust and love, and as the police are closing in for an inevitable inventory, the cohesive couple is seen as a large part of their response to forms of rejection depicted by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) responsible for manhunt for Steckert and his "prisoner". This is an exciting story, worth telling, a quick and new adventure that deserves a capital performance from Harris, fine twists from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black along with Justin Henry as it snatched let with an appropriate spinning score contributed by Wilfred Josephs and top-notch filmography by Frank Watts, with all footage shot in a beautiful autumn man Ontario province.
