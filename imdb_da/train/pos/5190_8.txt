The benefits of this movie are the amazing combat situations - amazing sword movements and martial arts show. A real John Woo masterpiece. The story, however, tends to be a little week, but it never overshadows the overwhelming view of acrobatic martial arts. If you're into martial arts movies, you'll love this one!
