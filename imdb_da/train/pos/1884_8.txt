This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to reject his hero's uninspiring lifestyle, but taken for what it is worth and not as trivializing alcoholism, the movie is simply a lot of fun. It tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk, irresponsible 40 bachelor named Arthur, who is willing to inherit a great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks she can do anything about him. Arthur suggests, but then it falls uncertainly to Linda, a waitress and petty thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the world's most intoxicating drunk whose antics are a laugh for a moment. Admittedly, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her on screen chemistry with Moore is amazing. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> But this movie is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, depicting Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. Obviously, these two have had a great joint affection during Hobson's long-standing employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting aspect of this movie is not Arthur's romance at all, but his unusual report with this witty and, of course, dishonest servant. It is butler you will remember best long after the final circuit.
