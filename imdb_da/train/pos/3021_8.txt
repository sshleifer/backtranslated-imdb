but it is worth looking at for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainment, filmed during the war, required either transplantation to US shores, as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they didn't fit. Bacall fits the part here. I waited for her to flute and bring Bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply wrong for an English teacher's upper class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not speak that way except in books, but Greene sent a message about an England to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range was kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee looked more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality was held, and his last conversation with Paxinou is invaluable.
