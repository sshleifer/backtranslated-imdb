A great British indy movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters makes for some hilarious fabric-driven pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (though he has changed pages since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! Loved the final battle scene with the nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set fire to Top of the Pops! ... he doesn't work .... he's really a bona fide british hippie !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy this and it is right into my Friday night after the pub repeat show collection. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a ride and you won't be disappointed.
