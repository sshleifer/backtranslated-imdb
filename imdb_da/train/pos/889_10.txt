This is one of the best Hong Kong (action) movies around, and it has an exciting and exciting history as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero too. It's the only martial arts movie that got me interested in the plot instead of just waiting for the games. Sammo fans - This is a must see (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao's Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter Fat Dragon.
