I searched for this movie for years, apparently it is not available here in the states, so I bought myself a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends are waiting in the woods, looking for a bear that apparently killed several campers. What they find is a veterinarian from Vietnam who has gone crazy (he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal fingernails a la Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a short argument with her girlfriend, she is killed. When one of the groups finds their body, they all store in their tent and wait for daylight. When the sun comes up, everyone tries and makes it out, but the victim falls one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not very much, but a few good murders, especially the girls' deaths. The boys are killed in some bloodless ways (blown by car, shot to death, knife through head). <br /> <br /> All in all, INFERNAL TRAP is a great slasher movie from the late 80's. Nothing new, just well-acted, fast and some beautiful ladies. 10 out of 10
