This movie was an impressive one. My first experience with a foreign film, it was neither too long nor too complex. I've even had the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and outdated brother after a long separation, seemed first and foremost to climb, but it turned out to be very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor not to push or drill the audience.
