Superb cast, more thanks! <br /> <br /> If you can capture almost anything else written by Plater (or starring in these amazing actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a true sense of jazz, my recommendation is to see the "Beiderbecke" trilogy at any time. <br /> <br /> "There are three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and" What time does the tune begin?
