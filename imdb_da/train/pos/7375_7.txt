Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese crap. I wish that North American horror producers would take a page out of the Japanese horror template and put more "spookiness" and less cheap shocks into their flicks. Lots of good examples in this scene where a white face is the scene staring behind a young actress, photographs on a wall suddenly flashed smiling, just for a second and more. Well worth checking out if you like the genre.
