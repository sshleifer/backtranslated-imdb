This movie changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hip hop but had never seen it professionally done (hi I was an 11 year old kid from Holland!) When I watched this movie, all this changed. I became actively involved in the hip hop movement in our city, started to breakdancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still consider this movie to be a personal favorite. Sure, the movie and "cinematographic" meaning may not be as significant. But who cares about the big shot being filmed badly or if you could see a microphone hanging over someone? That's what it does for you personally that counts ...
