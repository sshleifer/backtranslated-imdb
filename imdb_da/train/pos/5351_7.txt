Although this movie is something filled with eighties cheese, I have a place for it in my DVD rack and I don't know why. I think I like it because history's morality is 'television is garbage, so turn it off and go and get a life'. For those of you who decide to respect the message, try reading the book, it's not like the movie at all. To destroy it for you at the end of the story, a badly wounded Richards ends up throwing a plane into the network building and killing himself, all inside and closing the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be hard not to compare it with 9/11.
