After a long hard week behind the desk, all those pond serious decisions make this movie a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this movie will take you away to a land of strange humor and sci-fi paradise. 'Captain Zippo died in Buick's great accusation. He was a brave man. 'Jack Nicholson's impression shines right through the alien face with the dark sunglasses and the leather jacket. And always beware of the 'donut of death!' Remember the first rule in this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'Prepare to die earthly!' You just have to see it yourself.
