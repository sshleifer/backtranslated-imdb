This movie will go down in history as one of the big ones, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On the Waterfront. Someone will convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo not seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil that comes from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you chills. Dingman's character as buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the highlight. My goodness, climax. I will not spoil it for you, but it makes the explosion of Death Star pale in comparison. If you can track this hard to find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I still hope for a special edition DVD one of those days.
