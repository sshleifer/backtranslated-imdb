Pandro S. Berman was "at the expense of production", but it made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, not recorded in Arizona, but in California's Mohave desert, where scares have struck off all the remnants of the "gold temple", the Thuggee cabins, the British outpost in Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. minor technical errors can and must be forgiven. What is inexcusable is the lack of an Oscar for the best music, although the Academy might not have offered it at that time. A single theme was played in different tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. An actor playing Kipling appears shortly before and after the battle scene. In the original release, his scenes were cut, per. Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later, they were included and lent a "connection" of Kipling's immortal poems to Ben Hat's manuscript. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who even hated the British.
