I'm sorry to say I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Borrowing a hand is honestly a boring Columbo to me. After a couple of times I get bored and change the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young beautiful wife as Patricia Crowley plays to see if she has an affair. In return, Culp's character christer the cheating wife who plans to postpone his scheme for her husband who destroys his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by beating her face and putting it up in the body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I just don't care about this. Of course, Columbo eventually gets him. It's just the question of how.
