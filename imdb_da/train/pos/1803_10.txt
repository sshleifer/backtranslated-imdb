My dog ​​recently went away and it was a movie I loved as a child so I had to watch it to try to encourage. <br /> <br /> (Beware of dog, I mean Spoilers.) This movie is not It is not just for children and it is far from commonplace. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this movie, but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not so different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, Carface. He is money driven, greedy, and just escaped the death row as he says at the beginning of the function. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and his sidekick, Itchy. Carface won't even listen to the cool, ugly dog ​​with the big glasses closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface is trying to murder the hero because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and will not pay for only 50% - a very unusual way for a German shepherd mix to die. Also eaten by a prehistoric size alligator that ends up saving you because you can sing, is very unlikely whether you are a dog or not. This is a cartoon and therefore it is logical here. Carface's inhibition method is through murder while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, economic success it is. After surviving death, he begins a business by taking Carfall's source of funding, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole lot of races, and Charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor - hints on hints: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor. He spends the money on his casino / bar / theater, and not the other "poor". The reason why Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens carefully. She teaches Charlie's ethics by pointing to his games, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to get by buying her dresses. She added the ethics that his business needed while Charlie did the management, and Itchy provided construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to tear down Charlie's business, which is unprotected by the government. Charlie loses everything and everything he has left is this little girl. Eventually he had to choose between his life and his own. He first takes the watch of self-preservation and puts it down when the girl begins to sink. Both the girl and the clock were declining, and he had to choose which one and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The big part about this movie, focusing on a person's ability to learn from wrong over time and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of their pet's death, is that it never shows someone dying! The clock symbolizes its life, and the clock is shown submerged and stopped. All the deaths were evident, even for the villain. I didn't cry during this movie until now, and I've got so much more out of it that I had to write it down and share it with you.
