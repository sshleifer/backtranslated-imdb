Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside of film festivals. Why? Can your censors stomach a movie where policemen anal rape male and female suspects to get them to talk (and the victims enjoy it) or watch an old lady get her eye torn out of her skull? These are just a few of the bumps present for viewers of this ultraviolet police and gangster's story. That makes Clockwork Orange, which was banned for years in the UK, resembles a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Are you watching this movie? YES It is great and crucial viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goes on in the world of these characters. If you like this, be sure to catch the Dead or Alive, which is very uniform (excluding the crazy ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan, they have a talent that Miike works at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to watch this movie outside of a Takashi Miike retrospect on a film festival is on DVD. If I haven't settled down, try looking for a Hong Kong version on the Internet, as I'm sure it will come out in that country.
