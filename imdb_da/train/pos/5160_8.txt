Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock finds himself trapped in a world past ice age, while Capt. Kirk is in the same planet's colonial era. But it is the former couple who have the most tried time. In addition to the freezing temperatures and sanctuary found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this age, he slowly begins to return to his ancestral behavioral patterns, feeling a natural attraction for Zarabeth, and throwing "caution toward the wind" to ever leave this place. It is only with Dr. McCoy's constant "reminders" that Spock holds true. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few times when the character shows some emotion and Nimoy (Spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking bejesus out of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly to previous submission, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to get the girl, another plus for this. Perennial "old man" Ian Wolfe analyzes the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.
