Fragglerock is excellent in the way that Schindler's list was excellent. A good watch for children and adults of all sex. Large noses can be seen as hinting against false symbols, in the same way as H.R. Puff N Stuff had hinted at marijuana smoking. Your kids will love this movie. I enjoyed it very much as a child. My father showed me this movie as a child. He also enjoyed it well and pointed out that the exaggerated nose was false symbols. Although at that time I had no idea what they were. The movie is comedy and adventure. The story is crazy and cheerful. Me and you should enjoy this together.
