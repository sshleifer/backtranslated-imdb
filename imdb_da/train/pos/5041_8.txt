Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer hunted by the FBI. When agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is actually his death brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life since childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widow, Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God has just visited him and given his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago at VHS, and yesterday I looked again, now on DVD. Although it is a low budget film, the manuscript is sharp, with no errors. The cast is excellent, but I would like to highlight Matt O'Leary's performance as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A big debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand '). If at least it was' the hand of God, it could be acceptable. But calling this movie as "the devil's hand" is actually ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
