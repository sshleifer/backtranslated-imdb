Mary Poppins is certainly much better, but it is a nice movie anyway. Angela Lansbury is great dotty as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just as brilliant. However, the children just lacked the same sparkle, although Paul is very funny and sweet. The songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact, all the songs are excellent. Special effects were wonderful, with lots of magic, and the story is original enough. However, the highlights were, like Mary Poppins, the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the football game, which was absolutely fun. The only other criticism was that I didn't get it finally when I first saw it. All in all, a nice movie, it's almost never on. 8/10 Bethany Cox
