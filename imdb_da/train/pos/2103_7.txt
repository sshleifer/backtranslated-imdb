I'm not familiar with "Largo Winch" as a cartoon (or is it a graphic novel? I really don't know), but I have to admit, hear about an agent / movie I expected something other than what I actually got. <br /> <br /> While it was sensational to see this in the beginning, it was nice to see this feature together. You can never really tell where it would go (some terms are predictable, but generally you can never really say where it will end). A more than star-like performance from the main actor and a really good support cast makes this a comfortable watch. Not as an action pack as some might hope or expect for a movie, but a really good mix.
