This is one of the more fun movies I've seen. it had elements, but they were full of charm. It is the Altmanesque manuscript, brilliant physical humor and laid-back friendships that were a pleasure to see, and a piece of life most of us can relate to. and I can say with some honesty that I was afraid of Steve Carell's nipple .. I was really. It is surprising that this is a good-natured, unimaginable comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we had to find along the way. Catherine Keener was great as Trish, and all Steve Carell's friends were flawed but gracious and so funny. The idea that they thought Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a pine virgin. But the simple truth was that he would fall in love first. original, charming and very fun. highly recommended.
