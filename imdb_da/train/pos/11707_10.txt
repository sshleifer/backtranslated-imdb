I remember watching this movie a long time ago, but since it had no special effects, the play was really good. And it still has the same message today, even though the technology has changed, maybe they should remake this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music from the movie, and Larry Norman was a great songwriter during this time, although now most Christian music is worshiping and praising music. I was always curious to know what ever happened to Patty after the series ended? Did she go on making more movies, did she eventually get married and travel a family? I want an update.
