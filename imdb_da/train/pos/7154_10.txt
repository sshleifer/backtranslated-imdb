I found out about the movie "Holes" by hearing from people that it was not typically Disney that both children and adults both came into the story. People, let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel Louis Sachar and follows the adventures of Stanley Yelnats, a boy being sent to a strange youth prison camp in the desert. He turns to a boy named Zero and together they set out on adventures that change their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and fun story. I didn't quite know what to expect when I saw it. It was interesting to see the story come together as pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the youth abusers were all very funny and Jon Voight was just fun as Mr Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most Recommended!
