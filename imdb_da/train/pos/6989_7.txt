This movie was featured on a very early episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this movie, I am not thinking of the wonderful television series. I think this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and image for a 67-year-old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed seeing Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife, requiring fluid from the glands of adolescents would be brides, an old hag and her two bizarre sons, a giant idiot, the other a comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto from 1932s freaks). I also enjoyed the upscale young female reporter who is a kind of stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is the plot, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I don't want to spoil any of this movie, so go and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a few bucks.
