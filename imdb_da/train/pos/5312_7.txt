Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is the typical "alternative" or indie movie with a plot that has a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera, and his main hobby is to take pictures of the exotic habitats in the small town where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist is aware of his work and hires him to postpone his work at some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life changes drastically, as happiness and fame now seem to confuse the people of Pecker's primary inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets angry because now he doesn't pay the "adequate" attention to her. Now it's an indie film with an edge, but not for everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious to some people, but I still think it's worth watching because it gives something "different" to Hollywood's typical standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: This is the typical Christina Ricci and John Waters movie. That is it. Oh and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are very annoying. Geez.
