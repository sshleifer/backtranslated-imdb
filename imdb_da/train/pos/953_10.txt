Much richer in texture and character than even the classics of the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born as Scrooge, just as he was born to Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Scrooge's character as played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump out of the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust but even more profound Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the best man in the 18th century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, understandable but highly contradictory level; His role was dealt with by the great authority that Scott always brings to the screen: however, his usual bellicose voice will sometimes be whispered, almost like a soliloquy, as he would touch the Christmas holiday in a breath and yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line . He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge and a misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge all in the same scene. Really a remarkable achievement of a giant of his generation.
