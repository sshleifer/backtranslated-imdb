Offbeat, slow-paced, entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult even for them not to appreciate the many imaginative sequences that this movie contains, or to ignore Krabbe's prime performance. Verhoeven maintains an exciting ambivalence throughout the film and plays with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes, it is far too weak, and the unsatisfactory end is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
