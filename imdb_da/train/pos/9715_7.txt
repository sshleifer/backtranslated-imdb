Here is the thin, it seems that this is much older when I thought it was. But it's still cool. Bicycle mechs are cool and history works mostly. There are some character issues that I hope work out of part 2 and my biggest complaint about it being a MACROSS bank. Not just the animation style but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY OF MACROSS. Mechs are similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters. This is really not made for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So to make a long story short, I give this cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.
