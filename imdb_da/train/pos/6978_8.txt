Now I have to say that I have been waiting for it to come. <br /> <br /> I won't try to spoil it, and a lot of people really have brilliant talk about the pilot. On the other hand, I am not quite sure to understand the critics who claim to be BSG fans and not as the pilot. <br /> <br /> What do they expect? !! The background is to set 50 years before BSG we are there and help at Cylon's birth, see life in the Adama family (have we already known some of it from BSG), get a deeper explanation of the caprician population and its perception of the others colonies, and potentially the origin of the god's faith in the human and the unique god faith in the cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same abundance of special effect or space operation as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, although I know Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is 1:30 of promising start, I also think this will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I expect much of the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching the DVD's deleted scene also gives more material to your brain to chew on. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
