I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual fare --- a formal movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave at the end of June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be a laugh after the other. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great "father". <br /> <br /> If you want a comfortable couple of hours, definitely check this out.
