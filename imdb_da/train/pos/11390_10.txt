The story and the music (George Gershwin!) Is wonderful, like the Levant, Guetary, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing and that thing is a good leading lady. Sorry, Leslie Caron is bothering me. In spite of her, the plot moves well with the famous (and deserved) Ballet. Oh the colors, the dazzling reds, the blues, the greens and the yellows. Don't forget beiges too. ; ) I just love the contrast between Beaux Arts Ball (all black and white costumes) and the ever so brilliant ballet. So I guess what I'm trying to say is this: Please, at least see it and enjoy it, because even if it's not the best, it's MARVELOUS. But be sure not to forget the other Gene Kelly musical with the 20 year old girl who was catapulted to the star right afterwards.
