Felt it was very balanced in showing what Jehovah's Witnesses have done to protect American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. I also appreciated how it showed how becoming a Witness affects family members without witness and how difficult it is for them to accept that they are not celebrating holidays, the sad part is that non-witness families do not think about having theirs Witness family over for family dinners / visits or giving them gifts at any time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical treatment, the witnesses expect and expect a high standard of medical care, people forget that blood transfusions allow dormant medical care and operations while bloodless treatments mean that the medical team is highly educated and trained, which you would prefer to treat your loved ones ? I highly recommend this video!
