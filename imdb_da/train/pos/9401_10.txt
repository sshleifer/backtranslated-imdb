What a wonderful movie entitled to so many labels never get: Science fiction, film noir, with a script and dialogue with high intelligence that requires a trained, cultured audience ..... the kind of English language film that only performed in pre-1960 England (and only shown in US art houses when it first arrived), and never ever done in the United States. Main characters in The Man In The White Suit (1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, the science reference as "polymer" and discuss and explain the concepts of chemistry as "long-chain molecules" and then communicate the significance of these to the average man and the benefits that science gives him. The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion movies, which now (2009) dominate the world cinema and certainly dominate major American cinemas ....... it is a meticulously acted, told intelligent story delivered by gifted and trustworthy educated English actors (like talented people), and that's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and irony, which the ancient Greek playwrights would have approved. Everyone should watch this movie, and one day somehow some worthy filmmakers and his followers should make someone else like it. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
