Marjorie, a young woman working in a museum and living with two female roommates, Pat and Terry. One night she goes in her car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The man has his purse. The police cannot help her as the actual rape did not happen. When one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her attacker comes there. His name is Joe. A long fight begins against this man. But then he manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent substances that will kill him if he doesn't get help quickly. She ties him up and makes Joe the same physical and mental assault he used to do in her past. The extremities (1986) are directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial 1982 off-Broadway game by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost his fight with cancer last year, is great as Marjorie. James Russo, who also played the striker in the game, is convincing as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Security Guard. She has a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie to entertain you. It asks a question, is revenge justified. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
