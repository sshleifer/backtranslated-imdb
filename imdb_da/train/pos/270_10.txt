I have to say that seventeen & gaps are much better than expected. The view I took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists on her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss) not attending a so-called graduation party a weeknight, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes anyway for the party. When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something that is wrong and she begins to get visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV films of this type, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this movie and most of it comes out as credible. This LMN Original Movie premiere last night. 10.10
