This is a great movie if seen in the right context - It was supposed to be a parody of teen-horror-devil worship movies (and the 80s so many of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and immediately liked it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And something with OZZY as a metal hating preacher cannot be all evil! Also, Fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) cover for Trick or Treat highlighted an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking at. It was a special order and the price for the VHS copy at that time (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not at the ridiculous price. The OZZY-Gene cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release. The company that liberated it probably figured Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie so they'd better put them on the cover! The same thing with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for all five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick or Treat" site and it's surprising how many people think Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped maintain that myth by dedicating their sound album to 'Sammi Curr'. <br /> Overall, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. Definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed!
