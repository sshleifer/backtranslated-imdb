This show is wonderful. It has some of the best writings I have ever seen. It has brilliant leadership of the Dvid Trainer, who also instructed another smart TV series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is one of the greatest without a dought. As the third company, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be on television for a long time to come. From it's perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you'd only dream of, this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't. This show appeals to the young and the young at heart. A perfect show.
