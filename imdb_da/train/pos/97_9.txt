this was a favorite Christmas special, which I wish they would publish on vhs or dvd when my 33 rpm was lost and all the cartridges I made are also far away. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John Denver fan, but was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin (esp Little St. Nick!) It also contained a few little ones known songs (original?). Although it was finished in the late 70's, this show had a timeless mood. Hope to find a copy soon !!!
