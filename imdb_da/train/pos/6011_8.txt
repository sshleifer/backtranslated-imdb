in my opinion, the center of the film, especially the love scene is a little too long, but all the time you can imagine this desert feeling. But the best thing that made this movie unforgettable is the big explosion pictures, their color, slow motion and the pink floyd music are unique in movie history! <br /> <br /> destruction in its plugs and popular shape.
