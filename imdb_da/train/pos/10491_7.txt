A lovely gentle comedian gem until the last five minutes that degenerate during the mill British television farce. The last five minutes it cost 2 points in my rating. Despite this great plot and style flaw, it is worth looking at the sign and the unique Cornwall setting. Many nice little pieces to taste, just as the tense eternity we all go through is waiting for bank approval, after the clerk has pushed the credit card ... made more piquant when we are not - quite sure that the card is not maxed.
