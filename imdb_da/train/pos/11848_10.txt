Well, what can I say, this movie really came to me, it's not as bad as many say, I really loved it, even though the idea seems so simple and boring, it's not. First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second, the simple story and the drama of the Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic, they do now, but ... I don't do it The animals' speech is just that ... lame. One of the most beautiful animations in 2002, in my opinion, I recommend to everyone, not just the children :) because it is a lot of relaxing.
