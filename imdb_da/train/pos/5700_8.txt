I've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to watch it on DVD. To be honest, I really don't know what the problem is with that. It is a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from various points of view, from an eccentric cast of often-powered potential killer / suspects, including the late porn king, John Holmes. Please read plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot - I want to contribute more to a review than a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence, but I really can't see it. Many modern films were worse. The savings Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on tacit blood stains than the actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were made with lead tubes afterwards). <br /> <br /> I was thrilled with both halves of the movie - the first showing John Holmes as a hopeless cash-hungry drug addict, and the other half showing his side as a minor conspiracy in a meaningless carnage. The movie has excellent plays, although Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little on his biker-esque personia and goatee'd bad boy personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a fantastic mix of 70's B-side rock and obscure pop, spread over a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.
