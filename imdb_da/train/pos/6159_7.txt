This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She doesn't want them, but reluctantly takes them in. She seems to be studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come on !!) Before she can finish the course even though the college is closed due to the war (???) and she is looking down Chief Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And her and the kids travel around on a bed using a magical bedknob. <br /> <br /> I saw the first thing when I was 9 and wary remembering to love it. It probably does not hold up as an adult! The story is stupid (even for a fantasy), the kids are horrible actors, and one of them (Charles) is incredibly uncomfortable. Also Roddy McDowall is the third picture and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the Isle of Naboombu, run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney), and it has a very violent and far too long football game between the animals. There are a few savings here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just big; the songs (while forgettable) are comfortable; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end. But the weak story line, poor animation and unlikable kids really pulls this one down. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give this a 7.
