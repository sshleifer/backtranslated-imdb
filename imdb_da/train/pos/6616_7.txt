This is a movie I decided to go and see because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I find quite often that when a movie does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be considered a work of art rather than a showcase of the actors' ability to separate his styles . <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely more about style than history. While I found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows history and atmosphere from movies like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was a bit difficult to follow at times and didn't feel it all came together as well as it could have. It certainly had a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese anime that came together. Whether it's a good thing or not, is up to the viewer. Visually, this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation or would like to watch a movie that differs from most movies at the moment. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the experience of the movie, but got away a little disappointed because it could have been better
