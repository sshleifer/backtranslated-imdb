Anyone who has experienced the fear of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a frightened little boy who thinks a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a fascinating Anthony DeMarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? Or could the creature be genuine? Writer / Instructor Shelli Ryan balances both options and keeps the audience guessing. Her choice of using a setting - a suburban house - adds to the sense of desperation and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are convincing as the angry but loving parents. But it's the creepy little characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a monster babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), an insidious estate agent who sleeps in the mind. Jake's Closet is a dark inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
