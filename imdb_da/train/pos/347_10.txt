Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher movies. The death scenes are elaborate, and most of the play is good. Marley Shelton did well as the female manager (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the "I Know ..." movies). David Boreanaz, the main reason I saw this movie, had a rather small role, but he played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was horrible in this. The only scene I was happy to see in her was * SPOILER * her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely see this before you see "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
