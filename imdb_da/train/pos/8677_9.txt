This movie seems to be well remembered as the time Tom & Jerry signed a peace deal. Things are idyllic for a while, but predictably it goes sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless battle that involved a tube, a frying pan and a baseball bat that the two plus Butch dog participated in at the beginning and end of the short. I enjoyed a lot and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
