Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue a fourteen-year-old girl who has lost her mother and finds it difficult to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment finds a secret magic elevator that takes her back to the end of The 18th century she meets with two other children who have lost their father and are facing poverty ... <br /> <br /> I clicked through the channels and found this. I read synopsis and then suddenly Elisa Cuthbert ... I thought okay .... and looked at the movie. I didn't understand that Elisa had made movies before .... 'The Girl Next Door and 24' Elisha gives a satisfactory performance, the plot is a bit cheesy, but the movie works ... It's amazing how this young girl continued to be the hottest child in Hollywood!
