This is by far the most incredible movie I've seen for a long time. The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the film. The story was accurately portrayed. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She has become a member of the LDS Church and he does not. He thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and being offensive. She urges him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film depicts his life and some of the LDS Church history at the same time. It was sometimes graphic, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very credible, causing my emotions to blow out. Filming was amazing. The way the story was presented touched. After the movie was over, we were just unable to move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I urge you to see this. If nothing but gaining some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. This is a must see.
