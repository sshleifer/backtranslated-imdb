A Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for children but also for adults. The story is set around a marsh colony and their fight against the evil grasshoppers coming back every year and stealing their food (a mirror of the Magnifying Seven). There are some wonderful computer animations and the voices are also good. You will love it !! 8 out of 10
