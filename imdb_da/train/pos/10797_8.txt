Composed, elegant Carol (wonderfully played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her beautiful husband Eddie (sympathetic David Houseman), Carols wacky, constantly eats best crazy pal Anna (lovely essayed with contagious comic zeal by the sweet Chris Jordan) and Anna's hunky, amorous man Pete (a typical fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet released swingers who enjoy frequent group sex with each other. Their usual routine is disturbed when Carol's lonely, repressed, yet appealing widow mother Jennifer (an excellent movement of the lovely Jennifer Welles) falls by. Well soon, Jennifer loosens and becomes a willing participant in swingers' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle, with all but Carol eager to seduce her. Author / Director Joe Sarno highlights a sharp, engaging and convincing study of the ancestors' anxiety and the limitations of the entire wild'n'asyasy 70 sexual revolution; Sarno changes traditional middle-class pain on the head and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot. In addition, Sarno uniquely evokes first-class actors from the bang-cast cast: Welles and Brooke are both exceptional with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton as a sour neighbor Mrs. Fields. Even better, all women are extremely hot and enticing; Welles in particular adjoins the screen with its exquisite successful figure and smoldering erotic presence. Sex scenes are really sizzling and quite explicit, but never raunchy or boring. Stephen Colwell's bright, polished film and Jack Justis bouncy, melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective. Recommended view for Sarno fans.
