Due to its release time, the story that revolted in the 1950's 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise. The body of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and handed over as no one until further investigation by a public health inspector who claims that the body carries a bubonic plague. But with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this movie be credible to today's viewers. Cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role after his breakthrough in 'Night and the City', Jack Palance in his chill film debut, also starring in this movie is Paul Douglas and a young (and pretty sweet) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole bunch of uncredited, non-professional players (typical of Kazan's director) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald's movie (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in the 1953's very superior "Pickup on South Street") and the great Alfred Newman scores it. Almost everyone involved here has done better work, although Panic in the Streets is the rewarded watch. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
