I waited ages before to see this as all the reviews I read of this said it was terrible! I rented it expecting the worst, and while it is hardly the best sandal film out there, there is much worse! Sandler often speaks with the camera, and the film does not take itself seriously, but it is part of the fun! A good way to waste an afternoon and you can even find yourself laughing once twice! A good movie, worth renting!
