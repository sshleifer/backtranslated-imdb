I used to see Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was just after the Bay City Rollers. I saw it for the Channel family one day and taped it to my then three-year-old daughter. I had forgotten all that I loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoo host, Witcheepoo's makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is definitely low technology. The mayor is certainly the precedent of Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a full-fledged creature with annoying googly eyes. But children love these things. They would way, rather, see a guy work a sock than sit in front of high tech computer animation. There are (mild) slapsticks, but no adult themes like sex or people die, and children accept Jimmy's schemes. Children think it would be nice to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone that their house was on fire and I loved that every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky, she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead. The music is old, but you are really used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She used to sing "different is hard, other is lonely" in the car. My daughter saw this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they are trying to keep the old taste and do nothing like computer animating characters, etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
