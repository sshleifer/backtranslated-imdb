Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I guess I start with the plot. A fianc√© woman (Lucy) arrives at her family home would be man (Mathurin) in France, awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or a person in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will). While waiting, young Lucy teaches about a legend about an animal wandering for centuries before. In the bed tonight, she begins to fantasize about the animal and his rape-related thirst with the former lady of the house. This is where it gets interesting! The plot is really quite thin (and it seems to drag for a while in the middle of the girl), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a big movie theater, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a remotest film about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic look at the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of this. In addition to some horse-on-horse actions in the beginning, "the doughs" are right comics-like, IMO)
