On paper it looked like a good concept: Average rebound guy is a tight bookstore museum curator who really is a hot superhero that saves the world regularly. Director Ivan Reitman and author Don Payne (of "Simpson's"), almost mistakenly misrepresented in having their hero G-Girl (played by striking Uma Thurman), come as a total emergency job as both superhero and secret identity person, Jenny Johnson. The film itself speaks to this in a conversation between Jenny and Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) after his rescue of G-Girl from the Statue of Liberty. Jenny asks Matt curiously what was G-Girl like. Matt replied, "She's kind of naked?" I think the intention was to have Jenny (Thurman) be this lonely young woman who has no one in her life, isolated by her great physical powers. Thurman does the best she can, but her Jenny is a frightening mood swinging in need of Prozac. Luke Wilson is far too breezy in the role of girlfriend and superhero girl friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is also a victim of bad timing that plays Superhero right up, so to speak. With all her quirks and inconsistent writing, I still thought "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" was fun and enjoyed the movie. Since this is an Ivan Reitman movie, this could have been much better. Reitman starts with a great premise and really wastes it. First, we all love the hero. Here is neither Jenny nor G-Girl really the only thing that likes. This is surprising for Uma Thurman, who is usually a charismatic and strong presence. In the beginning she's Jenny / G-Girl just plain weird. Shocking. Because if there is a woman who can play a superhero, is she Thurman ?? she looks good. Only towards the end, her Jenny becomes more sympathetic, rather than caricature. Although "My Super Ex" is not a straight Superhero story, rather a romantic comedy of varieties, it does not give what every superhero mythology requires, a great super villain. Here we have Professor Bedlam aka Barry (Eddie Izzard) who is really evil little. He's not a Lex Luthor. No plans for global dominance. Bedlam rather Barry keeps an angry with G-Girl and expects it to do with their common past. What is bizarre, don't you know who you'd rather spend time with? Bedlam or G-Girl? Luke Wilson's Matt is just "some guy" that happens to be connected with the psycho superhero. One of the annoying things he does is tell him in his conflicting loser friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson makes a bad whacked out impersonation). Wilson sometimes plays it a little too close, and this dilutes his pleasant charm. However, this seems in the comic sex scene with Jenny. Matt while dating Jenny / G-Girl realizes he is in love with his colleague Hannah (perky Anna Faris). So how does Matt go up with G-Girl? Well, it's not beautiful and mostly fun. <br /> <br /> Dramatic Superhero movies work. Romantic comedies with chemistry work. What may be inherently difficult is Superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies. Everyone loves the hero. But the hero nut job? Maybe not. With all of Uma Thurman's talent, she is not able to achieve this convincingly. And she doesn't get enough support from Reitman and Payne. Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative errors. "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is fun and fun. Although everyone involved, the movie could have been super.
