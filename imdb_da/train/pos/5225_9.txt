I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best 'National Lampoon's' movies, it also has a very jailed spit title that basically sums up what the whole movie is about .... Men in White! !!! The story is a fake of many movies, including a Will Smith movie you may have guessed, 'But In Black'. I will not give the end away, but it has a really good ending in is very fun (Leslie Nielsen style humor) from start to finish, especially a little near the beginning when you are in the street that gathers the dustbanks (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty cool trash truck (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The action is not amazing, in fact it is not so good, but that is what makes the movie fun, it is a comedy, loosening !! I love the story, partly because it has been downloaded so far and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other movies. I'm a big fan of non-serious ghost movies, but I'm also a fan of the real thing, and with these movies it's hard to decide which one is better, the movie is first and foremost torn (mentioned earlier in this review ) or the real movie is it, but even when you actually make a spook of comedy film, it actually makes it even harder, but this movie carries it successfully. The two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This movie is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, fun, best story, National Lampoons movie to date !!
