I must admit right from the top, I'm not a big fan of "family" movies these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap. But this one, like the TOY STORY, the former Pixar movie, is very fun. The two main characters were perhaps a little too boring (especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the movie is more than ready for it. The animation looked good, while humor was wide and good. (I especially liked Hopper's line "If I hadn't promised Mom on her death bed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!") And the actors make the voices, except the two leaders, were all fantastic (Denis Leary make an animated film, what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the exits! I hope the video has the new ones.
