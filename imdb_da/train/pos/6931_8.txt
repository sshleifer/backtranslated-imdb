In 1955, five years after this was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films, four of them western. Their report was obvious from the beginning and what was thought to be a little more than a universal program became both a cult and a classic. The pearls of the period will fear that the first ten names of the credits were more than familiar - and it doesn't count on Ray Teal or Anthony Curtis, who later becomes Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the psychological western was firmly anchored, but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab in the mix with Cain and Abel, not to say anything about solving several other issues along the way and still delivering a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. One to add to the DVD collection.
