I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie! It was clear that this movie was not so bad, otherwise people wouldn't even talk about it afterwards. I personally enjoyed this movie tremendously and still do! I suppose this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly affected many people's hearts. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "overstated" or "overheated" ... well, we only have the cinematic public to thank for it! lol * You see, it's not CRITICS / article writers who make a movie "HUGE" or "HIT" with the general film-making public. PEOPLE make the movie a great success. With the Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's see it, a movie like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship that actually sinks. This movie is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sink of the ship in the movie with REAL sinking the fateful day in April 1912. Even silverware for goodness matched! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started to hear with WORD OF MUTH (which is the best form of advertising, you think) that this was a good / decent / movie worth seeing, then everyone started to flock to the theaters in droves to watch this movie ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So I really didn't want to say that this movie was "overhyped" ... at least not as the build for MATRIX reloaded or HULK is "overhyped". ha! Critics didn't even think that the Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic movie budget as it took to make this mammoth a movie. But the film's money took care of the 200 million budget and more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. But this movie may not be for everyone. Don't say that this movie just sucks because of romance though! It's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! Dislike a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's look it out ... the real star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC ship! I think all actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a good job. It's not their best job (I've seen much better work from both of them), but it wasn't the WORST thing I've seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
