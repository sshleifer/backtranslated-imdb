This is one of the best of the series placed up there with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (Or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good story where you play as Claire Redfield in search of his brother Chris Redfield (Who You probably know from the original Resident Evil) It's as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many more cut scenes. My rating: **** out of ***** Stars (Rating based on comparison with other video games)
