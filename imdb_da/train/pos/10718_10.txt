Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It is a great story and also inspires others. The action was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later because of her performance in the movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie. <br/> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming up. I knew one of the Challenger Astronauts from since childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus where my father went to school; I also know a close friend with a late pilot. <br /> <br /> I was the technical review last year for the National BSA for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge, and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend that scouts do Space related merit badges I teach. <br /> <br /> I ran back into the late astronaut as an adult and followed an engineering training schedule we had put together when Challenger jumped up. I settle down with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", going over things after the accident at the Astrotech General Assembly by chance as a result, so I'm much closer to the accident and any similar movie. I made sure I was a good student and finished the degree four years later, strangely enough on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and who later built Endeavor.
