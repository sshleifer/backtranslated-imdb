Along with "King of the Rocket Men", this was still repeated on BBC TV in the early mid-1980s. If I make a time capsule of this period, both series would definitely enter. <br /> <br /> Someone who sees it for the first time will think it's stupid, but this is one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro makes you laugh (When I was a kid, my nickname was to him, Mr Dustbin's head), and it was fun when he was shot when he said, "Your bullets can't hurt me," he stumbles back, apparently less than happy. I also like the way he holds with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I saw this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect to include water, rockfalls, carriages ... Except the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) was the swordplay not as good as I remembered it and yes it contains the inevitable "flashback" episode! It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend the book by William Witney, "In a door, in a fight, next to a door, in a chase", although there is only a small entry on this series in it .
