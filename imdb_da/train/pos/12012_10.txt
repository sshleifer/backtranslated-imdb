I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I assume that your enjoyment of this movie will largely be based on the acceptance level of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> But it was very well made, well-acted and had a good score. If you come to Salt Lake City, it is a must see in the Legacy Theater. I have never been to a nicer theater in terms of image quality, sound quality and atmosphere throughout my life ... I wonder if the Church would let me see Batman Begins there! Being that I am LDS and considering Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times ... which I suppose is supposed to have expected since the tissues released before the movie started! Still, I am told that this movie is available in several LDS Visitor Centers all over the world, if you have 70 minutes, check it out, or if you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
