I almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyway. I thought it was like darkness that I also liked. The only part I hated about the dentist was the 2 red-hearted brothers at the petrol station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not a comedy. It ruined the movie a little for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was the way a horror or thrill movie should be. Make-up was good and I've seen way worse movies than this one. It was a simple story with credible plays. It's not the scary or goriest movie, but I wasn't ticked off or want a refund after seeing it. On the DVD there were previews of other movies that everyone looks good and I want to check them out.
