Any way wind blower is Tom Barmans (who is also known as the front man in the rock formation 'dEUS') debut film. Fully shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the film starts on a sunny day Friday and jumps rather shallow between events that fill the day with a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have many things to think about because most of the different stories are open. <br /> <br /> The movie has a (purely instrumental) soundtrack that will rock your socks off. In most scenes, the music really enhances the general atmosphere and feel, really making the movie hallucinating to see at certain times. The main film in the film, the party, is very well shot. <br /> <br /> The conductor did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, as his protagonists danced on one of the best audio tracks I've heard lately. <br /> <br /> The play is good stuff. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. The costumes are very warm and also very much '70s. And I loved most of it. What I liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interleaves. <br /> Without claiming to be a comedy (this movie is certainly not a comedy, but rather an alternative work of art), it still manages to giggle the audience and even jump to laughter. <br /> <br /> This is yet another director's debut that shouldn't end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future, because I was fine. Bowl.
