There are moments in the movie that are so terrible, your teeth hurt. But when we knew there were only a few weeks left before the code made movies harmless and bland, Paramount rushed this into production, before induendo and leering went out of style. Vanities are so horrifically anti-female that it is delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women appear with price lists that would offend a Bronx hooker. They come out of clams (nudge, nudge, blink, blink) in positions of absolute submission. Minions of the law, so stupid they cannot find the door, look up at their skirts and snicker. Just breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (may they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) While listening to "Sweet Marijuana" and seeing as the blood falls on a chorine's chest. Carl Brisson taught his lines phonetically and does not seem to have a clue as to what he says. But it's all worth it when Norma steals the show while no one is watching. <br /> <br /> If you take a moment of this fragile fluff seriously, you lack the point throughout the exercise. Watch this with a charter member of the NU and prepare to justify the entire Hollywood machismo sch tip between body beats. <br /> <br /> By the way, Toby Wing is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> A must stroll down Memory Lane.
