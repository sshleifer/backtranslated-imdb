If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you check this out. It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, who apparently has a great time to shoot some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but fun to watch and leave you feeling like they are just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional, who rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. If you see him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a good time playing some great songs with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances. It is true that a few songs are missing, which I would like to have seen there, but like any album it cannot have everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I wanted to know it came out in 1972, I would definitely have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love of cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car accident!
