It is depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of strokes, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in the nineties, and one would expect a slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he takes the back seat of Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there is 'Kung Fu Panda' where he not only has a purely vocal role, but his character has almost no dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> It's sometimes the case when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some asses in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker-free days. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose task is to protect a witness before a major attempt. He faces opposition from both the uncooperative witness and the many hit men sent by the mob to silence both of them. But on the other hand, who cares? We don't see Jackie Chan's movie for the story. We see them watching Jackie Chan perform eye-catching stunts and generally beat and kick a lot of people who are less awesome than he is. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' doesn't disappoint at all. There is a fantastic showdown in a mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a huge high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened more often, no man would ever have to gather to shop for clothes. There is also comedy, many of which involve Kar-kui by accidentally disturbing May (Maggie Cheung), his ever-suffering and seemingly forgiving boyfriend. The humor on the whole is pretty uninhibited, but it works so I don't complain. <br /> <br /> The action is also not too subtle. In fact, I'm not sure there was anything strange about 'Police Story' at all. Director Jackie Chan (yes he does too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we see his film and know that while we wait for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to look for shade and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So 'Police Story' is a blast. As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the things you see on the screen puts the head and shoulders over the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really hangs from a shuttle bus with an umbrella, a brand new "Wow!" factor added to the action.
