How can anyone not love this movie? I think it's a fun spoof of all the old gangster movies; If you've never seen them, see this instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as something goes. A man lacks the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays a clueless D.A., but my favorite role should be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston is in this stellar movie that lets gangsters much more fun than "Mafia" did for the criminal underground.
