Strange erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans worldwide. Seems to be an interesting take on "Beauty and the Beast". It is definitely worth a visit and surprisingly well-acted when considering the genre and the era. Corsets, castles, equestrian horses, rampant faux fur monsters in the woods, evidence that no one had a Brazilian in the 70's, and more body fluids than you can shake a stick on, what more could you possibly have?! <br /> <br /> It was probably my Sunday afternoon!
