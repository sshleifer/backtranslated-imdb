I don't know what movie some of these other people were watching, but they must have seen another "Joseph Smith: Prophet of Restoration" than the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both well-designed and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth seeing. It is clear from the start that great care was taken in this film. The background is beautiful. I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith as both a man and a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching this movie.
