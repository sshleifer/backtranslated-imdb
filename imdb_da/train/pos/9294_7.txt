Before I begin, I must point out that I know the editor of this movie. We have never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (the things that came before notice boards) and we have talked on the phone so I have a bias here. Anyway ... It is somehow ironic how, while the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 50s and early mid-60s made a comeback in the mid-90s , this movie, from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, which was made in a similar way, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I think Peter Travers from Rolling Stone was the only one who did not miss this (he gave it a mixed review as I recall). And although I don't think this is the biggest movie in the world and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> First, it looks stylish and moves straight together. For another, the core performances are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly detained here as the main gangster returns from a sanitarium and has a dragon edge to him. Jeff Goldblum goes back to the silent ironic achievements he gave in his pre-blockbuster days like THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin only needs to vamp in this movie, she makes it entertaining. It is certainly not a good movie; The dialogue mostly consists of puns, and many of them do not work (like the whole "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are horrible here. Still, I was entertained, and if you like gangster movies, you might as well.
