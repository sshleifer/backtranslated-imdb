A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location sources in Ohio power this fine television movie about tough times in the rust belt. As the turbines close and the trade unions disappear, the permanent workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is absolutely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed is as always wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he attaches weight. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal score - was anyone making a pun? - is sometimes annoyingly annoying, but the movie by Frank Stanley is knockout, especially mill scenes.
