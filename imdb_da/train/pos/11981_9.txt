"FULL HOUSE," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've ever seen every episode, but I've still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how it made it fun then you should have seen it yourself. It was a two-party so you should have seen both. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) are locked in a petrol station on Michael's birthday. You should also have seen it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many others that I also like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you to catch it, just if it goes well into the air.
