And LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys are going to sweep the chimneys in the home of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenation space. Stan & Ollie continue with their DIRTY WORK, which spreads destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the professor will try his new potion ... A very funny little movie. The finish is a bit abrupt, but much of the slapstick that leads up to it is fantastic. Especially good is Stan & Ollie's will on the will at opposite ends of the chimney. It is Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
