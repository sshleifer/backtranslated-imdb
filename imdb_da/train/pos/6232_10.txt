One of the best of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers film. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Amazing songs are "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All My Eggs in a Basket." The last song is introduced by Astaire, who plays a jazzy piano and then a sweet dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let yourself go" with Grable among backup singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two fine songs and plays Rogers' mousy sister. "Get Behind Me" is a song that stays with you for days. She also sings "but where are you?" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones. The classic and stunningly beautiful final, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is among the best known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great movie story dresses ... a shiny sequined number that works around the legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly cut. Just beautiful. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as Astaire's friend, but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he doesn't try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had larger parts in 1936, but they have a few scenes and have little influence. Allwyn has the bigger role but is just OK. Rogers has one of her best solo songs in the series "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and pounding, it's a good song. <Br /> <br /> Fun all the way, even though I got tired of "We became a fleet" after the third time ....
