Okay - I confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone making a parody of James Cagney, with charm as extra. <br /> <br /> The support supports are solid workers all and will step up and do a good job in this 80's comedy. A spear of the '30s' 40s gangster film, it completely breaks new ground constantly, with remarkably original material. (Yes, yes - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made, it was original and much of it has not been copied elsewhere.) See Joe Piscopo warn people not to ______ with one of them the large taglines of spoofs. See Roman Moronie doing things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. See amazing eye gags, such as pet store owner Johnny Kelly using the price tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens. See the biggest "warning against sex" educational films ever made. See the most amazing misrepresentation of the Church Latin done while a guy who never took a store class gathers a Thompson machine gun from parts. Watch lines you will use in casual conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton makes the perfect contrast to the hard-hitting mother, with surprising gags that you never see coming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that doesn't hit your fun leg, be patient - someone else will come together in 30 seconds or less, and the odds are you'll have to pause until you're finished rolling on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? You too. Look for the subtle things - some of the sight gags can go unnoticed the first few impressions. <br /> <br /> There are some minor errors - but that's probably the best of spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are so good.
