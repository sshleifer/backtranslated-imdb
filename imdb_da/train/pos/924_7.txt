The pride father is a pleasant surprise: It is fun, witty and has some good voting effects. The exhibition is about a lion's family that acts as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows. In fact, all of them are stereotypes, but that's what makes them so funny. PHOTP is not a kiddie cartoon, it contains some roughly adult humor, but in a very mild way. It's full of pop culture references and celebrity cameos, and most of them are performed very well. I'd say I'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it's fine, quite well done, but not very original, I've seen most stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
