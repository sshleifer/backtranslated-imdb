I have no idea how to describe this film, and would also love to give others the same opportunity I had - see it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it immensely, but can also say that I hardly understood what was going on if there was actually something to understand in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin movies should especially enjoy this and all fans of the EIGHTBALL comic will probably be next to themselves with joy and wonder (it came as close as any movie I've seen to the tone and mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively. <br /> <br /> Just a little note just to warn someone slightly offended - this movie, if judged, would be NC-17 for sure. Fans of male full frontal nudity, though ... hmm, yes ... yes. These are strange, wild things.
