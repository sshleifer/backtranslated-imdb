What a great gem this is. It's an unusual story that's fun to see. Yes, it sings, but it is very nicely crafted in history and is very melodic to hear. It was so comfortable to see; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It's about an apprentice witch searching for a missing part of a spell she needs. She uses her hard "magic" to transport her and 3 children during her care to different destinations to find it. They are with her correspondent teacher who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a little dated at first, when they turn to them, they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to see. I think anyone of any age could find something to like about this movie.
