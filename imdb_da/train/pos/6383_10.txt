I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. Therefore, I did not see it as simply family entertainment, and I still enjoyed it thoroughly. It seems that many of the reviews point out that this movie is not earthquake, there were no unexpected plot changes, and the movie was predictable and boring. If these people looked at this movie, expecting to have a religious experience, then of course they will be disappointed. This is simply an animated movie; nothing more. If you want to watch this movie just to sit back and be entertained, you will not be disappointed. Eventually, it's certainly not the best movie Disney has made, but it's entertaining and I don't understand the bad reputation it has received.
