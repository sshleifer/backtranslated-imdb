Let's start with the theme song that was sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the moon and New York City." It's a good theme and a song even after all these years, it never gets tedious. It's also a good song about New York City. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire engaged to Jill Eikenberry's character in the movie. Jill would later be on LA Law. Anyway, he's earned with his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Oscar for his performance in the movie as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character, which is perfect in this film in addition to her performance in her Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza will not sing. She plays a dining room waitress. Still, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach Matriarch family, who determines family happiness. Anyway, she's fabulous and should have gotten an academic award nomination even for best supporting actress. Barney Martin known as Jerry's father at Seinfeld plays Liza's father. He is also wonderful. The film was well-written, acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.
