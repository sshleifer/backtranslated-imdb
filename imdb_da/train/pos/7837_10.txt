Clips from the Wembley concert are mixed with surreal sketches that nuns gorging themselves on a garden party as Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I still learn the song titles). George Claydon, the diminutive photographer of the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver jumping out of a car and eating one of the exterior mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would ruin it, even if I put the spoilers' disclaimer on this review, so you would just have to see this for yourself. It avoids description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and was curious that Ringo steered a rock documentary - it was 35 years ago - now I finally find out that it has been on DVD for 2 years, but it is finally in my home.
