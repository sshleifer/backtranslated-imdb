I disagree with anyone who doesn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to love this movie when I was a kid and I still do. It's sweet, fun and warms your heart. And it shows that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it didn't have much of a story, it was still excellent, I give it a 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it shows that your deepest desire and dreams can come true. (Tears, tears) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally if anyone says it's sucked than I would say "Shame on you". Because it was a nice little movie and I'm glad at least some people liked it.
