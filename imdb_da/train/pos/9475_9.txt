The most satisfying element of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The cast of the Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dancing's love interest was a fantastic decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and thank goodness, appropriate age for that part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect movie for adults interested in a mature comedy that leaves the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula : stupid chicks, chauvinist guys and stupid jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughing all the way through. While other comedies are included or almost exclusively based on jokes that choke the audience to laugh, the "Dan in Real Life" jokes are more natural and clever and involve some audience thinking. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious middle-aged is being played too violently by actor Brittany Robertson. It is hard to say whether this was a personal choice on his part or a choice of the director. In any way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But it's just a minor flaw in the movie, and doesn't take away from the story as a whole. All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a great escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) filmography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
