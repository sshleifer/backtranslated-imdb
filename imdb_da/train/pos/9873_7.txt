Lily Mars, a smalltown girl living in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway and her hopes will be lifted when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to arrange her show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in her next show, only as a benefit to her family, but Thornway is beginning to fall for this young girl and a romance flourish, making the show's leading lady, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets tired of the John-Lily romance that causes friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make the Lily star. Isabel returns, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her little role in the play, which can also endanger romance. Very charming movies and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while it was to be humorous, never threatened her singing career), I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more as he became annoyed with Lily instead of being romantic. The film was supposed to be a bit predictable, and the scenes were not so well assembled, but a very enjoyable movie. Rating 7.
