Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV show I've ever seen! It had some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written by 15 very talented singers / artists. It also had (in my opinion) the most heart-felt, feel-good, surprising conclusions in reality reality TV. It actually made me throw tears of happiness to the winner !!! During the 13 weeks of this television competition, knowledge became known and became known to all participants. After 30-episodes, the remaining participants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality TV show. And the fact that INXS was and still is one of the biggest rock n 'roll bands ever added to the emotional excitement created by this wonderful reality series. If you haven't recorded the series, the ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a good alternative.
