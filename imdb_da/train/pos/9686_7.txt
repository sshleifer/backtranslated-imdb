A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (with a voice disturbance) who treasures his green parrot Paulie. Parrot is thinking and talking as a human being and giving help and advice to his constant companion. Parrot is definitely the star's movie. Sometimes rude and sometimes during depression, the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well done, and within a few minutes you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists. Early in the film, her father gives the bird to a farmer's broker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie's constant struggle for many years to be united with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad business and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic counter machines. Paulie thinks it has a phenomenal memory. The end is predictable, but who else would have it. Children will love this movie, and anyone who keeps a bird as a pet will enjoy Paulie's antics.
