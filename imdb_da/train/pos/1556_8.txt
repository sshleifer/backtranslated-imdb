Like other people who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I accidentally fell on this little gem on sennat tv without having heard of it before. The strange mix of a pulp-fiction story of a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine and, on the other hand, a realistic and well-researched depiction of war in the trenches on the other side, I had heard from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the five best films about WWI (the others are "All Quiet On The Western Front", "Paths of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the post war "La vie et rien d'autre "). And the scene with poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men look like the apocalypse owners with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I just wish I had lost the movie.
