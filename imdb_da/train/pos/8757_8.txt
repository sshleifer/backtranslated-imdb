I like movies that do not give the typical "happy ending" and that is my main reason for my taste of this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after a tip anonymously called the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing whether (or which) girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim will be a great achievement as her more friendly, magnificent wife Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls had been abused more in prison, as another commentator has suggested, as I have heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. However, where this movie grabs me, it's the end. Alice submits a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be forgiven and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any movie that endures my expectation of the end wins extra points with me, and this well-run drama is certainly deserved.
