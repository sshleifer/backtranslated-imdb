Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horror (non-graphic), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago, I saw this movie in a revival with a newly printed print, and I was amazed at how well it was today. I thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but somehow they looked forward and modern. Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and just feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still being an increase out of me. The Krell monster, appearing in the beams, still scares the bejebees out of me. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that "The Great Bird of the Galaxy" probably assumed much of "Star Trek" from this movie. No one has yet beaten Robby, Robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie is generally the standard that any other Science Fiction movie has to measure up to! Honest mention for the joking electronic score that kept us all on pins and needles.
