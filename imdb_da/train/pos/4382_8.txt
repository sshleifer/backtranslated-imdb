Shaded by "Braveheart" released the same year, they compare the two costume drama. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" show convincing Scottish history in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic paean for individual honor and courage and a fine revenge imagination. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note its cornball use of slow motion filming. Its violence is both ugly and brilliant. It is the last quality that makes it more attractive to young thinking. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" in pure levels of carnage (not to mention his compassionate time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its action is more discreet, even more surprising and clever. Its sex is less flashy, even more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better realized romantic interest. Its dialogue seeks to approximate the poetry of the period. Its rotten teeth in the mouth of the actors are trying to approach the dentist. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot." You can find the latter more akin to "Braveheart" with an emphasis on blood loss, with the former more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the above films deserve their R ratings for violence.
