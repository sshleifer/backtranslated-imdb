Like many here, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think it has been very well done and well thought out. Everything about it marks it as a spin-off, which is not intended to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy. Using the familiar Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it is much easier to engage the viewer with parody humor from the beginning of every 30 minute episode. There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs that have annoyed fans. The classic is Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80s. These spin-offs had their place: They allowed new content to be sold, created new fans and kept Scooby-Doo items on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a clue!" does not fit in with this traditional role, but it is probably what I always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the best / funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad guys, the "Best Friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Bad Features: None, although the renewed Mystery Machine is pretty close at times. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
