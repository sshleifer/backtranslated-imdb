I just finished watching this movie and found it very fun. It is a quiet, small movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It just takes you into the life of the people who live in a small village in the backwoods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a great performance like Raymond Toker, a young lonely who finds a baby abandoned in the woods. Toxer's search for the child's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy conman with a rear motif. And David plays the bad guy to perfection. <br /> <br /> There's much more to this movie than first meets the eye. Filmed in place in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it is worth seeing.
