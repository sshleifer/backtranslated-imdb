I've seen a few Cold Case episodes over the years, starting with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some may not agree with the content of history (ie, the male to the romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could see this without being deeply moved in their spirit. The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two key players are two police officers in the 1960s named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In history, Coop is single, a Vietnam war teacher, with a deeply troubled past. However, Jimmy is married to children, not less. Both are partners in the police force and not only form a friendship but a secret romantic relationship, which they both must hide from a deep and, of course, homophobic culture prevailing at that time. <br /> <br /> The feedback stage in their lives is mostly in black and white, with bits of color occasionally sprinkled throughout. Examples are their red squad car, the yellow curtains blow gently at the window of Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife saw Coop and Jimmy, drinking, fighting and then kissing each other while in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still haven't figured out the color scheme and the reasons. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between the co-patrol and the two key players only increases the intensity of the episode. An important emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected colleague on the force, confronted Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. You can be upset Coop at the time when Coop's father was ashamed and shamed at Coop - "You won't argue our family ... and you're not my son either." - clearly indicative of the hostile views of the same gender in the era. <br /> <br /> Further tensions can also be seen in the police protection room, where Coop and another officer go after it, after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin Homos". <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once, we can see the excitement of Jimmy's face as he must choose between his involvement with his wife and children, his church and yet his immortal devotion to Coop. In the end, Jimmy goes away from Coop, realizing he can't have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of the drug money and police corruption that reached higher power. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene of the entire episode was when Coop, as he was dying of firearms in his trophy car, clearly spoke his last words about his police radio to his partner: "Jimmy ... We were the lucky ones. Don't forget it. "<br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was excellent throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, playing still grieving Jimmy, only much older now and still missing her former partner, Coop. I highly recommend this episode and consider it best. It is undoubtedly the most well-written, well-run and well done by all Cold Case episodes that I have ever seen.
