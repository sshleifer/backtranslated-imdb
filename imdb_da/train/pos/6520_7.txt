The original DeMille film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A really good movie. Hollywood's love for remakes brings us a very interesting movie starring Yul Brynner. He was, of course, brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a brilliant blow. However, the film tends to be a bit long in places. It does not move in the pace of the 1938 edition. Still, it's a fun movie to be seen at least once.
