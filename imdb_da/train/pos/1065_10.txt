Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centered on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman fleeing her creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe absorbs (not as much as Buffy says, but absorbs anyway) with an interesting and credible set of characters. It's certainly not for everyone, but those who give it time will see themselves see one of the most entertaining shows out there. Dark Angel is criminally overlooked and under-rated, and was unfortunately canceled after only 2 series. It was a great shame as this had the potential to be a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long-running BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. As Dark Angel stays unfinished, look it out and if you want more, lobby Fox to make another series.
