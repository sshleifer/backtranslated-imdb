It's hard to top this movie in several ways. Everything works really well here; Casting, acting, scripting and cinematography are all first-rate. For the film gift, it is a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic there is plenty of sharp technique and technical value. There are some tactical blunders, and as it has been discussed on the records, the ending lacks realism if you are rigorous with the CIA agent's training angle. However, I took the end to be more moving because, instead of pursuing the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically allows his soul to Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic meaning or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and only celebrates the wicked one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is worth a look if you even attract the genre. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) movie.
