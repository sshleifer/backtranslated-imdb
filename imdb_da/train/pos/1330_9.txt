Where Tasty was my little Frenchman, tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-conscious. It ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even if you hoped - perhaps even beloved - it wouldn't. <br /> <br /> Externally, this is the movie's greatest strength: it's professionally playing with your emotions and expectations, so a bomb falls on you. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a film theory class at USC back in the mid 90s. It's not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for.
