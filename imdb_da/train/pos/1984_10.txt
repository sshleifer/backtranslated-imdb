One of the finest musicals made, one that is timeless and worth seeing again and again. Delicious! The action, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is excellent. Costumes are exquisite .... even the shabby ones. <br /> <br /> The two young boys playing Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a good job showing Bill Sykes to where you can't help but hopes he'll come to a terrible end .... as he does. <br /> <br /> Dancing is cleverly choreographed and fascinating. Oliver can keep his own with eg. My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
