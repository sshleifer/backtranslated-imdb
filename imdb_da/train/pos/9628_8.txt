Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have very, very little plot. Instead, they give them a fairly everyday situation and just let them be fun! Films like AIDS and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest ones you see boys working or cleaning houses. Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is related to these two other films - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and use most of the film to try (without luck) to clean a crazy professor's chimney. See Ollie fall through the chimney, the boys make the house a total mess and the crazy behaviors of Stanley work together to make a very comfortable movie. <br /> <br /> But in an odd twist, there is also a really strange sub-point that starts and ends the movie. It looks like the professor is really a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. Late in the movie you see him making a duck in a duckling and even a duckling in an egg! So when he leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well was the middle part. Don't give the boys anything exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the team's better movies and it serves almost a 9.
