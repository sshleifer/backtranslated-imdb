With this movie, the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only stars but produces and leads, you know it should be good. Although some say The Enforcer is the best of the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force, the only two are worthy of the series. Although Enforcer is a good movie with a few good action sequences, it does not get the dirty and gritty effect the other three movies do. This movie captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood movie good and it has the quotes that make a Dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry, it's "..you do, punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man has become acquainted with his limitations"; and in this it is "Go ahead. Make my day." Also in this film it is great to see a changing nature, as you get a little tired of seeing the same old San Francisco streets in the other movies in the series. With great plays by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good director of Clint, this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.
