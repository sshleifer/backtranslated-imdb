Sentinel has a kind of run of the mill and klich√©d suspense / mystery, but is lifted with some good plays and tight pacing. These stories have already mostly gone through as many permutations as we can carry, so what we are left with is how good is the play, how smart are the setups and bad, how well designed is the most important plot, etc. Etc. ..... so Sentinel does a solid job given it content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I've seen her on the screen) provides some satisfactory support. The whole affair of the story is absolutely incredible to knock it down a little, but it deserves a slack. Worth to see if you like the genre.
