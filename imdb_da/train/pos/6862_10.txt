When people ask me why do I like movies so much, I usually answer: "Have you seen the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone represents almost everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a film director, that would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "Pure cinema" is a way of describing that order, and it is really amazing to see how director De Palma works throughout the film at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dreamlike movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen movies put together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: Can a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The movie has no message to talk about, acting is great, but it is at the service of the style, and the script is succinctly logical. The Palma's film makes a really good case that the style, when handled correctly, can maintain a movie of its own length. Well, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances, but it's a director's movie all the way to fade out. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I don't want to tell you which Hitchcock movie movie pays tribute to (I don't want to spoil any surprises), but I think De Palma exceeds the arch of history and he manages to make a movie that basically sums up his whole career. Not too weak of heart!
