SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority on this one, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it certainly involves and a totally adrenaline-burned ride. I certainly thought it was worth at least a 7 rating. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked it was because I haven't seen the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this, the strongest fans will be the people who haven't seen the original version and thus have little to compare with. This was not a masterpiece, but I got into it quite a lot, and it actually made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I liked about it. One was casting Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was fantastic and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. When the majority of the film fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a big part for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was that it was made for television. I had no idea that was the case when I saw it. It was probably a big movie, and I would never have guessed that it wasn't a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story to be very absorbent. I'm not one for action movie, but I was sucked into this. Plus it was much more than an action movie when there was drama, mystery, a love story, funny people, anywhere you turned. (I didn't even recognize the priest.) And it touched. This was not a good movie, but it can be seen. <br /> <br /> And then there is the end. It packs a strong blow and if you have been involved in the story until that time, it is very hard not to be transfixed at the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The implication was that Kowalkski survived, and although I am very skeptical about how it would be possible, it is a movie and realism is not an ingredient that is always in the mix when making a movie. <br /> <br /> So I have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative way that I usually don't like, but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie. Admittedly, many things were just props for the plot (could the bad guys have been more stereotypical?) But the decision makers got a lot of justice, even though they also got many things wrong. But when I have said that, I will admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original would hate this version, because even though I haven't seen the original, I have seen many original movies, loved to be recreated with terrible results. (My big reluctance is actually continuing.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of the high quality. <br /> <br /> People have compared this with Smoky and Bandit. What about a road version of "Legends of the Fall" also meets "Thelma and Louese"? I've probably touched both movies (both of which I'm a fan of.) However, I don't think this was a good movie. It was better than average for me, but far from big. But it was an absorbent, adrenaline fueled, moving film with excellent casting of the protagonist. My vote is 7 out of 10.
