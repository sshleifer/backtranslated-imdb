If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we will all remember it. But even I was only 4 when it came out. If you haven't seen it yet, hire dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I spy, Pluto Nash and all Eddie's family comedy movie - so watch it here. Hands down, you will laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% you will wipe the tears from your eyes. It really has to be seen more than once to understand all the jokes. From raw humor to a joke for kids! (If you've seen it, you'll laugh here) - you'll love his stuff. If you can (or are a big fan), try downloading clips from Eddie's actions. All of the shows are different as you could imagine, and he has even more fun jokes. <br /> <br /> But this is like the best of Eddie Murphy 'X-rated' if you want. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say is not to see Delirious, if you don't like comedy, don't have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with. You will only put down this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly get someone to miss it. <br /> <br /> To know how Eddie got the Beverly Hills Cop and became famous by it - Delirious is it.
