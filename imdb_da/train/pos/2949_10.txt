This is the funniest uprising I've ever seen, and I think it's the funniest thing I will ever see. If you don't shock with laughter at the absolute hilarity, then it's just not your cup of tea. But I honestly don't know anyone who has seen this, who didn't want it. It is now 17 years later, and my friends and I quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to fish games, Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man, Ralph and Ed to get out !! There are as many individual and collective sketches of hilarity here that if you honestly haven't seen this movie then you lose out on one of the best stand-ups ever. Take some of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even the great ones like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass that. I don't know how or where Murphy got some of his material, but it works. That's what it comes to. It's fun as hell. Can you imagine how this show should have shocked people who were used to Eddie making buckwheat and Mr Rogers and so on SNL? If you listen to the audience when he jumps his first joke or when he says the F word for the first time, they are in full shock. <br /> <br /> His first time he says the F word is when he shits that Mr T is gay. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hello boy. You look very cute in jeans. Come here and f!" <br /> <br /> The crowd breaks out in laughter's happiness. No one was expecting the dirty mouth that he let loose on them. But the results were just awesome. I've never been scared with relentless comedies like I was in this stand-up. In fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much about laughing, it was only in 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT. The comedy was raw and unhygienic, and it went to the jugular, just as it was DELIRIOUS. I don't think it's possible to see this piece of cartoon and not laugh. It's almost twenty years later, and it's still the funniest horrible thing on video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids fishing last week. And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing rod back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus. Normal kids don't shit like Gus. Then they began to move their heads around here, and **** **** came up with fish, then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said you can believe this f **** n shit?! "Watch it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
