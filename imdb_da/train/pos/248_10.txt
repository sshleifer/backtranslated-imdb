'Ned Kelly' is a wonderfully made Australian movie called a true Australian hero. We are taken in the world by Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of the Kelly Gang, which the film explains and may justify Ned's actions. There is an unusual cast present, all of which gives the star performances that bring the movie to life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was great as Joe plays the role of quiet, loyal lady very well. I was swept up at the moment. For a moment I almost thought that time would win the battle of Glenrowan, unfortunately it was not. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are fictional, and as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed with this. Maybe the movie could also be longer to cover more of Kelly Gang's / Neds life - I didn't feel enough covered. <br /> <br /> Whether it was a couple of mistakes, this is a moving movie that touches all sorts of emotions. (And hey, I would assume that this movie would be better to see rather than Mick Jagger trying to portray Down ...)
