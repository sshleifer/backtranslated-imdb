Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this "modern" musical version showing MacDonald's comic abilities. Surreal 40s musical seems to be fun by the 40s fashion, even as they were in the current fashion. Eye-catching costumes and sets (yes B & W) add to the surreal, dreamy quality of the entire movie. More good songs confuse the movie, with the "Twinkle in Your Eye" number a highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the big cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also in expanded bit parts are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Watching the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug / vamp routines is fun and enjoyable. She could do everything.
