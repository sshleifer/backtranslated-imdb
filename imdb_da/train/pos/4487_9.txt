"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is a good one. At least I like it, so I'm surprised that this will be mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is more of a macabre story than a fun, even though it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and spooky. Suspense is another strong element here. In terms of humor, it is mostly dark humor. In this short, Tom listens to a scary radio program at night and is scared that it's about ghosts, something he thinks. While Tom is afraid of death, Jerry sees everything and can't help laughing all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. Using a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the frightening experience of his entire life. Even though Jerry scares Tom for a good reason, the way the story goes is a fun one. Once again there is no violence here because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I don't get the joke of Tom's 9 life almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that it was all a Jerry's scheme and that Jerry made a fool of him, Jerry is "caught by hand in cookie jar" (he deserves to be discovered) . Yet Tom shows an incredible patience before he reacts. He looks honestly at Jerry for a moment. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be fun, but Tom doesn't laugh. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another quirky and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
