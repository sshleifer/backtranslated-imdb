by Dane Youssef "Coonskin" is a movie, by the only Ralph Bakshi, is allegedly a satirical accusation of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes as well as a look at life's variety in modern America (modern day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, exciting, and a must-see just for definition. Not just another random "shock-jock" of a movie trying to shock for the shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something great to say ... Although roots are based on cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another campy knock off of mainstream white movie or any kind of throwaway flick. "Coonskin" will be more. It aims to increase the sights and fries some much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't just make fun of the genre. It also does not just indicate black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. "Coonskin" tells a story out of some prisoners awaiting a prison. The fact that it is even possible to break out of a prison in the "Coonskin" world alone makes it old-fashioned. One of the inmates tells a story of a trio of black brothers in Harlem called Brother Bj√∏rn, Brother Rabbit, the Priest Fox, who wants respect and a piece of action and is willing to get it any way necessary. The Itallian mob runs all the real action. Big name black musicians star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black dramatist to take home the Pulitzer. There is something big happening of course. The movie plays like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with hatred in the heart and a gun in his hand. Bakshi's film never knows the meaning of the word "sublety". This one looks like it has never been heard about the word. But perhaps a topic like this needs extremism. Real sledgehammer satire. Some items cannot be tackled carefully. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is the godmother relentless. Here is no member or minority of the Harlem scene unharmed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real" depending on what mood and situation are. The animated characters and humans all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never just shows nasty caricatures just for shock value. He always has something to say. Nor is black-face free. Unlike in Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using it to really try to say something. Like 99.9% of all Bakshi's movies, this animation and live action feature. Normally at the same time. Bakshki is not just gimmicky here. This technique is all intertwined, together with something. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this inevitably feels dated. Many of these types of movies (Bakshi are included) are very current, very pointed at the moment. They reflect the current trend of the day, but look back on those years later that are just an unmistakable sense of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). Though the music, the clothes, the snake and the city clearly look like images belonging to a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same, no matter what. Anyone who has really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in the company of the people knows what I'm talking about. Even some of the black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big ol bear and a fox. One of the most acidic and eerie racist characters is a dirty Harlem policeman who is warm on the track of these "dirty n" s after a policeman's death. But for him it's not just business. Nor is it for the other brothers who carry the shield. It's just plain sadistic racist pleasure to hurt blacks. <br /> <br /> The sequence involving Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole movie, many of which are. It plays like an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> Promo line: WARNING: "This movie offends everyone!" This is not just hype. Continue with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You've been warned ... by Dane Youssef
