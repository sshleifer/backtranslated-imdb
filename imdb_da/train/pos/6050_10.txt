Finally! A decent British comedy that is not centered around some mockney bank robbers or spun from a television series. John Ivay's movie is a psychoactive tale of discovery, dressed in biker gear. The three main characters are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of delplots to sew the rebellious comedy together. The chemistry between the three amigos is tangible and creates a touching companion with hilarious dialogue and some classic comic moments. It feels part Withnail and I, some American werewolf in London, and part Quadraphenia (but only because of the bike bends and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels' beloved rogue reminds you of Danny, the dealer in Withnail and I, with his scientific approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have past in psychoactive substances in the past who will relate to many moments in the movie. A personal favorite is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner store that buys munchies as you stumble upon 'shrooms'. This gentle comedy will warm the hearts of the heart and let you laugh aloud. And you don't have to cycle or even like them to enjoy it. But it will add to it if you do. Brilliant.
