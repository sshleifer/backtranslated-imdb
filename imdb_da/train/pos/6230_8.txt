1936 was the most productive year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second movie to RKO that year is the third movie in this collection ?? Mark Sandrich's 'Follow the Fleet.' This time out, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a sailor on vacation who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront cafe where Sherry Martin (Rogers) curls romantic sweet nothings in everyone's ear. Yeah, you guessed it ?? they are hot to each other again. Only this time, Sherry's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the entire romance by falling to Bake's rugged seafarer, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); some kind of 'em up and throw them out kind of guy, forcing Sherry to rethink his opinion of all sailors in general. Irving Berlin issues an immense class in the case with its classic, classic score, including standards "Let yourself go", "I put all my eggs in a basket" and "Let's see music and dance." the latter a divinely inspired suicide that becomes another recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer to 'Follow The Fleet' is weaker. The gray scale remains nicely balanced, but now it is a little thick look with almost as much tonal variation as the previous titles. Grain is still present. The same is age-related artifacts. Once you have embarked on the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a movie in this vintage. The sound is Mono, but very nicely balanced. Extras include a featurette, theatrical trailer and short subjects, but strange ?? no audio commentary. Considering the importance of this movie in Astaire / Rogers' total canon, this is an uncharacteristic overview from Warner Home Video.
