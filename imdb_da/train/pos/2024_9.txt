I loved this mini-series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job depicting Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her young son, from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romances ... this movie was just my cup of tea, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for a few hours in England in the 19th century. I also have to mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to see this wonderful production.
