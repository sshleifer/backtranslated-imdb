David Lynch usually makes movies reminiscent of puzzles, adding the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about, but they really do not have gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean most to its creator. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Not that there is anything typical about them anyway. It is an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawnmower to come to his brother's house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to make his sick brother into crimes earlier. <br /> <br /> In the heart of this movie is sweet voice Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. That the movie is slowly matching Alvin's slow journey towards realization. <br /> <br /> Alvin encounters a confused and frightened young girl along the way. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin, she talks about family. She reconsidered later. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin witnesses a confused woman killing a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and is leaving. Alvin feels bad, but is smart enough to make some sweet meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's lawns slow down and nearly kill him. A nice man and his wife leave him in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, if haunted by a terrible tragedy in his own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin falls with thanks. As Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a friendly old man as they discuss the hardness of the war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even acknowledges a fatal error, he made like a sniper who has always haunted him. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two bickering brothers who have repaired their lawnmower. He speaks them down in price wise to call them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them appreciate each other's learning from his own mistakes with his brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin leaves man's yard, he takes his hat out to him. The man tells him it was an honor to make him stay and ask Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It is cordial because it is just as true. The journey continues and we cannot help becoming more and more involved in it. We want Alvin to come to his brothers. We want him to make changes. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth's best. It was his last movie and his performance was amazing. You can't help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom, and finally feel his pain. You are taken with him as the man who offers him his backyard to stay in. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth sit together in a bar. I can see them discuss their lives, regrets, hopes and pleasures. As Alvin says in the movie, "My brother and I used to look up at the stars." Now I know they all have the best view in the house.
