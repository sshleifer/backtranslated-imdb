Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my very best experiences at the cinema. I have been intrigued by the mixed response to the movie - and to me, the points of speech indicate the film that is affected by something that is either embraced or disavowed by the general public. It is one of the movies that have stayed with me and I continue to think and think about it. <br /> <br /> Surely, the DVD will illuminate some of the themes and film-making elements? Including: Sidney Lumet's comeback movie, the time-consuming technique used in the story, the amazing combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works so well, the masterful direction, the relatively rare focus of Hollywood movies gives to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open checkbook for their women, the under-represented yet resonant Marisa Tomei's performance, and of course the amazing Hoffman with the central monologue on the sum of his parts - to me the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> Phew! Certainly a masterful movie. So imagine my disappointment seeing the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find any comments, no back scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey distributors - sort it out!
