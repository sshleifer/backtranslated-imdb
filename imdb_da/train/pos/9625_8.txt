By first watching this movie, it is difficult to know exactly what has happened, but with a subsequent display it becomes more clear. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, initially she was out to catch Bob, but I really think she landed loving him even though she had broken her heart. Dean Cain's performance was a usually excellent one. He gets better with every movie he does. My only issue at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left to the viewer to decide
