Saw this movie on DVD yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. The unaffected appearance of DDL just blew my heart, and I was amazed at the whole casting and its amazing plays. The whole character was so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go see it! You cry out your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you an important lesson: Determination is everything. You can be a cripple in the bad suburbs of Dublin, but when you're tough enough, you have no problems at all. If you can only operate your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or author. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to pamper yourself. It won't get you anywhere, and the only person who will pity you will be yourself.
