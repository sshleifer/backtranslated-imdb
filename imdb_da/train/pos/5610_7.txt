Roman Polanski masterfully leads this kind of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can't imagine that there is an honest movie goer who is unable to recognize the finest director in Le Locataire, but both of the depths may not be quite satisfactory to most people themselves. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-insurance, soon to become psychological soon Anxiety, which later flourishes into an irreversible physical disadvantage. The shared trial for the characters and the audience is really different from the scare film's fears and tensions, as there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow for a kind of catharsis (if it is cheap or more elaborate) polanski suddenly tortures us, and if in his last opus the dark humor is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to the edge of our seats. Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because pure paranoia and sheer rationality are in constant struggle: History is about a couple moving in a weird occasion while we have to identify with a single character. What's more, if the fantasy elements are entirely in the hero's mind, the situation is most unpleasant as we, the viewers, are forced to judge him, reject him while we masterfully are the lure ("paint") to be him.
