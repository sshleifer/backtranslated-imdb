You can discuss Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. He seems like a shadowy guy has been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and amazing. <br /> <br /> Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85), I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at that time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to all "Air Band" at the time of Prince's, it was the absolute hottest thing out. For a couple of weeks, the Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and were so excited when it was premiered. It did not disappoint. EVERYONE was caught up. I was an MTV junkie at the time (they actually played music then .... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this comment by saying that at that time my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk / New Wave genre 'The Prince's music at that time exceeded all types and styles. One of the reasons why some of it seems cheesy and contradictory now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then. All the things that remind you of the 80s were so iconic. It was mainstream and it looks like a clich√© now. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like the rappin 'Granny commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was trapped in it (unfortunately, like a bizarre purple macarena or something. Hope I hope it gave you everything a little insight.
