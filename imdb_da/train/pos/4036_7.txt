Good luck finding this movie for yourself - it's not yet released on tape or DVD. I looked at the release in the early 70's, was fortunate enough to capture it through the American Cinematheque's conservation efforts, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. No need to repeat rwint's exact comments here. As a future director shortly after the quick success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N has been said to have steered the low budget effort as well as possible, and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some circumcision. But it's also a memorable icon of it's time: the very intense clashes at the end of the 1960s college sports, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why watch this movie? It was probably a basic breaker in some scenes: the fresh male bonding in the after showers; The Karen Black scene with Carpets in the car will catch you a little vaguely - but it's the first use of a word I hadn't seen in movies before; and the relaxed and unexpected use of nudity. There are probably others I omit. <br /> <br /> Look for a nice surprise for a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren refreshed his powder blue UCLA uniform and ready for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - Actor; And quite a few people simply play themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: A connection between Harry Gitte's surname, Robert Towne and a particular character in Chinatown and Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> It gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You will see why.
