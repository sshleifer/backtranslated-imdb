I was a little skeptical if I had to see this as it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in NYC the day I went to school at Hunter College. I didn't want to see all the devastation and carnage again, but like many, I was curious to see what it was all about. Tears came to my eyes and looked at this documentary. All my memories are back and just the intense pictures were incredible. I bought the DVD on a year's anniversary and saw it a couple of times. How these guys were able to capture this recording was incredible. If you haven't seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is, of course, depressing and will bring tears to your eyes, but it is an incredible document of this country's darkest hour.
