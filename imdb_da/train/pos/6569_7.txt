"Jake Speed" is a nice movie with a wonderful message. Of course, it has its faults. At times it is a little slow. It introduces its villain too far into history. It acts in step with a snail's heartbeat. It has a Z-grade cast (Although I have always admired Karen Kopin's work, who has the straight line appearance of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all this going against the "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a charming script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find it so inspiring? Because it says to me "Hi, why not try to be a good person." The story is essentially a "stranger in a strange land" premise, it is good and heroic Jake Speed ​​is located in the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, medieval and evil world. <br /> <br /> Because of this, "Jake Speed" really needed to be a hit. It has a great message that should have gone to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. Imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying we should see Waltons in every theater at cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" would get a chance. ("Due South", a TV show on a Canadian Mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten American entertainment.) Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons, but the overall message is, That if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will turn evil forces every time. 14/10/99
