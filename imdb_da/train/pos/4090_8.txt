This movie is simply incredible! I was expecting something completely different from the movie I actually saw. However, it is very insightful that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection with animal behavior. Let me warn them from the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is far too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this movie feels like a high-end kind of pornography. It even has a scene that comes very close to rape. In the meantime, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art". Every minute of the image adds sexual spirit in the seventies, by the way. One should not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> See it! It's worth your money and time!
