When Braveheart first came out, I was excited and admittedly one of the most healthy fans of the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was fascinated, and even though I enjoyed the movie, I didn't think it was a good movie. But as time has passed, my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has fallen. Braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are also shortcomings. The most important, in my view, is the unflattering depiction of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly Scotland's greatest king. Another is the film's historical inaccuracy, which damages the film compared to the many historical distortions. I also think I'm also concerned about the fact that it was in this movie, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginning of Mel Gibson's egoism can be seen clearly for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes I remember most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like good wine, grows more mature and complex with each view.
