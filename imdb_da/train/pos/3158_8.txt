There are too many new styles of sitcom, but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. That 70s is a good example. When the show aired, nobody really heard about Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, much less the youngsters played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from eight, is enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of the actors was never known to us, which is a good thing because a famous member can pamper it. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played her boyfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the compensation couldn't match her and I'm sorry. I liked to cast Tommy Chong as it wasted, but loved Steven Hyde's grandfather. I loved seeing Tanya Roberts in addition to Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. She really showed her actress talent before going to Broadway. This show has been a pleasure with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer, even though 2 of their throwing members leave, but I hope they won't be too far away for too long. I want the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my second favorite program, Third Rock from The Sun, to be more successful at Fox than they were at NBC who sabotaged their show. Turners are not dummies, and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.
