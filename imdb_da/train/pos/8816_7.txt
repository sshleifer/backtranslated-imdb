Given the nature and origin of the 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is, at best, neutral in its attitude towards America. Probably the most 'anti' segment coming from Ken Loach, which definitely does not draw the British New Labor Party Line. Although these events a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans, and most spectators who let them unfold via CNN, etc., most authors and directors choose to show that the tragedy is not a US monopoly. Should anyone be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnia, Chilean, Kurdish (We must continue) Victims. If this was a "wake up call" to the states, it is just as tragic that the Israel / Palestine deathplace in the subsequent 12 months is a solution, while George Bush Jnr. would rather provoke revenge than make the world a safer place. I think many of the contributors are wondering where the idealism of the founding fathers went, and why America originally built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance now sees its self-interest as a whole, while the third world is wondering where the next drink, meal or bullet comes from.
