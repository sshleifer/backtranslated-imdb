Although I really didn't feel like Lance's character and felt that his wife could have done much better with others. It could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance. I would have liked it better. <br /> <br /> However, I fully agree with DoyleLuver when they said "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben:" I'm the star in it, that's right, I'm the talented! "" If you see the movie, just watch him, even when he's in the background ... just his facial expressions, all in the eye, you know exactly what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels about comments, even if it is a quick look behind a character's back. Nice performance in a fair movie.
