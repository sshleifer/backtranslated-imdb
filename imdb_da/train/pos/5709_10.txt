Produced in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We open up a quiet little French village that scans the roofs of the sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. After examining the rebellious, two neighbor men are told the story of two men, allegedly friends who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star in the picture has his number and his friend. When he asks his friend, he will share half of the dough if his ticket is the winning number, his friend says immediately. In fact, H.E. double hockey sticks no! That's the way he's about it. <br /> <br /> So when our husband discovers, he has the winning ticket and that it's lost, without his fault, he's hectic. Everyone is out for himself and is looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to "The Great Race." Although it is all a feedback, I was in no time at all and became so sad in this all-for-me-cash-in-the-bank movie. See Le Million today!
