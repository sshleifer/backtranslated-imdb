I lived in these times and I think the program caught the heart of the era. I think it should have dealt more with the Afro American question, but I think it covers a lot in the program. It was frightening to sit and watch the troubles at TV hoping they would not go as far as the home of your families and that it would not be burned down. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job of exhibiting a vet who came back from the war. I went to school with the guys who came back. Some had changed more than others and some not so much. It bothers me when someone notices that a problem was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough. Live through it and then make comments. I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job. Thanks for a trip (sad and well) down memory lane.
