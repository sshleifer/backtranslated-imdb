FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere of SB. I met a couple of actors who were really good and big in the movie. I saw the trailer so many times that I didn't know what to expect but was totally sucked in. The movie was really beautiful to look at and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a ryan donowho fan, and the dominique swain was also good at it. the other actors were also good good. I hope it comes out soon on DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first entered Ryan from watching the OC and saw him in a bunch of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He's amazing in this movie, and all he does is indie. I also like Dominique, but I haven't seen her as much. Hope to see them both in soon!
