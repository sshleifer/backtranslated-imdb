I liked this movie because it is a true story in the Amazon, part of the world that has always fascinated me. I think a condensed form of the book was published in "Reader's Digest" shortly after the current event. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer", the character and actor are my contemporaries and for this reason I related to the movie. I also think the film is valuable in teaching survival skills, if the viewer observes the sign, follows the currents leading to the river and coastal areas where she can get help, and other survival techniques. The most important thing was her willingness to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers learn something from it and also see it for entertainment. I want the movie to be released in VHS and DVD soon as I want to add it to my video collection. It should also appear more frequently on satellite movie channels.
