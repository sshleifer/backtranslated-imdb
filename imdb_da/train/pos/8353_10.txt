I remember watching this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night as they were the only movie channel that existed. Then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay TV ... especially then. I would love to see it now as an adult, where I would be more inclined to understand the adult theme. It was probably the closest I had ever seen to pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Fortunately, I had stupid babysitters and festive parents on weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the utterly erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into houses to sniff underwear, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus and studying in a cabin at the request of one of their female subjects was just a few of the beaten escapades these guys struck off. A very furious movie for the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had the following. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.
