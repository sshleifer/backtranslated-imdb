It's not so bad that we can be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. With Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best. Get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from ordinary to urban, murder and being murdered - always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a hard-boiled lady avenging and clearing her framed and dead father, a policeman by planning and performing with her coterie a series of underground murders. It would probably have had the opposite effect! Sanders joins in the swoop by just dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time when the right lighting falls on both him and the first killer (at the right time!) And kills him. The story and the play is OK, the only thing I've got is in the end with the hurried and almost ridiculous discovery of who the evil genius (Waldeman) was - did they almost forgot their relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry into the series.
