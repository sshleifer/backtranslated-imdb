The intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of films. It follows its own spirit over time, space and character. There may be a plot, but I understood it from what I downloaded from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve. Honestly, it's probably better to know something about the movie before you see it, because then the viewer can set aside all expectations. The movie requires the viewer to think, but also takes into account the fact that he or she does not get full understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the riddle of the movie. Each picture asks its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, the seer and Louis. Louis' character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required of such a character. Honestly, someone could have played Louis character if he or she had a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. Nevertheless, Subor is the one highlighted here; he becomes the movie, his identity is inseparable from it. Many of the film's pictures that tease in my heart are about his expression, vocal but mostly physical. The intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the silence and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literature in the form it refuses to take. "Surrealistic" has been a term used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasi-realistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the movie exists outside of reality; The simple ubiquitous score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and weak light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer a few times if you are attracted to visual images; watch the movie to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grip on freedom.
