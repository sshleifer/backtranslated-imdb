I didn't know what to exempt, so I thought it was much better that I hadn't excluded much. Don't get my wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and author, so I think she deserves many kudos to make this movie. You can tell that it has been a love for her. The actor (outside Dominic) is a bit cheesy, and the quality of the film is not great either, but for a really low budget film it is good. There were times when the story line coincides, and there are parts that draw on, even though I don't feel it, greatly detracts from one's ability to understand the movie. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say go to it. The gag coil was fun, I didn't want to spoil it, but there is a certain scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can see it again and again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
