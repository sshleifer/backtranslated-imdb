I lost my father at a very young age. So young, actually, that I don't recall him. Over the years I have learned many things about him. One of those things was that he loved western, and seeing Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I remember even the tail end of the series, as I was 8 years old when the show ended production in 1973. By watching this show over the years, I do a little closer to my lost father. It has all the right elements to make a show successful, laughter, tears, the edge of your seat tension, and it has even angered you at times. My most vivid memory of the show's original race came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. A special episode and the end of the final credits flashed a picture of Blocker and faded to black, and I can also remember my eldest sister with a tear in the eye to see this. I remember this as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it himself, we love Bonanza.Long live Cartwrights.
