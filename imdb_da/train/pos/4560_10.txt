I have just returned from a view of "My Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and uplifted. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and based on the author's autobiographical "My Left Foot". Christy was born with some form of cerebral palsy so that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot. Doctors advised his parents, he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother did not give up on him, and as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller, he helped achieve a breakthrough where he learned the alphabet and then to read, write and paint. . <br /> <br /> This film won the Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor) and best entertaining actress for the actress playing his mother; It has also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Instructor and Best Customized Manuscript. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many movies can entertain me, many also leave me often ignoring fictions or unlikely in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this movie - it was totally "spot on" to portray typical Irish parents' roles and behaviors (see, for example, typical Irish families in McGoldrick's "Ethnicity & Family Therapy") as well as Christy Brown's uneven emotional maturation - some immature personality responses that were even more amplified by his father's absorption characteristics. <br /> <br /> The movie presents the greater truth as you change certain sequences in his development (painting and writing) and condensing several important people into a person to tell a coherent, credible story, not burdened by little ones distracting, less important actualities. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy's speech (& some of the Irish speech); the original release of the movie may have lacked this. (If you see this on DVD, enable that option.) <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest, credible, working jobs I've ever seen. Really magnificent, excellent, superlative. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" bears more than any resemblance to a recent movie, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly", each depicting the life of a real person successfully monitoring the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely serious physical disability. <br /> <br /> In this connection, it restores with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" who begins: "Out of the night covering me, // Black as Pit from pole to pole, // I thank whatever gods can be // for my invincible soul.
