This is an extraordinary movie that pulls you constantly. It seems to be heading towards clich√© on several points, and then something amazing happens that really gets going. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick to this movie and you will be really rewarded. William Haines is absolutely lovely - he is definitely a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The homosexuality of his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there's even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's breast (Pickford's cold). Both actors subtly and subtly play this subtitle, so there are moments that move a lot. And I never thought I could get so involved in a football game like I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes it is not quite a gay movie). Wonderfully quiet classic - a good example of 20's commercial cinema with an edge.
