The first thing you encounter when studying fascism is exclusion: because this "philosophy" is a false one, there is a need to use scapegoats to assess "thought" .Ettore Scola's film, probably his masterpiece, focuses on the excluded, scapegoats of the regime. <br /> <br /> Of the historic event (Hitler and Mussolini's alliance) we will hardly see anything: some military marches, some wreaths, some scattered voices. Our two heroes are not invited to party of virility. "Genius is essentially masculine": this is the golden rule Antonietta (a never better Sophia Loren) embroidered on her pillow; Antonietta, whose world amounts to her kitchen, whose pride is her offspring at the beginning of the film, she is a victim of this hypermacho world, but she does not realize it.She thinks she should be happy.Gabriel, on the contrary, is Politically conscious, he knows about the cancer that destroys relentlessly his country.But as a gay man, he is no longer part of what he is being arrested. <br /> <br /> Forget everything that comes between them, they realize what they have in common and they love. It is an act of rebellion, especially for Antonietta, whose ethics should prohibit such a thing. By emerging in a country where politics and religion combine the reproach of women who always lead her to some form of political consciousness. One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio. <br /> <br /> Expect the unexpected and perhaps a doctrine that deni man his intimate personality will see its days numbered.
