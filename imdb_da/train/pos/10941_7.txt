The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show first worried me. The movies she's performed in were not very fun and her humor is a bit gone. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central paper. I could possibly put her in the same way as Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very similar to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. One downfall of this show is its supporting casting. Her sister's character is good; Fun at times, but ultimately did not mean stealing Sarah's show. However, the rest of the casting is extremely sub-pair in comparison. I'm glad that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
