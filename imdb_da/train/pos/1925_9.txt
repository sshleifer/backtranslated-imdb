This should be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment. It takes the sugary idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family, making it a rather realistic but fun depiction of a typical family complete with siblings and parents, brothers and sisters, overprotective fathers and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> For its credit, '8 Simple Rules' knows it's a comedy and not trying to be more. Too many shows (eg, Sister, Sister, and Lizzie McGuire) are just thinking that its protagonists are now teens, so they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humor by being hit too hard. This is a trap '8 simple rules' have avoided; It solves some problems (like being the school's outcasts), but it's fun while doing it. In fact, the only time it really has been serious is understandable when dealing with John Ritter's tragic death and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think that although John Ritter will be missed when he was the reason the show got its mark, '8 Simple Rules' can still do well if it remembers its humor and not makes Cates father another version of Paul Hennessy.
