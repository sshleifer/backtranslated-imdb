Having only seen two of his pictures before, I've told Altman. First of all, I have always felt his style of film making "boring." You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is quite undervalued and very questionable out of print. In fact, I don't think it's ever been issued to VHS. Why? When all these crappy movies get DVD releases daily, is it left without reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was mostly constantly entertaining and fun. Almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle conceptions. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's style at the bottom of the pool halfway is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the mud out there that gets DVD releases. Hell, I would be happy with a good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> It's often on the Fox Movie Channel, but watch out.
