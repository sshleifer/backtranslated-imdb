One of the best Tarzan movies is also one of its most action-packed (and graphic) images. Picking up a year after Tarzan the Ape Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt has asked a rich friend to fund a safari back to the elephant cemetery to gather ivory. His friend also comes with wearing dresses and perfumes, which Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt, his card finds stolen, and it becomes a crazy dash to try to catch a competing expedition. When they finally take the robbers, they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon discover that they are out of the frying pan and in the fire. Immediately Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures. <br /> <br /> Notorious movies were heavily censored to reduce graphic violence (Its graphics even to today's standards. It would probably get a PG 13) and to remove all hint of nudity (there are a few minutes long naked swimming spot involving Jane, who is full frontal in her nudity, it was only recently restored). It is clear to see the restored version, so this movie was reduced by 20 minutes in time for television. As it stands in its restored version, this is a very adult movie that is romantic, touching, action-packed and everything else that a movie should be. It's a great movie with almost any standard. Best of all is the kind of movie that plays well both as an independent adventure, you don't have to watch the first movie to enjoy it, but it is also a movie that immerses the characters and themes created in the original movie. It's a great thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> If there are any errors in the movie, it may be that the movie has not become well-aged. The rear shield is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the monkeys, and some of the other effects are more picturesque than convincing. But at almost all other levels, this movie is at the top. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see this. Make yourself a large bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
