I saw this pilot when it first appeared, and I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans hate it, because like Batman, The Green Hornet, etc., took that character towards "camp." But I have obviously never had enough of Batman because I thought it was entertaining, in some of the same ways it shows. There are two parts that remain with me. First, when Denny's partner has been badly hurt, and he makes a dramatic talk about how he always stood before the law and obeys the exact letter of it. Then he says something like, "Boy, was I stupid!" Which is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the TV Batman type). Then there is the scene where he tries to seduce the scourge of letting him kiss her, but she's not fooled because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a good example of "camp" which was also "underplayed" by both the actor and the actor.
