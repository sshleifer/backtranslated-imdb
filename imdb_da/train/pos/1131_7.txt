This is a really fun movie. One of them you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot is getting more and more twisted more and more fun. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in her day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... It is all these well-known, quality actors that appear to be soap opera stars / producers. If you've ever seen a soap opera and thought, "How have they come to earth with this idea?", Would you love this movie. I've seen it several times; And every time I see it, the more I appreciate humor, the more I realize how well acted it really is. Don't expect Oscar's quality. It's a fun movie to entertain, not an artificial attempt to find "the man's inner man", etc. Sit back, relax and laugh.
