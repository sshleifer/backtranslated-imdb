THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I say it is far more comfortable than the painfully boring and unorthodox Swedish WILDCATS, it is still a little slow and unclear for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is centered around a group of vampire girls living in a castle wishing to revive their formerly murdered "leader". To do so, the girls must dance around naked and kiss each other and cut strange things - and of course also drink some blood. When a doctor and her brother's car break down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they give the ideal blood bank to the horn vampires ... but they can't be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> < BR /> DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of 70's use of sleaze. Lots of nudity - including some completely frontal, some shabby undertones - including incest and of course lesbo blood suction ... but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from something more explicit sex, but I think you can't have it all. Also, would have enjoyed some heavier violence / gore because it is a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was more to show skin, not blood. Still a bit slow - and the play is mostly absolute wood - but one can expect from something from this era and from this budget. Worth looking at exploiting fans - others may find it a little too boring to their liking. 10.7
