A new page for the story of Victoria and Albert was brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most sincere thoughts about Queen Victoria are the woman who ruled for decades and lived her life in grief. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives the audience a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascending to the throne and early years. Blunt Victoria is both fresh and maintained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors rejoice, including Miranda Richardson, in what might have been a cast. <br /> <br /> Although not a story of dramatic arches and histrionic "actor" moments, history is still interesting enough to make it worth seeing. There are a few historical freedoms taken from screenwriting, and the film seeks to be true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the era. The set design and costumes are excellent. <br /> <br /> This movie will be appreciated most by those drawn to history, period drama, and by Blunt and the other actors. Warmly recommend. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
