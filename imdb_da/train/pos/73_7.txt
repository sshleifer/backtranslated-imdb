This is essentially a variation on House Of Wax in both the plot and the type of role of the star of both films, Vincent Price.In both pictures, he plays a talented artist who is sent tumbling over the edge in silence, when his creations are usurped by other, less talented and less meticulous people. In this film, he plays an illusionist for stage selectors who strive to embark on an executive career alone to become frustrated when another illusionist, Great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists he honors his contract and gives him the first choice illusions he designs. The prize is already badly allocated to Rinaldi, as his former wife is now a paramurre of Rinaldi. He exploits his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant imitation to avenge himself at Rinaldi and others who oppose his recognition plans as an artist and designer. The prize is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well-judged star turn as a wrong man whose love serves the public's sympathy. The rest of the throw is competent if colorless and the weight of the entire venture falls on Price, which bears the burden with ease. <br /> <br /> Good solid B Movie melodrama, this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is fun so you don't expect a masterpiece. Shots in black and white are low on gore and are best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for its presence star gives an idiosyncratic performance
