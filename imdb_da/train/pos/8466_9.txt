As TALK RADIO, the BOOT is actually a bit predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth about what happened in the BOOT because of - let's see it - the genre and the basic setup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. It essentially means that the filmmakers do not elaborate at the end of the way they might have, says an American version of this story. BOOTH relentlessly moves towards its (foregone) conclusion, but is so beautifully crafted at all levels that you can enjoy the trip, as you can know a good cruise along a well-visited stretch of (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky short story, FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. Worth to have a good long look.
