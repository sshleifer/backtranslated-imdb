Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life too seriously !!! Watch this movie for what it is, sit back, relax and get a giggle. The film does not take itself seriously, so we must not. If you like James Belushi, you will like this movie. If he's not your cup of tea - give it a miss. <br /> <br /> I like James Belushi so I liked this movie. So simple is it? :-)
