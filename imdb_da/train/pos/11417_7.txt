This movie hit me as a project that had many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way, where they didn't quite come together. I don't know who made it, but it has a slightly disney-esque feel. While parts of it are unlikely (like when a pre-teen runs to a public office) and tends to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever it is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. The action is okay. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. It is interesting to see how she should work hard to balance her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player herself, it was quite painful to see Frankie trying to keep herself on a team of boys, but doing a good job of showing the match she is meeting. I read a place that she is not really ballerina, but editing in this movie did a very good job of making her dance look not only natural but beautiful. All in all, it was a good movie about honesty and ambition, but the star Mischa Barton did not quite achieve the level of realism we experienced during her performances in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious" and her small but shocking performance Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense."
