Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did, "Strange Case" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any changes could be made. There are some stupid ideas through and even a few clever, but the story as a whole is unfortunately not too much. Arthur Lowe, however, is a hoot as Dr. Watson, bionic bits and everything. "Good God."
