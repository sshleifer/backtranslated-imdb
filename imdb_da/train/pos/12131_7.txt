The film is concerned about Philip (Leslie Howard). He is a serious but disabled medical student. He falls in love with a heartless predator named Mildred (Bette Davis). She leaves him, engages with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is romantic with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and first of many movie versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the cockney cruel waitress wins another magnificent interpretation with an amazing and smoldering performance, quite hypnotic in her account of the bondage that arises from the beginning to the final. Davis rose the star with her performance. Her role as hard and raw dominant woman will be repeated several times in posterior trades. Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholy performance. He was a great actor (joined the wind) in addition to producer and writer and death in the second world war flight. Both will play again in Â¨Petrified forest '(1936). The atmosphere film is carefully recreated in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio is quite convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The movie likes classic cinema buffers. Rating: Very good, but a little dated.
