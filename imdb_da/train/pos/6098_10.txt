This is a horror movie-based television show that gets it right. Friday the 13th, the series was not connected to the films. Poltergeist Heritage: I'm not so sure. It may have been loosely connected to the movies. It feels like they are just throwing a famous title on a show, so fans will see it. <br /> <br /> It shows that Freddy is being burned by the Elm street parents (in the first episode I think) and the amount of parents was disappointing. With all the children, he focused on the 1. 3 movies that one would expect there were more parents. But so good. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the narrator of the show. He looks at actions from people in the real world, sometimes getting involved in some way. Just as other anthologies appear as Tales from the crypt, there is a supernatural or surprising end twist involved. <br /> <br /> The action is lacking but believe it or not: the violence sometimes goes beyond the film. This show lasted a few seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. I heard it was canceled because of protesting parents. I saw many R-rated things as a child, so it was a shame that parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
