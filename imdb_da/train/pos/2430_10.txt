This a Casper the friendly Ghost card from my childhood and I see it again on YouTube (thank God! For you tube); after that i love this card and it is one of my favorite casper shorts. <br /> <br /> I love how the short begins to be scary with Frank Gallop's joking story; until we get to see Casper sitting at his gravestone in the cemetery and reading. While each ghost rose from the tomb to "boo" people, Casper decides to leave in search of a friend. But in trying to make a friend, everyone who sees Casper runs away. Bad Casper was sitting on a log and crying; until a little fox cub comes up a key to him. Casper and the little fox tie fast and he quickly names the cub Ferdie and considers him to be his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie's relationship is in great danger, but when Casper does not watch Ferdie while playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie saves a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie, and Ferdie runs as fast as possible until he is breathing and begins to pan. While the hunter shoots shot at Ferdie Casper, they notice that they are killing him and flying in the hunter's direction and asking for the hunter to leave Ferdie alone. And the hunter and the dogs are afraid of Casper. Casper shouts to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees that Ferdie's body doesn't move and asks if he's okay. When Casper sees that Ferdie is dead, he begins to cause pain because he lost "the only friend he ever had throughout his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and made a headstone for him next to Casper's tomb. Casper continues to provide pain until he sees that Ferdie is resurrected as a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. Casper screams of joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a really good card; However, surprisingly disturbing, death shows in a family-oriented cartoon.
