Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie and I guarantee you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 min. And at that time there was hardly a moment when I didn't laugh. You will laugh for hours after it's over and play the battle lines over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many fun performances during his career (48 Hrs., Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming to America, Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far his most HILARIOUS moment. I've seen this movie so many times and it's more fun every time. It never loses its edge. From this day forward, every great stand up performance will be emulated from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
