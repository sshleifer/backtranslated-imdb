If Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of the Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz is dead. Like Tom Stoppard's event film, we will see the action from a viewpoint of two of the smaller characters from the original: Timon, Meerkat with a penchant for breaking into the song of a drop, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simbas - we see why all the animals bowed down when Simba was presented by Pride Rock. We find out what Timon and Pumbaa have chosen to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to avert Scar. And we find out how they treated the hyena's course for everyone. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is strongly supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It's also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg replay their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only drawback is the constant stop-start-spooling-fast-forward device that doesn't always help speed up the story. That said, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more fun than any other movie in the third movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if it's just for the hot tub scene that's still fun, even if it's a little predictable.
