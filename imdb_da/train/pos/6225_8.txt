This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise, and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual, as two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard, where the rest is divided and / or shared between those responsible. As usual, the story does not have to hold us back, even though it was based on a game of Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theater may have been a little confused, inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie, but that always means that music, lyrics and heads are completely out of the right bottle. It is a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we are going to see the Astaire playing the piano - in fact he was a successful pianist and composed several songs, of which I build up to a horrible light-down, had a lyric of Johnny Mercer spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it's the only one of those series where he played a service man, albeit an ex-hoofer who joined the fleet after being dumped by dance partner Ginger before the story begins. He gets to perform a little known but excellent Berlin number, I would rather lead a band as well as duet that I put all my eggs in a basket, but the ultimate figure is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II was already felt - Let's see music and dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team. So what if Randolph Scott is a small tree and fish out of water without a horse or six weapons within reach, and Harriet Hilliard does not completely fire the screen we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, they deliver . Answer: You save.
