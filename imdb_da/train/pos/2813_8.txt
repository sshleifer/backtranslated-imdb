This is a complex documentary showing many things about early gay life. To put it in perspective, it was when Gay was the word used for the gay sexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today? I think most of the film comes from around 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993 so it has existed. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentaries that caught a man's love for another over a little bit odd year. A love expressed in ways that only true love can be. There are many scenes with incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as gay-sexual and life as gay. The movie itself was a love work, and I think it's a diamond. At least one gets out of this movie an understanding of AIDS's devastating effect. When I write this I think how much earlier this movie seems to have been put. The advances in medical, political and social science and culture that have taken place since this film was set (about 15 years ago) are amazing. But of course, in the case of the AIDS disease itself has not yet been done. Heck I suppose we are not finished on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a beautiful darn good documentary. I want to encourage anyone who feels they do not fully understand gay life, gay problems or AIDS destruction to see this movie.
