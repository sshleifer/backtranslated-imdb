I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw this. But after seeing it, I understood what a funny man he is. This HBO special features he teaches "American history" to New York University's film students and the man was just phenomenal. He encountered fun at almost every important historical event that not only took place in the United States, but also in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that questioned me as to what I accept as the infallible true story is truly true. I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning much more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and willing to question what his / her beliefs are.
