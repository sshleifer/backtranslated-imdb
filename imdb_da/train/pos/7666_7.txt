Two wizardry battles in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as a solitaire) trying to destroy the earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save it. "Doctor Mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy fare that offers lots of cheese. The plot is pretty stupid and gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill, give this a look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
