What people do not understand about this movie is that it is not a beginning, middle and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode television series. So remember that when you all talk about how the world was not explored enough. It was all in the TV show. <br /> <br /> So great and stunning as the pictures, I believe that *** SPOILERS *** the argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo at the end of the movie was what made me really love this movie. Seeing signs I had followed through 26 episodes fought like that, became agonizing, and when Gwizdo unfortunately went outside himself in the midst of the floating ruins, while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade, it was almost tear. <br /> <br /> Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these crazy amazing dragons (which had previously been characterized by the series), while Gwizdo bubbles insanely and indirectly threatens to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene has not been mentioned any more in the warnings. Any child who has a sense of passion will be able to see that Gwizdo was not herself and was intent on strangling the little girl. It was enough to disturb me, and I'm 15. The world is great, the plot is much better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a great way to see some of my favorite people go. Check it out. :)
