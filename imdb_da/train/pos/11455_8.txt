This German documentary, in English, is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example, we see early in the film that he takes parts of ice particles and "glues" them with some moisture in a serpentine form, which apparently repeatedly passes through a vertical stone. ice cream melts, but this transience is part of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and gets a feel for it, and intuitively decides what to do that day. He talks about having a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with, trying to work * with * rather than against them. It can be stone, or flowers or leaves or sticks. The sculpture can last for minutes or years, or may not even last long enough to be completed and photographed. The work seems to be more of a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The film and work are beautiful, inspiring and thoughtful. It moves quite slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you must be sure to go when you have had a good night's sleep. But go if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the Internet for some other sites about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find out what this movie means to you completely independently. I remember a few ideas that arose for me as you watched the movie, which I thought I would share for those of you still reading. First, the transcendent nature of many of Andy Goldsworthy's reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live, and eventually we die. It is natural, and that is of course part of Goldsworthy's art. The second way of thinking was to be confused with the way Goldsworthy managed to integrate his passion and work so thoroughly into his life. Most of us have work that at best is tolerated, a life that we hardly experience, and passions that we really mean to spend more time if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create a blend of all those aspects of his life that seem to work very well and nurture him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Set on 8/28/2002.
