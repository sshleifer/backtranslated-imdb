Vampires, sexy guys, weapons and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child delivers it all in a neatly packed flick! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who turns to a Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows with time, but as Sho ages Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. It is a moving story mature with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh and cry a little more. Although you are not a fan of their music, SEE THIS MOVIE. It works well as a stand-alone vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
