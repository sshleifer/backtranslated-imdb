This is by far one of my favorites of American Pie Spin offs, because in most of the others, the protagonist (one of the young stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chickens and has a particular threat on his track to rid him of his virgin "problem" and he ends up stopping in the middle and riding a horse back to sleep with his boyfriend holding in mind he gave him a "guilt-free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of it all, but let's be realistic; Most people who watch these movies are not looking for a romantic story. The latest submission finally seems to realize who the audience is, and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell roses and as always lends Mr. Levenstein's "completely natural" eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
