This movie is about a dysfunctional family, but not just a dysfunctional family. It's about the family of our nation (India), although the film focuses primarily on the alien relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get close, Mahatma would come between them. This is a beautifully finished film. Akshaye Khanna has proven to be a top actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who mainly stars in Plays-Gurukant Desai's lawyer in Guru, has portrayed Gandhi wonderfully. (As a real man, unlike Ben Kingsley, who made him look like a God), the Shefali Shah girl from Monsoon Wedding has also done a great job showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film touches and then the sound track "Raghupati Raghava" is sung in a very unique way. I watched this movie just 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai one day earlier - the 2nd) and when the movie was over there was "Pin Drop Silence" and while you left the Theater, someone didn't push someone else (can you imagine you us indians do not push?) not one! There was a sacred silence ...
