Scorpio's tail is a very stylish giallo directed by Sergio Martino, who appears to be a Giallo champion second only to Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this amazing, white dunnit, quite complicated, but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, for it is not always the case for these giallo's, as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herring and ultimate solutions. Here the less you know about the plot, the better. The pure gigallo brands present here are the beautiful film, the captivating music score, the beautiful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murder, black gloved killers and explicit sex scenes to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most parts it is decent act, Goerge Hilton his usually suave himself and others do it pretty well. Martino manages with a safe hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some amazing sets. <br /> <br /> If you are a giallo fan, this is a must see. If you like well-written and exciting thrillers in general, it is highly recommended.
