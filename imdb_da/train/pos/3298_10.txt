This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen - it has it all - a really moving manuscript, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to look at, an actually elegant romance (it's a shame that romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you live in them. The end was only a disappointment because I was expecting a spectacular movie to have a brilliant end - but it was even more wonderful than the vast majority of movies out there. Check this movie for sure again and again. There are many details you miss the first time that deserves a different look.
