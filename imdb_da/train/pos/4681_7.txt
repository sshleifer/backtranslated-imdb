All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> But I really want to notice the similarities between parts of this movie and Nichols' Closer. One scene, especially where Adrian Grenier's character asks Rosario Dawson about his sex life while he was away, remarkably resembles the scene in Closer, where Clive Owen's character asks Julia Roberts, although it is acting with less hardness and intensity in "Love." Also note that "Anna" is the name of both Dawson and Robert's character. Can't be coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's game and probably this movie is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how this connection formed. <br /> <br /> Anyone has an idea?
