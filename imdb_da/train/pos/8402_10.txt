THE VAN is a simple tea flotation image that is made specifically for the drive that goes beyond what makes you feel comfortable and offers many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small yet ample role as head of a car wash and almost steals the show! All the conductors are well-behaved, the characterized complexes and the controls are quite competent for this type of image. A Crown International Release.
