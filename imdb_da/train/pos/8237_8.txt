For my life, why did this movie get an R-rating?! While it is about carnivorous zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly movie - at least if your kids are 10 years old and older. Unlike the traditional zombie films, this has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- albeit slightly twisted! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the movie style is certainly aimed at children (like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - but some knucklehead hit an R rating one! Believe me, most children have seen worse violence than this, and it just seems silly to get the audience to believe it is an adult only movie. The story is set in a parallel-type world. While fashion, cars and mores appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there has been a hard recent zombie plague that resulted in the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. In school, the children are trained in armed struggle, and there is a cute scene late in the movie where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep it in the backpack "just in case"! As for life outside school, it is also quite strange that people have now learned that zombies are not that bad! Heck, by means of collars and training, they can be made slaves who can do your housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This movie deals with a particular family who finally buy their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son is slowly zombies, but Father is not convinced - when he was forced years too early to kill his own zombie father and he has not yet come across this !! Fun, uncomfortable and unique - this movie should be seen by a much wider audience.
