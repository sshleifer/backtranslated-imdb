This is not Bela Lago's best movie, but it has a good old-fashioned style for 40 years of scare entertainment. Brides fall dead on the altar like flies. I think I'll postpone the wedding until after the enemy is caught, but it's a horror movie, so I think people are ignoring the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a sour doctor who needs young female blood to keep her aging, sick wife healthy and happy. He always removes Keystone Cops by storing the bodies in an armchair (who would think of looking for a corpse in a chain?), And the brides continue to be zapped. <br /> <br /> No movie like this would be complete without a Lois Lane type female reporter wanting to catch criminals alone. Good at solving crime, badly keeping her mouth closed at all the wrong times, guessing who Lagosi chooses for her next scheduled victim. I love the "haunted house" bit where Lois Lane is stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at Lagosi's outrageous mansion. Hidden passages, a vampire-like wife, an evil dwarf Igor assistant and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> Fair pacing keeps the movie moving, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this is worth a watch.
