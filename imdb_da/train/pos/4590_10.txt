Perhaps the film itself is not one of the best Jackie Chans movies, but I think that everyone will agree with me that the template game was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There were also some memorable stunts that were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie has influenced many other action movies, and I think action movie producers today will learn from this movie (as if they could recreate the hunting scene, with modern technologies I could do even better). There were also some fun scenes that made this movie fun, though Jackie didn't fight. Althou think I could put more fighting scenes in this movie.
