I hate to read reviews that say something like, 'Don't waste your time, this movie stinks on ice.' It still makes the reviewer for me, it can have some kind of naive charm. If you like the other 'Whistler' series movies, this will be visible. If you like 40's noirish movies, this will be visible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is not as good as any of the previous serial entries such as star Richard Dix as the protagonist. It is much slower and the plot is thin. You've seen the same narrative device used in many other movies, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the play is good, and that's also the lighting and dialogue. It only lacks energy and you will probably find out what is going on and how it all comes out in the end, not more than a quarter of the way through. <br /> <br /> The "Whistler" series is semi-noir, with character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles more important than the story itself. But this movie is not noir. It's too easy and Hollywood innocent of it. Neither Richard Dix's character nor any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end. You never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this to at least one view. I've seen it at least twice myself and got a fair pleasure out of it both times.
