Here Italy (I'm writing from Venice). Why canceled? ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience. Cast (Scott Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent years. We need more shows like this, which makes viewers want to be intelligent individuals who are not funny drones. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
