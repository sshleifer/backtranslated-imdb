I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is pretty bad, sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the little known movies that only plays once on television and even seems to disappear in thin air. I looked through my old VHS video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, it's pretty decent. I have to admit that it is a very well composed film and therefore I am confused. This is the only movie made by this director ...? How did he not come up with lots of movies after this pretty good? Anyone with so much potential must be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> Anyway, I'd really like to see him pull his action together and make another good movie like this , thanks .....?
