You know, when you look at this Brian DePalma movie today, I am sure there has been criticism of how dated it is. Also about the violence. When I watched this movie on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was too violent and gritty. But I didn't get it. <br /> <br /> A few decades go and man how I know how much I didn't get in this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent movie that was made back in the 30s / 40s. How can you improve a classic? You do not. But you tell a story that is being updated through the "new immigrants" eyes during the most greedy red decade of the abandoned 80s. DePalma, Stone and the band present an ambitious, disturbing and darn really good movie. <br /> <br /> Yes .... Disco was dying and New Wave / Punk took over, but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, that was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were .. by having lots of money and to get the money, you had to take over a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was great to me as Tony Montana, the "little train that could." What a great way to get your protagonist to look at America: to fight, kill, steal. lying, cheating everyone to get - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it to live it and in his circle nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the "f" word, but what do you expect, Emily Post's post-school for him and his cohorts? Look at how they came to America, what they knew what they were exposed to. How chose Tony and his crew to "be all they can be in America." It was about power. Tony Montana wanted and did something to achieve it ... it is all violent, lying, stealing, crooked, and twentieth glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that personified the 1980s for me is money laundering. Tony's crew brings drugs money bags to the bank. Did they care about Tony and his crew? At the clubs where he used and drank? Nix. Money was money and with money you get the power. Tony lived high off the pig. He and his beautiful blonde American trophy he married played by Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana's rise to power, he finds out what's really crappy up there. He's in doubt, he's a drug addict, he's paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to take him in a bloody takeover, his trophy 80's American blonde drug-abused wife he finds out is a bore he has to hold on top of his empire because ... he goes down. And down he goes in a terrible violent way, but again I ask what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the quintessential 1980 movie that tells you an odd story about how some misunderstand the American dream ... for occupation. It's violent, bloody, too so .. but it runs the point disturbing home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba, who landed in Florida in the 80s, was something like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the display of how miserable the 1980s was with focus on greed and money as the only measures in the United States to be "somebody" and have power took its tool for these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Do you wonder - have anything from then - been taught today?
