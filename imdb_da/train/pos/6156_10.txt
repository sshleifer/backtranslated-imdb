This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. So on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th section of this movie DVD. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so big it has an extra 30 minutes that the original did not have. I didn't know that when I first started to see. The film has ever been made much more since. The music they cut out should have been left behind. You haven't watched this movie until you've seen Full 131 my version. Many say the music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie of the heart, each song has its own charm of itself and comes together as a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the "Eglantine" song stuck in the head for days at a time. As well as "Briny Sea" (the song was meant to marry the popcorn but was cut out of the movie) Please see the new uncut 30th aniversy film and re-vote for this movie. the 10 that it really is.
