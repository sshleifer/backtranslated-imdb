I resisted watching this movie and I understand why it wasn't a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks oh so well known. And it is. All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films - and possibly even better. But despite being known and resilient to all Hollywood formulas, this movie is winning and sympathetic at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey in the heart, mind and soul. Like the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood on top of their flat roof, hoping it would start their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle.") Sputnik has a similar influence on the young rocket boys of this true story. While throwing cities in their 1950s town hall rejects the event, Homer Hickham Sputnik sees his ticket out of a life in mines. <br /> <br /> Mastery direction and casting make the journey to rocket kid Homer and his friends seem fresh and new. Particularly affecting are subgroups regarding Homer's starving young schoolteacher. Remarkable restraint is shown in the depiction of their delicate conditions. Also remarkable is the father / son who anchors the film. Perfect game around. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without clich√© or burglary. Her ultimatum for her husband is both worthy and heat-breaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A big video chain I despise has a sign next to this movie that says you will love this movie or they will refund your money. For once I agree with them. You will never look at the October sky completely the same again. <br /> <br />
