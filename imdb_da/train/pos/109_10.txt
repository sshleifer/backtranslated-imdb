This is the movie for those who believe the cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere in post-war Germany completely captivating. You are absorbed in the dream and you only get to go into the final credits. The reason necessarily comes second, but it is still an exciting story where tough problems arise. Just wonderful.
