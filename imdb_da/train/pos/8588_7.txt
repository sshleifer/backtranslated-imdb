It may not be the best movie from 2006, but it was just a movie to tense and think about. Sentinel is a good political thriller movie that resembles or even lends some elements from other political thriller films such as In The Line of Fire and The Manchurian Candidate. The basic plot of this movie looks like other movies like this: A plot to kill the US president. Michael Douglas stars as Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison, who spies the operation only to find out later that he has been framed. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, a rookie agent led by agent Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this movie could have been more action, as some sources consider as much an action movie as a Thriller movie, but a good thing about this movie is instead of just a murder scene to kill the US president, also relates to a mole (traitor) in the secret service leading the president in the wrong direction.
