I caught a bit of this concert on the public television and knew I had to. The boys give everyone at Royal Albert an excellent, often exciting performance that is complete in every way. Clean too - no synth, no lacerated lasers and strobes, no grandiose entrance (and an untouched, serious and grateful audience who all left their bottle caps at home). <br /> <br /> If you are a Cream fan (or if you've only heard of them); if you are a blues fan if you are a rock'n'roll fan; You will not be disappointed when you watch and listen to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It is too good and too replayable; You will keep it within reach.
