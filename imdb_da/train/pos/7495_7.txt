Dwight Frye steals the show in this as a stupid young man (who seems to be mentally handicapped) who is blamed on vampire-like murders, especially after revealing his love of bats that he likes to beat and give to unsuspecting friends like ' presents !. Besides all that, there is an entertaining mystery that involves the above murders. Underestimated.
