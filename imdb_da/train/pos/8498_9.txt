This is a wonderful movie with a fun, smart story and the dynamics of cultural differences and the ongoing theme of what's important in life, making this a very underrated movie. Don't let the cynics in the world deter you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments, and I wonder that comedy is never appreciated because actors like Keaton make it from humor to serious bits look incredibly easy. Amazing movie around!
