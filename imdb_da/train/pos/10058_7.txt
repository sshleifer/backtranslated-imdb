I admit to being a little abandoned by the movie genre of a small child who softens the heart of his reluctant guardian. I've seen enough of them ?? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a boy, mostly Martha, and to some extent Whale Rider ?? to expect to be bored with the formula. What my attention was in The King of Masks was the grimness: small town of China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless for poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to who would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his bought grandchild as he is called "Doggie", he is a grandson, initially throwing her out, even though she has shown a great promise as a street heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he is not so worried when she is kidnapped. The movie is greedy and shows the lengths that a young, street-smart girl might have to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> The two leading performances are credible and demanding in their societal context. In a Western society, at least one would expect a hint of anger with Wang as he had not achieved more material success. Wang accepts as thoroughly his station as a famous low-status artist, but I did too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspected in a modern suburban child, it is entirely credible in the context of a child constantly in a state of survival in a society that treats bad girls as garbage. And having learned that her former seven owners physically and mentally abused her, her hard affiliation with Wang makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> Look at the small town life of a foreign country, the nature of the two leaders actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming solution contributes to a very sober movie.
