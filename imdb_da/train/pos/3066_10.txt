Everyone loves or hates this movie. I'm going to love. It is so well shot and so well acted. Beautiful. This film is for people who greatly appreciate well-crafted filmmaking. If you are not a fan of well-finished movies of course, you would hate this. But if you like tops of acting, photography, history and development, look no further here.
