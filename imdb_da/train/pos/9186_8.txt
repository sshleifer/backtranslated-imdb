Troop men's leaf photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with great intensity by Michael Callan) has horrible nightmares where he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start to die for real, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman tells the exciting story at a steady pace, builds a sensible excitement, delivers a few gruesome effective moments of wildly misogynistic violence (a woman who has a plastic bag with a rattlesnake in the top-of-the-head rates as the decisive disturbing emphasis), puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true to life-style people. In addition, everything is justified in a credible everyday life and spans with a good smattering of tasty female nudity. The fine appearing from an excellent cast helps very much: Joanna Pettet as sunny, charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien's worried psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as gutsy murder detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a political chief and Misty Rowe as a sweet, bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished film image makes impressive occasional use of stunning panoramic images. Jack Goga's creepy rattling score does the same. Popping up in cool chunks is Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland as a scary hooker, Kathy Shower as a hard female wrestler B.J. Grapples with the ring and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles. A solid and comfortable image.
