Haven't seen the movie since its first release, but it was memorable. Performances by Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were excellent, photography excellent, moving history line and everything else it was of the highest standard. But it seems to have been pretty forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market for it, but I haven't seen the movie on TV or video, which is sad. Has it had more success in the US, where it could rightly be seen as a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always believe that 50% of a good movie is the music, and although I'm not sure, I think the title theme was a simple but fluid clarinet solo of "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" . The movie then proceeded to disprove it! I'm right or wrong
