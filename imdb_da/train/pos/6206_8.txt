I admire Hal Hartley's movie, especially 1997's "Henry Fool." "Fay Grim" is a sequel to that movie and has a similar style and sense of humor. However, the reason is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) is trying to track down her missing husband's notebooks and find herself in the form of conspiracies and espionage. The support aids (most of the people from the first movie as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and a very welcome return from 90-year-old resident Elina Lowensohn) are excellent and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of a "Star Wars" -like trilogy that acts as "Empire Strikes Back" in the series. If this is true, I can't wait to see the third installment! I just hope I don't have to wait ten years for it.
