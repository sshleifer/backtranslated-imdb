The last season of Roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy. This last episode just does what a previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the signs we didn't. Roseanne comes back to season one and tells us that this show has been her rendering of her life. She says in this last episode that she changed events and people she considers appropriate. Scott wasn't really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As events happened in her life, she changed them in her writing. We do not all want us to do that. We do not all have a moment in time as we wish we could just use an eraser and switch to our taste. This is what she did with the whole episode. And to another comment I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was genuine in my mind, she just changed the way events happened in their lives. An A + ends in an A + show !!!!
