This movie is amazingly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art truly enjoys the movie's medium because you can see the art of its most beautiful, moving and changing and flourishing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I can't think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you have to see because it's so visually convincing and left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
