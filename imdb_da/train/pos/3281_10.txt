Who would have thought that such a fuzzy little movie could be so joking and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a shame that more people haven't seen it. I always loved Hans Zimmer's score. And what a direct debut by Bernard Rose! But I wonder if I should call this a horror movie. It could easily be argued that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, no matter what I love the interpretation options it has. Everything and everyone in Anna's (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the field, the lighthouse, etc. These are the many details like those that make the movie so good at repetitive views. I hope I come across another little movie filled with emotion and psychological meaning like this one soon.
