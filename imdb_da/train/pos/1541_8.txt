Just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and trustworthy interaction between the cast and the great comic timing too. <br /> This movie touches on topics that are universal family and separation. As a result, I can see European, Asian and American audiences all find points of equality between this movie and their own life. <br /> <br /> If not, this potential has the best underground movie of the year ... someone distributes this in the United States, thank you! <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you Maria Flom! It's really a good movie.
