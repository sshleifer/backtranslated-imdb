I watched this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after approx. 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both worlds of conflict simultaneously. The dilemma that the emotions entailed. The movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and anger bring one of the lovers to an extremist side! an absolute must see !!
