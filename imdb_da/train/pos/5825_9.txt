Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best Stooges short bar none and they are right. The curl is a scream dressed in a row as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in top form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto" respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful operatic voice gets full clothing - she was actually trained opera singer - and that's wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer, terrorized by Stooges at a social party. Some really fun gags, good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the top of Stooges' productive production. What is even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at that time, and in several of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is obviously ill; his timing is far away, he speaks very slowly and lame and has difficulty getting around. Fortunately, his health was in a recovery when he made this movie and it shows. Classic Stooge comedy, and enjoyed even non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who couldn't stand Stooges, but even she laughed at this). A must-see.
