And therefore, historical / biographical films are so important to us all, moreover, when they are as well finished as this one! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but eventually I got a lot more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is simply amazing as Victoria (who would guess it!) and she will probably get a nomination this year Oscars. Personally, I am looking forward to her ... For technical problems, it is gratifying to say that it is a very successful production with wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and of course as it was expected to be a fantastic periodic costume design! <br /> <br /> The one drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but above all incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
