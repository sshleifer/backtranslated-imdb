this was one of the $ .50 cents offers of yore --- and much more complex than most realize --- and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, versus crap as 'earth vs the flying saucers' --- the real 'killer' is the 'universality of the plot' --- everything is linked to two principles --- the old concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking the father's desire for his daughter and the idea of ​​what would happen if a world's tech reaches the point where all the citizens' wishes become apparent. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if all of us wanted death to be dead, not many if anyone is left --- and it became the fate of the "banned" planet of the population --- rather modern , actually. Unfortunately, the "Krellens" gear, which is wasted by ignorance, remains, and Morpheus, the incarnate father, by accessing such technology, and so does to prevent losing his daughter to another. old plot, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> And considering its age, it remains a great excitement, action, human feeling classic --- and visually very modern --- don't pass this one up - -It's all modern sci-fi --- and its psychological content raises it beyond any genre --- a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and the sound tractor! you will see / hear no pure 'synth' and perfectly syched moog background --- a 'not miss' ---
