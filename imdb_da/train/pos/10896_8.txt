At first, I did not think that Ben Affleck could really pull out a funny Christmas movie, boy was I wrong, my daughter invited me to see this with her, and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was fun, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the story is what really sold me, I mean, also put up with the family, at the table for people you hardly ever see but once or twice a year ,, and probably does not go along anyway, you really need as much alcohol as you can stand to handle Christmas so I thought the premise was good there and bought the family with $ 250,000, was a bit on the far-fetched page, but it turned out to work pretty well for me because it was a rebellion all the way through, it shows the class struggle for the different families. It has many fun moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenage boy. All in all, I loved this movie and will see it again next Christmas or earlier if my daughter also wants to.
