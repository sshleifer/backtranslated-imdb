A really cool flick. A must for any music snob. You don't really need to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. All that is required is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film centers around Brian Jonestown Massacre. Dandy Warhols has a role in the film, as "rival band", but they are other hostile to BJM. Dandy Warhols does not play as much role in the movie as I originally guessed, but then again they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability of BJM. You can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic frontman, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is an insight film and studies the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
