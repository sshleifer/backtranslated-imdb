This is a story about Shin-ae moving to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after her husband's random death. Her husband was born here and she opens a piano school, but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from death. If that was how the movie was about, it would probably have been like a Hollywood movie where she fell to a local guy and was happy with her son in their new home. But it's not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because she is known to have cash from the settlement. The sick process, the attempt to move on, trying to clear her sense of conscience, has all been made admirable, and the leading actress is great. The only warning and it must be said is that this is a depressing movie. You need to know it's going in. You want Shin-ae to go through his grief and find some degree of happiness. Again, it is not Hollywood, it is Korea and in Korean movies, especially drama, they do not pull. Life is what happens to you. Great play, but sometimes a hard movie to watch because of going on. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
