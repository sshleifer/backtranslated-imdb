There are many films during World War II, but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them: In this movie we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee ), who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent recruits Major Wirtanen (Goodman) Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the Hitler regime's highest echelons. The deal, however, is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and Campbell thus becomes a hated figure over the United States. After the war he tries to hide his identity, but the past comes back and mocks him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can't do much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... The story is deeply moving as we see Campbell's tragedy, which, although a great patriot, is being dealt with of contempt by all who surround him. Not only that, but also gradually he realizes that even the people who are closest to him have many secrets. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's despair building and almost stifling viewer. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Nolte plays the role of his life; he is even better than in "affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic characters destined for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the entire cast in general. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the book so I can't judge how the movie compares to it. In any case, this is not important: My criticism is on the film itself, and the film deserves wholeheartedly a 9/10.
