LONG FROM SHANGHAI is a proof that the great genius Orson Welles could lead a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. In comparison with his other more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of cunning and almost no esoteric elements. The exception is of course the final scene in the mirror room, broadly agreeing to be one of the greatest scenes in the film's history. It alone is worth the price of a rental. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the stunning spectacle of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her plays at the beginning and the middle of the film are so excellent, she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
