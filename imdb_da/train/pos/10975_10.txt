The daughter's words are poetry: "I can't go in another year. I'll come to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a leaf of leaves." "The marble faun is moving ... he just gave us a washing machine. That's the deal." "I'm powdered by this last thing." ".. pants and cats get a bit boring for a long time." "..what little rat cave, mouse hole, I would like to have better." And there is wisdom in the mother's words: "Yes, that's the joy I am all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, just like a dye." "Always have to do everything right." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I need professional music." "I'm your mother. Remember me?" The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent movie. This is a Mother's Day movie.
