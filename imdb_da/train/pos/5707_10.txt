If you see a Ren√© Clair movie with the kind of distracted semi-attention, which is the rule in TV shows, one can be better at doing something different. <br /> <br /> Watching "Le Million" with all the attention focused on what's going on before the eyes and ears reveals a wealth of lovely details that hold this musical comedy from the beginning to the end with its joy explosion. In the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende a journalist once wrote: "In my younger days I saw a movie that made me want to dance all the way home from the cinema. This movie is on TV tonight - watch it!"
