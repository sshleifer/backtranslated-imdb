There are some spectacular, heart-stopping beautiful photographs here of a variety of nature and animals, from Arctic to tropical and all in between. The camera techniques are varied and range from close-ups to aerial work. Editing is huge and the commentary is also the place with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. Where the movie falls, one tries to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter / hunting interactions across multiple environments. Eventually it becomes a bit bitty and uneven. Overall, worth seeing especially considering the issues that are covered but don't expect Oscar material.
