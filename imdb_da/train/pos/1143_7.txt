I don't see soaps. My grandmother is still looking at one with the hourglass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes parody and tells it in a new way. I found the story pretty amazing fun. Mature in the 80s - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - just top off. The big hair, high heels and histrionics - which combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors are just going to the city, chewing on their parts and spitting them out into a large well-scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - amazing! Robert Downey - Refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before tabloids. And Garry: Why should we wait so long to watch him film? Leesa Gibbons - had not missed her, but nice to include her as a real entertainment rep (and where are you really looking for it?). <br /> <br /> Of course I could have done without Sally climbing the drain pipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? Like any comedienne from Carol Burnett that I don't know who and I are so done with now, I could spit peanuts if I had them. It is apparently what you do when you are having fun in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful that they didn't pull the flagpole bit. <br /> <br /> But it was sweet, it was fun, it had plot twists, it had one after credits that ended before it was ordinary, it had clothes worthy of another look, it had a great cast and It has personal memories for me. Really, what more do you need?
