This documentary on schlockmeister William Castle takes a couple of cheap shots in the naive 50'-60s environment, where he did his most characteristic work - look at the funny, stupid people with the ghost glasses - but it is also loving and lively, with particular bright comments from John Waters who were definitely the target audience for such things at that time and from the castle's daughter who loved her father and also quite conceived of how he wore his craft. (We never find out what became of the other relatives). The films were not as good as it seems, but his marketing of them was brilliant and he seems to have been a sweet, hardworking family. Funny people continue to pop up, like "Straight Jacket" s Diane Baker, who looks good, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced due to star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman, however, explodes into giggles in the good memory of working with Castle at "The Tingler" and there are enough footage to give us an idea of ​​the level of slots talent - not very loud but very energetic. A comfortable look at a time when the audience was more easily satisfied, and it makes you nostalgic for simpler movie days.
