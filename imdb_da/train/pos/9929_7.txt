I very much doubt this movie is based on a true story. In the beginning it is based on a true story, sort of. I bet the only truth is that there was an ex model that bounty hunts might have been named Domino. In any case, it starts with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what she knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through flashbacks we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She is tough, can use any kind of weapon and will use her pretty looks if needed. They get involved in a scam that Clarmont, a rescuer, is on. Along the way, the group begins a reality TV show, and this is where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green get involved. They are like hosts and must have been very desperate to show up in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and it had a little laugh. Editing didn't disturb me. There is also much violence, mainly by means of weapons and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to see.
