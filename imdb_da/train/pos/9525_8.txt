ROAD TO PERDITION can be summarized by Thomas Newman's score. It's scary and beautiful, but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work, and while listening to the soundtrack, you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION reminded of other movies like History unfolds on the screen. As Sullivan runs around America, trying to escape from a psychotic hitman, think of THE GOVERNED, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while guilt and redemption subtitles can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster stereics. Despite the fact that I have seen it all before, it does not feel that this should be taken as a major criticism of Sam Mendes movie, which I repeat, is scary and beautiful, and the only mistakes that work against it are a lot Slow opening for twenty minutes, and I was a little confused as the events that made Michael Sullivan betray. But if you stop thinking about how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg could have done with the story of a father and his twelve-year-old son running for their lives, you can't think of what a fantastic instructor Mendes is <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire casting gives flawless performances. I've never been so keen on Tom Hanks, but he's just as good here as he has been in any major role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no time did I think I saw an American specialty on a false accent - Newman's performance works because of the subtle body language his character tore up, but Newman never milk it or over the top. While never upstaging Newman, giving the best performance in the movie, the two British entertaining actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American mobsters, and while Law still wants a long career as a leading actor, one wonders how Daniel Craig could have evolved as a character actor if he had not decided to become James Bond, a role that celebrates the end of an actor career
