What a real treat and quite unexpected. This is about a real thriller movie. I rushed into the video store, grabbed a movie without reading the whole blurb at the back and hoped for the best. I was totally surprised and happy. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all gave a good performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and corrected. It kept you interested from start to finish and never became boring for a single minute. I highly recommend this movie to those who like thrillers, especially thrillers who are well paced and those who keep your attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.
