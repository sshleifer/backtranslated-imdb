I really liked this movie! Although it was not like any of the books, it is still the classic Nancy Drew style. I had seen many commercials for this movie and when I was really in the Nancy Drew books, I had very high expectations for this movie and they absolutely met the expectations. Almost all characters were exactly how I pictured them from reading the books. I'm really glad I saw this movie. All the actors and actors really reacted like they did in the book series. Ever since I watched this movie, I wanted to read every Nancy Drew book out there. All the actors and actors really got into their characters, and it surely turned out when it aired this movie on the big screen. It was certainly like all actors and actresses were really in the posts that the characters were in. I definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.
