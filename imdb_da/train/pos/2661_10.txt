This is not the first time Stanley blurs the distinction between genres for such a great effect. In Dr. Strangelove had a comedy about a terrible situation, and here is the basis of a scary scenario that actually gives some very funny moments. Slowly burning madness and attempting to kill one's family is not fun of course, but the dialogue is very scientific ("five months of peace is just what I want ...") and there is a great drink scene that would be uneasy if You only included one type of spirit, but are back when you are the factor in the other. I disagree with those who say the hotel has an insignificant effect on Jack Torrance in the movie version. The Nicholson angles give the audience as an actor just a tip on the potential for madness, which is only amplified as we learn that the family leader has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment in which he is, however, absorbs these personality errors and releases them into his consciousness. Just as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on a troubled but eerie man and uses his weaknesses against him to ultimately take him beyond the point of no return. He may have hibernation errors in his personality before he comes, but for me, Overlook is the trigger that puts them off. <br /> <br /> Kubrick is a cold and unstoppable approach to managing works splendidly for a cool horror movie, and the unpredictable power of nature that Jack Nicholson teeters is constantly striving to giggle and scare you out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a good team and with a mix of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great experience, then this is an example that shines well ...
