Yes, it's another great magic Muppet's movie, and I love them all; The characters, movies, TV series episodes (it's the best comedy or musical TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they made such a rare deadly mistake and I am sure about the strange end !! <br /> <br /> It is very dangerous to involve so much in American drama and end a love affair by marriage !! We, like all the poor viewers, feel so free or perhaps happy about the lack of irritation, peevishness and misery! So we enjoy all those stories that bring together 2 sweet heroes as couples in love without the legitimate ties like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess etc. So with all the previous couples and their equals, Feel safe, calm and at peace. Therefore, when you look at what the film makers have already done, you will be as sour as I do! <br /> <br /> They made the weak miserable creature (Kermit) with its daily nightmare, the most demanding female ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change in the actions of the US entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the audience, who just refused to bless or believe or be content with the sudden marriage (even the pathetic lady did not have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide anything!). That's why it's no wonder when you know that this movie is the most flawed in their cinematic serious, and only 25 million over 65 million earned by the first (The Muppet Movie 1979) five years earlier !! <br /> <br /> Only in this movie did they take Manhattan and also my rest!
