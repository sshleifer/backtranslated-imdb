A good movie. The action - from the doctor to the sidewalk artist to the main prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the lesser known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of overactive, presented a credible and well-known character. Another great thing was the camera's work - and the way it captured the bombaygade's energy, the calm of the gusty says his prayers and life in the small apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that turns into a sanctuary and then breaks down - and the artists philosophically take it on. <br /> <br /> Watching good movies on Indian themes is great.
