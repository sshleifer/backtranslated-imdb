Vagually reminiscent of the great 1940s western countries, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story of conscience, greed and fraud. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a down and out but honest young man from Texas who goes west for work and money. He finds both, but not the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The movie's play contains lots of surprises and plot twists. Outstanding filmography, brave movie editing and moody western music add excitement and excitement. The expansiveness of the great heavenly country gives a wonderful setting. And the play ranges from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song gives the film a strong final. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" strikes me as something else too. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and unlikely timing, so much so that others can view the manuscript so mistakenly. Normally I would agree. In this case, but combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and the unlikely timing suggest a story that, in addition to "noirish", is surreal. It's almost as if destiny intentionally interferes with unlikely events to force Michael to tackle himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not at all script errors. They are necessary plot points in a nightmare story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. All we need here is Rod Serling in a copy that explains his always clearly agreed voice that ... a young man searching for himself stops in a small, almost deserted city, a thousand miles from no one places. It's his last farewell to a trip to ... the twilight.
