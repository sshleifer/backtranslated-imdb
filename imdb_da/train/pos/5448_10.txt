This movie is probably my favorite movie all the time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius. The rest of the molding is great and the movie is really great fun. A certain satire of horror movies, with a great twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedy-filled evening, then go and rent this classic. You will laugh all the way through!
