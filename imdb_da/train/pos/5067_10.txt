Here at IMDb.com I read an opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I don't know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but one was really unique. The second thing - the impressive hand of the film director. I give my respect. The silence, the beauty and the spirit of the desert were illustrated very exclusively, I have never met such closeness in any movie before. <br /> <br /> Another thing left in my mind after the movie - this is the movie, closest to the original books and atmosphere of it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respect for the original Gray Owl.
