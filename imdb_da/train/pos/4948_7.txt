This is a beautifully crafted simplistic film that explores a theme, giving each viewer something else that they take from it. The prerequisite is simple: A naming celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to investigate an upcoming role by visiting a store and seeing people. He is particularly interested in the treasurer of "10 Items or Less" lane (Paz Vega), which he finds a gracious, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study. Not a conventional character study; they represent every whole world. The cashier's life is mired in a hard and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so rooted in his fantasy supply that he cannot do simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He readily admits that he puts on a face when talking to people, and the whole point of exploring real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work; we also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and refer to how he inspired them with his film roles. The treasurer's favorite song "Al Pasar la Barca" on how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay (ie, do honest work) for boat passage could not have been chosen better. It is parallel to the Vega character, the only shop assistant with brains or ambitions, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (It's quite an aspiration, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a weird little movie that's probably made on a shoestring. If you don't mind slow pacing and a "talky" approach, this movie will entertain. The characters are perfectly opposite and the effective acting makes them end. A good watch.
