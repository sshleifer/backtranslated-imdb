What does Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and mermaid worship cultures? Tobe Hooper is trying to answer that question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young sweetie who visits her nerdy archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie is hit by a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who serves father on the side. Dad is sent back to the spot where he reveals a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, and falls for a hunky Egyptian (who gives the movie's hottest scenes). Eventually, Genie finds out she must be a victim, and the long and bloody climax begins. Wrapped around this story, footage of the Marquis de Sade is in prison and speaks to a portrait of what looks like Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is great as both Marquis and his descendant. His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue" if you haven't seen it yet. The rest of the casting, including young genius, is beautiful and average. However, the script is problematic. You will soon learn that Marquis's scenes are completely unnecessary, except perhaps the filmmakers had access to the cool set. The mermaid cult, which eventually saves Genie, makes no sense at all. Who the mermaid is never explained and its link to Christianity (which is hyped throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, as the archaeologist is a bible-loving father, but likes to be bound by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had a small idea of ​​what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So why do I recommend this movie? That is strange. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, the hunky Egyptian horse rides a horse completely naked. Englund is marvelous. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of them. This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowledge of Hooper somehow came with "crocodile" after this is quite sad. "Night Terrors" are not perfect, but definitely worth a blinking, invisible look. This is characterized (R) for physical violence, sexual violence, doing, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and substance abuse. <br /> <br />
