Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt separate on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climbs Gabriel Walker (Stallone) back to his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over the cloudy sky, where the weather looks a little threatening, a spectacular uncertain mid-air hijacking goes wrong, and $ 100 million taken from a finance ministry's plan is lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing ?? <br /> <br /> Stranded out of the snow-covered peaks and in need of mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the highly-trained hikers made an emergency call asking for help from a rescue unit ?? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to come together to reach the scene of the crash, unaware that the emergency call was fake and a lot of merciless terrorists are led by a psychotic (John Lithgow ), just waiting for them to find a way out of the stormy mountain with the dumped money cases? <br /> <br /> With magnificent shots, magnificent scenery, dizzying heights, dangerous climbs, freezing temperatures, "Cliffhanger" is certainly Stallone's best action adventure movie ??
