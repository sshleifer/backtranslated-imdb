Crush gives a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I find the English establish very well when it comes to matters of the heart. Best known for managing John McKay, this wonderful three-and-forty-friends play in a small England town. All three professional women out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies evening along with gin, fags and sweet intakes included with endless chats of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell once thrown by the British (who is where I find she radiates the most) is absolutely charming as the main mistress of a prestigious school involved with a younger man. Little boy songs and the jealous jealous friends (great support casting) conflict with her relationship. Exploiting a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when you are in the pursuit of true happiness. Remember the most important prerequisite for this movie is friendships and the end shows us exactly that. This is the type of movie you either love or hate, which is why I believe many mix reviews and not the greatest success resulted when this movie was released. As I am sure, most are just about to finish the movie now. I greatly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend those who like such movies as "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a Funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinarily perfect to capture these crucial moments.
