Of course, if you read my review, you've already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate characters, etc. I love the scene when a stone cracks in Kader Khan's mouth as they eat. Even where Shakti Kapoor tells a corny story about Raja Babu cases on a dining table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. It's my favorite scene in the movie. 'Achcha Pitaji to the Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogs. It is brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors help each other and still take the stage apart. Its total entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry, then it is a must. I think RB is 6. on my list of David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precede this gem of a movie. 10.7.
