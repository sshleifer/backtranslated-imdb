One of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four Atlanta men. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before transforming it into a lake comes from Burt Reynolds Lewis, who unknowingly drowns his fellows in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the movie looks like an action movie, the other half leads to a completely different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, each person will be forced to cope with what was just a quite weekend on the river, but subdued to a struggle to survive. The film (apart from some obvious goofs) is very well-tended and beautifully shot into a natural paradise that steals your breath. The photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all good at showing how a single event can ruin in different ways, four different lives are only linked to the same mistake.
