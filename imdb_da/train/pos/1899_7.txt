Arthur Bach must grow up, but unfortunately he is not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely rich father, Arthur must marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson, or he is cut off from family money (worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur doesn't love Susan (although I hear she does some good chickens) and has just fallen over the waitress and part-time jumper Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. He is really just a big kid, born in wealth with at least one person taking care of him every other day of every day. Work just rub Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, feminine, and of course drink. Drinks give Arthur a kind of Jekyll and Hyde complex; And while it gets him into all sorts of problems, it is absolutely fun to watch the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is amazing here in this movie as Arthur, who earns an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe wins for his achievements. Moore is great with the comic aspects of the movie and makes them already fun lines for unforgettable comic gold, but he is also great at bringing Arthur down to a relative level and making the character comfortable. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, it didn't sprout anyone Arthur can't get enough of, and John Gielgud is great as Arthur's butler Hobson. Gielgud won the best supporting actor Oscar for his performance in this movie, and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a stiff, solid, peat and restrained attitude, but he always looks to Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple but delivers laughs.
