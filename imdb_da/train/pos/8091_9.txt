Peter Jackson's version (s) are better films generally from an objective point of view. That said, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the actors play is just too common and uninspiring with Jackson's LOTR. The whole cast is too run by the mill. "Are you claiming that the stupid cartoon characters in the Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people?" you could ask. Well, they're not really stupid (except Hobbits, later on), and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time. And this is due to the superior _voice_ acting of Bakshi's LOTR. Take e.g. Aragorn. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic with full authority (the Aragorn Lord) and with a spicy rasp (Aragorn Ranger). This is due to John Hurts brilliant voicemail. Compare it with Viggo Mortensen's rather loud sound without soul, and the duel quickly becomes uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen down. <br /> <br /> And then there's Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this Bakshi version, Gandalf (William Squire) is a true guide. And that doesn't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips (he doesn't), but his presence is just captivating. He is a mysterious, powerful and can easily switch from gentle old man to a scary person. In addition, his appearance: Tall, old like the old oak, bearded long as his body, sharp eyes, witch-haired nose and of course the classic witch hat. A perfect Gandalf, like in the books. Ian McKellens Gandalf, on the other hand, is simply too boring. He looks too human, sounds too human, seems too human and has no hatred or no sword at all. Yes, a sword. In this Bakshi version, Gandalf scores some bloody chorus with his sword (as he did in the books). And it's stylish slow motion kills. Gandalf is not a power to be messy with. And it should be noted that although I'm sorry to say this, the great Christopher Lee doesn't bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in this movie did, even with a very limited screen time and lines. Before moving all the way to visual aspects of the movie, it should be noted that the voting and general presencing of Orcs is also superior to Jackson's pretendeous bad guys. Bakshi's orcs are cheating their enemies (or each other) all the time with ditches, screams and ugly languages. They are more trustworthy as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the black riders - or Nazgul. The ultimate villains are scary ghosts in this - not just some riders wearing black. And they are talking with a joking voice that fascinates their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nazgul chases Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders just chasing the party, Bakshi throws a nightmare dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thunder skies. But as much as I like this movie more than Jackson's, the latter is only technically better yet. And that's because of some key images. As you know, Bakshi LOTR has a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and headcasts) and real actors covered in paint. I don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way, but they just don't fit well with traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true for people (Riders of Rohan, taverns, etc.) Orcs are different things, as they have to look very distinctive from other characters. Orcs, while being played by people with animation mix, look much better than Jackson's version. They have brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest turn up in these films' visuals, howerver, is Hobbits. While I prefer almost all characters in the Bakshi version to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, they are actually perfect. With Bakshi you get some annoying and pretty badly drawn humanoid Disney bamboo. And you have to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. Again, the voice action is also okay with them, but the actor's mouth cannot save the "immersion damage" made from these small tissues. Well, I've never really seen those halflings. <br /> <br /> General errors in the Bakshi script are well known. Limited playing time (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So while this movie covers almost half of the story, it doesn't detail it to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In a summary, Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior: <br /> <br /> overall atmosphere (it feels more like Middle-Earth) -Overall voice acting-music (I really dig the imagination from Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of John Hurts finest roles) -Kun Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Errond (He's not an adventure hippie in this!) <br /> <br /> While Jackson- the version is better: <br /> <br /> - because it covers the whole story - overall visual and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> The Rings of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with his well-known missing, is one of the best animated films ever made, and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfect. I give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
