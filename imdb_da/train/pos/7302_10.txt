Following this letter, John Carpenter approaches 'Halloween' the 30th anniversary. It has since created 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween, when they make the 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' lists, it's always there. It's great for a movie that was made on a budget of about $ 300,000 and contained such a virtually unknown cast and come young talent. I could go on, but the big question here is: How to keep the movie up today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Benefits: A simple yet eerie opening circuit sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great filmography. Stellar's direction of Carpenter, which keeps the excitement high, gets some good shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performances from the then most famous cast. A great sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary, evil guy. A lot of scary moments that stay with you. The pace is slow, but stable and never pulls. Unlike most other slasher films, this is more about excitement and terror than blood and a great body count. Disadvantages: Probably not as scary now as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular meaning, but it's really how I feel. In spite of that, it's really an important movie that holds new generations of film films. And just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it's forgotten. No way, no how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
