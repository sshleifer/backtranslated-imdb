A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors like Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of viewing your eyes are locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the movie and wait for what the fate will bring to the characters. This movie makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you in, it makes you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the okiya district is skillfully built. It is certainly not much Akira Kurosawa, but it is still much from the master, especially the stylistic story tells us that we are in a prominent cinema country which is quite far from Hollywood flamboyance.
