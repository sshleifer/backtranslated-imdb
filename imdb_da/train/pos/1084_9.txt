Musings: Pure joy from the beginning to the end. Not a ridiculous uprising, but a more subtle, sophisticated sense of humor. What a gold mine of amazing scenes and actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. <br /> <br /> At the building, Cary Grant views his new home, which is at the time framed. A young carpenter, played by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabid" or something that only carpenters would know. Grant, who does not want to seem ignorant, answers in the affirmative. Then Barker shouts up to his fellow players: "OK boys, he wants the rabble, so .... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear ripping and tearing on about 20 large nails pulled out of different boards. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dated. You will never see many carpenters working at one family house at one time, and somewhere like that in Connecticut at all places would probably run a few million bucks. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is really a treasure.
