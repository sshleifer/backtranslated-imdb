There is such a nonsense on the cable film channels that I hit a gem with this. From the beginning to the end it had made me grab and deserve top marks. Father of two sons hear messages from "God" to kill people whom he is told are "demons." <br /> <br /> Since the opening credits showed the director as one of the casts, there can often be a warning about a bad movie; Exceptionally, it is the reverse here, as drama is non-stop from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> There is no moment in the movie when you are not completely excited as there is no unnecessary or unnecessary subplots and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors give convincing performances, especially the leading children's actor, who is unusual. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as the lull of silence.
