This one is a pretty good surprise. Cute little story of the heroine's quest, very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type in a raunchy DD cup six queen. <br /> <br /> Visually a sight for tender eyes, not just for two amazing actresses, but also for (most) costumes and make-up by the actors. An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous slot imitation. <br /> <br /> Back to positive: The movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera shots that you wouldn't expect in a soft core. Loved the scene with ice, absolutely classic potential. A small minus only for (very) few odd scenes, where poor behavior of less-cast cards suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including an additional credit for the severe drooling effect.
