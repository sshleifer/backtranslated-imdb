Okay, this movie fine as I said, but surely you should see it as a worth seeing. It's about two boys Mac and Sam who are good friends and work as fashion photographers, and the laughter begins when the Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dancing with 3 air guards while his wife is suspicious. Sam gains wealth and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks so, and he starts dancing with air guards. there is garam masala at every step of the movie, songs rock, but somethings are missing. The comedy is not up to the mark and deserves a prize. It's nice, but not so good. Some people laughed at their abdominal pain, but it didn't deserve many laughs. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie, feel free to do so.
