We looked at Vcr and found it to be fascinating. When I didn't know anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (" red "Indian in the movie), which bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film does a good job of demonstrating the value of these indigenous peoples and undermining the racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty, and very convincing as an Indian woman (I think she is French-Canadian, she certainly returns to the all-too-familiar speech). Despite Brosnan's loosening, ugly style, he eventually comes convincingly as a passionate, dedicated man. The reason is a little weak in demostering its transformation from stairs to animal conservation. Good movie, highly recommended.
