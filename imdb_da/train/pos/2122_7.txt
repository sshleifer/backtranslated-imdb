Back on the day of the large studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. Good old, all Americans James Stewart appears as Hungarian in the shop around the corner. Had I thrown the movie, Kralik had been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he made four movies with her. But only this is where none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a fighting player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda was then. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable was able to refrain from being an American in a roll of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were also American, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, then you see a nice movie from Ernest Lubitsch. The reason is quite simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest do not go together personally. But it seems that they are making a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart incorrectly with canoeing with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the leaders are fine, and Frank Morgan differs from his usual deputy himself, the two players who come out best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he leaves, after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is as big as the shabby little worm that constantly kisses up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I have known to many as Schildkraut in real life, who is on office policy 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off quite a bit of time.
