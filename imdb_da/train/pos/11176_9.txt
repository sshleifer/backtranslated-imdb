Okay, first I must point out that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old. If I had seen this two weeks ago for the first time, I would probably have noticed that this is just another cheaply made cable TV screaming movie with some well-designed scenes. But when you are nine, you just don't care about these facts. This scared hell out of me again, especially the aforementioned Zelda scenes (and they still do). Today I talked about this movie. I have to see this maybe once a month, and on every New Year's Eve I see this with a 12-pack beer and bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I quite agree with the people who said the action here is rather unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby look like I would have louis and rachel look like, but you can't see much affection or feelings on these two faces. Hughes and Gwynne largely save the scenes underpinning "Creeds". What I really want to say about this is the fact that there really isn't any other movie that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary, and I don't mean zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS MOVIE IS THE WISDOM A SIMPLE AND ONE OF A SKIL. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks superficially like a cable TV, but let yourself relax with only the best horror chillers out there? Okay, I hit some of the Cast's balls a moment ago, but I have to say that all pieces at this level also cut the overall to perfection. But please tell me if you really know some movies that look like Pet Sematary! I would really love to know ... And I don't mean the night for the living dead here ... this is far more than compared to intelligence compared to those things.
