Several posters have quoted Renoir, who expresses her desire to make a movie showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is that not all of us, while the hard reality is that only a few get it. At this stage of her career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell to director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within the year, after doing this to Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to start for Anastasia. This is one of three films that Renoir made in colors around this time and on balance it is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult and even with French Can Can. Renoir probably assumed that with so much that she could get away with a few leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The reason is actually based on a real event in French history, but Renoir is happy to give it a look over and concentrate on replicating his color's paintings in the post-setup setup. In its pastel colors, it resembles another movie in the period Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not bad. All in all, it is still a beautiful trifle that shows a beautiful and charismatic actress.
