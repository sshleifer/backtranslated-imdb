Homicide: The Movie turned out to be a good wrapper for a well-written, well-oriented and well-run series. Loose ends were tied up, which was not properly addressed at the end of last season. The whole series, and in particular the film, gave a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high rate of murder. My attraction in the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but when I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the film certainly retained that spirit. I will definitely miss new original episodes in the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and thrown to give us a last glimpse on the dark side of Charm City.
