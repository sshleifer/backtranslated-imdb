I disagree with anyone who may reject this movie as "just" entertainment. Seen right after the carefree, roaring 20s, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fool, Dance is in its heart a serious warning story with a clear message on how best to endure these tough times. Yet this fast and tight film is far from being a boring moral story. In the 30s, Hollywood had an opportunity to burn out an entertaining * and * enlightening audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a movie frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of * four * movies, which Harry Beaumont instructed in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, but its characters are well-developed, its history never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind. <br /> <br /> With the lonely exception of Lester Vail as the main love interest Bob Townsend, the support casting is uniformly strong. Worth noting is William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (best known as Jiminy Crickets voice) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early supportive role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's movie, and she shines completely in it. Did when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of Crawford would probably be unrecognizable to those who are more familiar with their later work. But here's the proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star of true meaning, a great actress with the charisma to carry a picture all alone. <br /> <br /> Result: Eight out of TEN
