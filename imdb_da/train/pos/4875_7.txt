"Father is still on business" was the headline for a "Promise Me This" premiere in Cannes. I understand why many find the same thing, but unique expressions of Kusturica are still present in their new movie and is why critics cannot touch him. I had two hours of clean energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, he is still unique and unspoiled. Surprisingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and smaller landscapes then in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has femme fatal world-class potential, don't let it ruin it. Surely, I recommend to everyone to watch this movie.
