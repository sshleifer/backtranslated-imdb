Twenty-five years ago, I showed this movie in some children's classes in Entomology and still remember the children's excitement; they were spellbound! It is not just about the termites that have built and live in the "castle holes", but also about the other animals that use the gardens. There is a fantastic scene where a cobra fights a screen lizard while a colony of mongooses watches. It is not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology, as there is so much about the interaction between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all the organisms living in and around the mouths. <br /> <br /> I wish it was available on DVD so I could see it again and show others.
