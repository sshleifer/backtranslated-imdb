The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - "Do you stamp the stamp briefly?" (which involved poor sexual energy from her fianc√©) was fun. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent too. Her innocent indignant expression has you wish she was yours. The hero handles the garage mechanic well for physical transformation. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle around the front of the press and the audience was done well. It is terribly underestimated and deserves acknowledgments and attempts at revival. It loses a voice to include the very unlikely far-fetched theory purchased by US Govt. I can't see why it doesn't exist in the 20 best romantic comedies of the century. Great Movie, it has the President's approval mark on it!
