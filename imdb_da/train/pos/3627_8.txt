What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found out that I enjoyed it more than my teenagers. Take a tissue, it's not sad, just 'move' in parts. Finally, it's a 'good' flick for the whole family. Note: It is 2+ hours, so consider leaving the smallest 'squirmers' home for this. AP
