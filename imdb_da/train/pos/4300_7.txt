This film may well have been one of the common "soaps" that relate to the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined. .. broken relationships, building new friendships, street bashings, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes! What a blend of events! Fortunately, the film producer goes beyond the daily events and asks questions to consider even if there is no satisfactory answer. He asks in this chaotic world that things just happen, it is just good luck when things go out right, or if you take a fatalistic view, a person is destined to be in a particular place at a certain time and thus get involved in the event and his future takes a new perspective? Most of us have had this eerie experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important? As a sign says ?? He once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite films but is a good study of human relations. Danny Glover is excellent in a sympathetic role.
