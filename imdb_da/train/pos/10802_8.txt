I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don't think this was supposed to be a straight successor to "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too" that makes me believe that although many of the sign names are the same, it is actually a completely different person . /> <br /> Think about it: Almost no connection to the previous movie, except for character names; a completely different story; various cast; and the fact that it is a partially musical. <br /> <br /> I say give this movie some credit. It has lots of laughs in it .. Mark Blankfield on his prime.
