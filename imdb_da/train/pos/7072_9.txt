Twelve Monkeys is a crazy, time-consuming, action movie film that stars Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that follows in November 1996. Unfortunately, he has also been sent back far until 1990, when everyone thinks he's crazy. <br /> <br /> This movie is exciting and has amazing plays by Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys are one of the biggest travel days I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
