Good action and interesting plot. Having seen the original I have to say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. Good throw .. meaningful acting .. Although it would be nice to see a little more expansion in the action scene instead of the background story. Fun movie to watch and keep you alert all the time 7/10 is a real voice I think!
