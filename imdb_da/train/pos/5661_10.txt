I see many people on this site who want AG to come out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, No less!) Although it's great to get this amazing show in a boxed DVD form, I'm worried about the fact that they added very few in the way of "extra's" (a pilot from Shaun Cassidy at Pilot episode) and the episodes appear in the same order they were posted on TV. The missing episodes that were never shown before they were run on the Sci Fi channel are in the box set, but are dressed in the final DVD. If you buy DVD sets, you get the right order they need to be seen and you will be happier. (You need to switch DVDs in and out of your player to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
