I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who any of the actors was, and I didn't know that the movie would be different from the one it was previewed. I loved it myself. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty stars as the 1930's detective detective Dick Tracy, who goes after the biggest bullies in town. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very strong man and is out to take over the city with his singer, Preative Mahoney (Madonna) who is watching Tracy. It gets even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: This criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond from the 1930s as he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> An ensemble movie of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus More! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie that a family can enjoy. Take my word for it.
