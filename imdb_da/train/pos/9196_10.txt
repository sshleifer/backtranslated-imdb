Kimi wa Petto is a sweet story of a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day. She decides to bring him in and fix his pieces. She makes a note for him to eat some food she made when going home because she had to go to work. When she comes home, however, she finds that he is still there. He tells her that he will live there with her as a brother or cousin. In desperation to get him to leave, she tells him that if he became his pet, he could stay. And as a pet, she says he wouldn't have any rights and do what she told him. (not in the perverted way!) To her surprise, he agrees, and from then on he is known as Momo, her pet.
