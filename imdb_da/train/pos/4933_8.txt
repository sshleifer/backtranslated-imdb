Refreshing `lost 'gem! With an effective dialogue combined with outstanding plays to establish the characters and engage you enough to take care of what is happening to them. The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins the fisticuffs battle scene, a car hunt in less than 60 seconds with a `logical 'end, and a long hunt on foot, ashamed of the exaggerated chase sequences of modern Hollywood. You know how it will probably end, but the excitement and interest is maintained all the time. The end of the hunt is one of the most realistic things you will ever see. The movie seems to slow a little past the middle, but remains with it for the rewarding conclusion.
