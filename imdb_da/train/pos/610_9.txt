Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy movie with predictable ending and average notions, it certainly is not. When I saw the movie, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of an adventure than an adventure movie. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the end of the movie. The story is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like any story, it has a little morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brethren will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who is able to overcome any obstacle and difficulties he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is low and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I need to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that perfectly fits her character. In addition, she and Cox have chemistry that makes the romance in the film even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses who, of course, make Stardust an interesting and "high classed" movie <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is FANTASTIC, the location magical and plotted interesting. was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for several awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
