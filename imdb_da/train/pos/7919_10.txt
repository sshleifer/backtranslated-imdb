Without a doubt calculated as a completely campy joke, "Full Moon High" depicts 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Probably Tony is bitten and grows fur and fangs when there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this movie is that he cannot age as long as he has the werewolves and that he must fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is simply fun when it starts. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-yahoo (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars coach / principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most eye-open cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont at "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the change of presidents; So gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Considering Alan Arkin - who plays a zanypsychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder if he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (except Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). Pretty fun. Also Elizabeth Hartman starring. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick "It's Alive".
