This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit the national television. It is unfortunate that the show is not placed among large sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did a fantastic job and seasons one to six were the show at its highest point. Even though season 7 was not so big compared to the previous six, it was still fun. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply went together. Not by themselves, the other actors were not good if any of 2 main characters had left as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also good) left show it would have the same influence. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) also didn't help because he wasn't well received by the show's fans. I think if the show ended a year ago, it would certainly go down in history as one of sitcom greats. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the finals were excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope I wake up one day to find out the show is back, as the 80s show with the same throw because I'm going to miss hell out of it.
