A surprising rental on a local video store was happy to find a media satire worthy of enough to challenge Oliver Stones Natural Born Killers. And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my view to be at the end of 2004 watching the Republican machine make it magical on the majority of America's television viewing folks. It raises the question "Are we really the manipulative?" <br /> <br /> This is certainly my viewpoint. There was also a major theological question that was provoked - the history of Christ. Could mouth to mouth and overwhelming dependence on something useful as television produces a messiah? Could the story of Christ be exaggerated? Could it have been completely manufactured? This is what the film puts in a highly perceptive light.
