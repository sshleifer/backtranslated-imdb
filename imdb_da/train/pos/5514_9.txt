I looked at part one two days ago, and today I saw part two. Of course, the two parts are worlds apart, so I'm a little shaken by everything I do. I felt devoured by the knowledge that Che's inevitable death was; for me it shaded the whole movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. Part 2 was so eerie compared to, again an inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive, and in Bolivia it was so negative. The policy for the movement in Bolivia was mentioned only, but was rarely confronted didactically. To me, the memorable scenes were all at the end of the movie: the confrontation with the prisoner and the milder talk with the Bolivian official, where the official asks Che about the lack of support for the fines for his revolution. I hadn't considered the national differences that played such a big role as they did in the conflict, Argentine against Bolivian. I thought Soderbergh was admired with the inevitable supply issues in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without assuming the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was hit by how hard it would be to try something that Che tried. I think that's all in the timing; is there enough anger against the government to begin the movement; in Bolivia there was not. Che realized the terrible corundum of the revolution in his letter to Fidel, read at the beginning of the movie: If not now, then, 50 years from now. A very thoughtful and well done film; do everything to see it.
