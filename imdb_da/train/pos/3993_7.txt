"The Mother" is a weird low-budget film that touches at least two unpleasant themes that are not normally explored in the cinema: moral love for their own son and daughter, and the third-age passion and passion. <br /> The characters are horrible: May is a disgusting old lady, and I think it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or grief for her. She admits that she did not love her son and her daughter. She deceived her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals her daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a guy without morality, it doesn't love her, but just because she feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way that destroys her daughter's delusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife who insists on having her shop, a horrible business. Darren is an amoral dependent jerk who doesn't like anyone even himself. <br /> <br /> The action and direction are excellent: the actors and actors have excellent performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
