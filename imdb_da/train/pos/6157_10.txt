This is a movie I had never thought of watching before my 3-year-old saw it in the video store and grabbed it after seeing a picture of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We got it and have seen it repeatedly since; In fact, we have rented it several times since. There are very few non-animated movies that my son will watch and be aware of; what a nice change from Dumbo and the little mermaid. The action is outstanding, the songs are convincing, they come deep into your head and you can't help singing together. The story, while specifically about WW2, is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you look. I have heard it in relation to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both good, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of the movies that kids will see over and over and one that parents don't mind adhering to. There are days we see it before wartime and bedtime, and I don't feel the moaning coming when he wants to repeat any other movie.
