I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I learned a lot much from Not without my daughter (1991)). Offside is a fantastic budget Iranian comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to participate in a decisive football game for their country's place in the World Cup. Women must not participate in football matches, so that the country's armed forces have been mobilized to save any woman who tries to get in on herself. Some (teen?) Girls try to break down the party by dressing as boys, but are trapped. The movie is mostly put on this sticker, where the girls are held back by soldiers and awaiting an indefinite penalty (although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims she was an insignia away from being executed!) <br /> < br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The thinking that connects women from football matches comes down to the fact that it is too violent an experience for the fair sex. A philosophy that is not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to mind when a girl is going to the toilet so a soldier escortes her claim that she covers her eyes so she can't see graffiti. The conflict is not solely about the sex struggle: at some point a friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban. Fortunately, this film was not too culturally esoteric that comedy had been lost on the great Satan's neighbor and cultural cousin. You have to be in the mood for it, but nobody should avoid this movie because they think they don't get it.
