Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was prevented from managing this film by the producer. The end product is a very uneven movie with a very horrible story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins "Greedy"). Joe Raposo's repetitive music also doesn't help. It was made on a wide screen so that VHS does not show it in all its glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still, it is worth looking at for some eye-popping animation.
