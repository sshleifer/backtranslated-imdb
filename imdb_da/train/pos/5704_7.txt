To be fair, I expected car tickets in this movie. There was only really one, but apart from that, "Freeway" was a great movie that I am happy to own on DVD. The only really big names in the cast are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as radiopsychiatrist and B-Movie villain par excellence Billy Drago as Revelation-citing Freeway Killer. But the rest of the throw generally gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she is completely rounded off as she seeks Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid, comes across as a tree, but then again, the character he plays, France, is not very good at a back story Sunny is given by his former commander. The dental threat is maintained throughout the film, and the atmosphere of the lonely LA highway at night with the killer who prowles its length in its eerie gray sedan, is an excellent way to build tension and the music used to emphasize the movie is appropriate composed. I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie then. Different kinds for different people, I suppose. But I absolutely enjoyed the 'Freeway' and I highly recommend it.
