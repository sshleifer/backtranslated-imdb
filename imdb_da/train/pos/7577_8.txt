Who's got the gold? unfortunately the last of HANZO THE RAZOR films starring Shintaro Katsu as the title character - the multi-weapon-capable, authority-bidding samurai officer with the "unique" technique of lamenting announcements out of unwilling female informants until they "spill the prayers" and pray about more ... This entrance starts with Hanzo "uncovers" a woman who poses as a ghost to protect a lake filled with bamboo trays filled with gold stolen from the treasury. This leads to Hanzo discovering a loan-hardening scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. The required sword and rape / interrogation is - ending in a decent ending to this weird film trilogy. <br /> <br /> Not quite as strong and enjoyable as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series ...) but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and Japanese pinky-style movies. 8.10
