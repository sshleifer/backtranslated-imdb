The Enterprise pilot has one thing missing since the original Star Trek: A dose of realistic, flawed personalities. Utopian characters in Next Generation became tiring, they were so noble to be incredible. I also like the subplot that people are bitter against the volcanoes. It's fun to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me look forward to seeing when humans become the dominant race between the two, although I don't think it would work in the time frame of the show. The only negatives that jumped out at me were "quickly interrupted the end of 2 hours", the end of the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The other was the shameless grave for reviews of a couple of meaningless sexy scenes. It was out of order, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to polish the pre-teen audience with some skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, as well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode does.
