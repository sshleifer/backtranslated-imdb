for the player playing video games here, someone noted that GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and some other things, including weapons from the movie associated with this movie, and this movie inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80s movies out there, i recommend it to anyone still not so it 10/10 no question asked
