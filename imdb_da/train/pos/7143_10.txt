"Holes" is my all-time favorite movie! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking to buy it on DVD this coming September. I read the book after watching the movie and was amazed at how much the book and the movie were. The director of this film did an excellent job of restoring the book to film form. Also, all the actors who were chosen to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props for all those involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it for anyone to see!
