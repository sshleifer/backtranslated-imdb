I can understand those who do not like this movie cause of lack of knowledge. First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but brothel tenants, and one who does not know the difference, do not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. This is a complete art work on women's lives and needs in this era. Everything is important, and certainly the way they dress, means the whole movie more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I suggest you read a little about this community before making a conclusion that is so out of reality. This is Kurosawa's work on life, and I am sure that the director understood Kurosawa's silent sense to the right intellectual area.
