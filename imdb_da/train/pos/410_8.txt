I rented this movie in DVD form without knowing anything about it, part of a winter marathon watching a movie every night. After several horrible American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors struck me as an excellent original movie. The story is completely nonsense, but I found the film's sincerity, kindness and complete lack of iron refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but the filmmakers are wisely more interested in color, composition and movement than realism, and so many of the images are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters on crooked peaks of stone, a large moon rising in front of them, the picture is perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess warrior traces through the heavens behind his glowing sword as a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotions rather than represent reality. People have the same simplicity and directness in cartoon characters, and they give no great depth in themselves, but refer to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically, several of the actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles straight up without irony or nap, and it's credible. <br /> <br /> Most odd of all, despite the clumsy of plot and thin characterizations, I found myself very close to tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, kind hearted vision of the director. <br /> <br />
