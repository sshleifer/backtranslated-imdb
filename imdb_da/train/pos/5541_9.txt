A very atmospheric cheapie that shows great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an eerie and moody texture. The story is farfetched, the play is only functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a whole visual narrative. This movie is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its history.
