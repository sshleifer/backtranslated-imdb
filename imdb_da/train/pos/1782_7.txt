I've seen this movie three times. Last time I continued to jump around in confusing scenes to find a solution for the plot. The goal may not be logical. Or maybe these rough spots are in the plot because Ann's recall of distant events is quite wrong. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has attended a named college with scions of a rich family. She must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but never seems to have any family ties at all. She never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her catastrophic decisions take effect. Ann shares an evening of passion with his great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). So, when Harris comforts Lila after the brotherly Buddy's tragic death, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and disgusted at his own behavior. I must have missed something essential here. Ann's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Ann surrenders her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed. It was evident from his behavior that Harris was deeply merged with Ann and would have forgotten him. A scene showing their chance meeting years after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationship. She always had an outcome with her men and she rejected them. This pattern was held with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love, and she remained with her husband until he died. Maybe Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came Lila Ross's distinguished resurrection on Ann's bed sheets. Apparently, Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last few clear moments to identify and contact Lila. None of this message appeared on the movie. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of the house Ann lived in in his last days. How could she afford to buy such a house on the poor earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed a step ahead of a financial disaster while hearing two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed the movie's setting and music immensely. Seaside Mansion was just as heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was brilliant as young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette much to the shiny look she had in the movie. If only those annoying CGI fireflies would go away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my voice!
