Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about lost from a colleague who had obvious opinions about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I saw an episode or 2 in the early seasons and I was sorry so I voted it out. After a couple of years, I stumbled over lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow, I was surprised. Can you say gravity well, enemy I was sucked in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward / back are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are certainly immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step over them, Juliet was much more classic than Kate. Mr. Eco way under-qualified and at Charlie level, if not more, too badly, they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a real curiosity. As a large, very layered series: looking for more. <br /> <br /> greetings
