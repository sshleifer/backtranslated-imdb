I first saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival this year and I was a teenager myself and I found the movie to be quite appealing. These children are, in addition to the usual and very unexpected, being in a movie of this stature, but with the right dialogue and junk they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I strongly recommend releasing and watching this movie. It is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. Capturing the essence of high school, the high school record has topped my favorite list and hopefully has a chance to be released to theaters. I really thank all the kids who have worked hard to make this movie, it helped me cry our eyes our laughter.
