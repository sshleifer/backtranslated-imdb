The full-rounded character of this movie's leading role, that of the coop that is torn up by its past and on a self-enrichment path that is so clear to the viewer, is unique to its time 1950. <br /> <br /> With the joking music and the well-written plot, the film is an excellent example of film noir at best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the fear inside, Karl Malden distinguishes himself as his boss, who has no nonsense, but also has compassion for them during his command in the area. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this type of film just about his own. If there are any mistakes, it would be with the splendid Gene Tierney beauty that seems oddly out of place with the hardened policeman. However, their scenes in the cafe are wonderful and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the small part of her father, is perfect as Gary Merrill is like a hood. Great lighting and mood setting. The building, where the deadly deeds take place very atmospherically, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
