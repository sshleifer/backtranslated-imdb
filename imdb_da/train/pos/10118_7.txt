I really like the Miikes movie about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it was really my head. Never before have you seen such a sick and twisted thing. The story is good and the actors do their things very well. I haven't seen the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that I think the German DVD is a little censored. If you haven't seen the movie already and live in Germany, you might look better at a DVD from Holland or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains many very hard and unpleasant scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes. All in all, a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like Miike for !!
