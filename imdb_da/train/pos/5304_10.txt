Pecker is a hilarious fun, but angry movie about a small town in Baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer taking pictures of "real things". No beautiful models, no beautiful men, just hard living. This wonderful movie hides fun on plastic in the urban art chain. There is a special scene when a homeless woman shopping at Pecker's mother's shop buys the same exact coat as one of Whitney Art Junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This only shows you that no matter what kind of money you have, you may not always taste. Once again, John Waters sends you to an infinite spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can get your regular Hollywood movies with special celebrities and mountains of celebrities, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) over a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" anyday !!
