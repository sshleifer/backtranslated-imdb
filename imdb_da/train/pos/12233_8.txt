Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions take on a space mission that sees them flying through Saturn's rings. His comrades are killed immediately, but they seem to be the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a steady mass of humanoid pulp; As he turns into a sour killer who melts every step of the way, he is traced by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> This is often so much fun - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - it's hard for me to think the laughs are unintentional. It seems to me to be a kind of goof on low-budget re-efforts from the 50s and 60s, and as such it is a wonderfully entertaining movie. The sequence with the nurse is simply fun. We are even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything, but it's still a gas to watch. <br /> <br /> Author / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this brilliant idea; His ultra-slim character is actually a memorable one. I think his pacing is a bit gone; Some scenes (like the one with the older couple) go a long time, but ultimately he delivers solid, bell, B-movie goods with a degree of panache. The Climax is especially fun. Arlon Obers' music is fun (even funny stupid for a few moments), and Willy Curti's film cabinet creates some really good shots at times. It brings me to Rick Baker's amazing and compelling makeup effects, forming a very respectable film centerpiece right down to the ultimate final melt. Rebar is under the great makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and doing what he should do well enough. DeBenning makes for a rather shameless and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is also not as warm as her wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are good at supporting. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (making a noticeably topless shot), Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers' 'Eating Living' and Wes Craven's' The Hills Have Eyes') and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie with enough fun, chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for low-grade sci-fi / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
