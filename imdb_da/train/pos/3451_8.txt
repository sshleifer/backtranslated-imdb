First of all, this movie was not released for theaters (TESTED BANGLY THEY SAY), I say, they figured the story of crooked police, politicians and dedicated newspaper people had been put to death, just send it DVD & cable TV> and take that money race. <br /> <br /> That said, I usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard & Distaff, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The reason and story has been put to death, but the above cast brings the life of this violent movie and it is actually visible. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, the others are either crooked policemen and politicians or some decent guys. The 2 ladies are girl friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & do what is required. It's pretty violent, many killings, etc. Not for children. In no way is it a great movie, BUT for what it is and it threw. It is certainly good. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
