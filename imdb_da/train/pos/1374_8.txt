A French movie Ester Williams would love. But the synchronized swimming was just a nook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia who found himself. No question where Sciama's sympathy lies, as all the boys are depicted as "animaux", but in fact, only the 3 girls are in focus, and for all the time, with the few adults and the other young people who are mostly in the background. Marie is a girl with a girl, incoherent, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and strengthens herself at Floriane (a renascence-quality beauty per one reviewer), and she is also a friendly convenience to Anna: not uninteresting, but for her, the time of her body's perfection was short and now has she is a young in a woman's body. What follows is a journey of self-realization without a driving license, but there is a glumness about the three that are natural: where are youth happiness and thoughtless talking? While it was a wonderful setting, with Florianes self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful association of Marie and Anne, it all seemed to be abstract, Sciama's dolls.
