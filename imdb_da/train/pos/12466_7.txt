If Jean Renoir's first film "Whirlpool of Fate" first takes us into the country's world, the rivers, the peasants he will continue to explore, seem to only fit his other movie mostly with wealthy and privileged the upper classes and those trying to climb upwards. Put the characters from the first two movies together and you have the seeds of his great "Grand Illusion" and "Game Rules". This is beautifully recorded, with the restless camera utilizing the fantastic, large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the movie's interior, and the play, though often over-stretched, also gives some good moments, especially from Werner Krauss's Muffat. But the glamorous and hungry wife Hessling, who initially looks like she might give Louise Brooks a run on her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a single note, selfish destiny. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the script, which apparently mainly goes for high points and outrageous feelings; I have not read the novel, I am not fully aware of whether the elections were well-founded or not. <br /> <br /> But the differences between Nana's suitors are well drawn, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelos Vandeuvres - the tragic understandings that each seem to have of his final fate and their sympathy with each other Especially in the scene at the bottom of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if the violence will break out - this and other discoveries of the ridiculous ride ridicule help to give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and for me just shy of whirlpool of Fate, this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or interested in silent cinema in general.
