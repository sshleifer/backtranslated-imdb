A linear journey within a non-linear structure. It is a fact that time in 12 monkeys flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. However, the linearity of the film cannot be avoided: it is the projector's great work, the interpretation of the interpretation. <br /> <br /> What we can see underlying theme is a reflection on inevitable actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam movie is a world with little space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, we are informed of a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague will rule the earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus. Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: go back to the mid 90s to investigate anything and who is related to the release of virus. There is no way to change the past: All that can be done is to gather information that can help today's scientists (that for us viewers is the future) to find cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but to make the present better. <br /> <br /> In his "return" in time, Cole gradually comes close to a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (this word is indirectly ironic) to begin the journey to the past. Researchers have not yet reached the highest level of performance in time travel, and Cole ends up with wrong dates - this will later appear in the plot as proof of his hygiene for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> Throughout history, we can see that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than a moment when the stage is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appear. It changes itself, as Cole's memories reveal in his dreams. <br /> <br /> In an airport, a man is shot while running, armed against another. A blonde woman runs after the murdered. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (where Cole is a child visiting the airport with his parents), the present (the time of history) and the future (adult cole) throughout the story has the cole feeling Having lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents who shoot him stop him from killing the crazy researcher, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> What can't be changed. And in Cole's case, what was, is what will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A movie not really well understood by many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. Other great films with a similar theme: Back to the future trilogy (which has a different angle to the "food scientist" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of degradation - especially in the second movie - it is far more optimistic than Gilliam's work , it's a weird Hollywood picture). In another register there is "Wild Strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, It entails a striking and enlightening journey to the past through dreams and reminders. I've never seen "La Jet√©e" but only because I can't find it.
