A great black and white night camera photography and lots of it highlights this supposed true life account of a murder in the 1950s in Kansas, where a whole family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote so you get the very liberal anti-death sentence announcement at the end of the movie, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheists who have been angry at life and who unnecessarily murder this lovely family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying slope at the end, this is an easier story from the start and the cinematography makes it even more fascinating. Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this. It makes me want more modern films to be made in black and white. Watch it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here. My third view of this movie came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake was actually pronounced innocent in his wife. You can't help but look at Blake and this movie differently after that.
