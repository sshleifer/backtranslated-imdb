Two war workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret lovers as they respond under box number aliases. Within this simple idea and an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich blanket of humor, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with true feelings and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own under-plots and jokes. Although it is improperly enlarged by Stewart's 39/40 movie (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Smith), this is easily on par, and we enjoy a wide variety of acting subtlities invisible in the other films.
