Why do people bitch about this movie and not about horrible movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the biggest movie of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by everyone because someday some said they didn't like it anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie is not only the most Oscar-awarded movie all the time, most of the money ever made and unfortunately one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. Apart from that, it's really the best movie all the time. The only movies that come close to being like any Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogy or any of the champions Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all great movies and directors, but no one matches up to James Cameron's masterpiece TITANIC.
