Japan 1918. The story of the 16-year-old Ryu begins with his father's death. As will be revealed later, both her parents have died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Ryu's aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawaii, whom they only know from his image. At her arrival in Hawaii, ryu is discovered that her new husband is much older than in the photograph and that he lives in very humble conditions beside a sugar cane plantation where he works. Ryu is not used to the hard work on the plantation and in despair over her situation in her new home seems to run away. She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go. The friendship of Kana, a female colleague of her, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between the 1907 and the 1920s, as thousands of Asian women were married to men in America who they only knew from their image. This not very well-known picture is well-written and acted. The location is breathtaking. This movie also features Mifune Toshiro in its very first screen as a Benshi (tells of silent movies). This film gives an insight into Japanese culture here and over the sea. A must see!
