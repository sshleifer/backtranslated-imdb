Okay, here's what I think of Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for VHS tape and I was thinking of myself, it looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy was it right, it's interesting. They set the serial killer's spirits in dreams, start-up and everyday life machines. But it must be the most unique place to set the spirit of a serial killer. Inside a snowman's body. I liked all the friendly snowy landscapes that burst the landscape, the pot holder, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he was joking in a murderer who's not really seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said so. FREDDY KRUGGER. That's the level of "cool". I wish some of the marionette effects were better, the mouth movements could have matched better. But I criticize it for a small budget. The cast does a good job, there are some good one liners and scares to do some hardcore horror fan jump. All in all, a great story, good effects, great dialogue and a great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
