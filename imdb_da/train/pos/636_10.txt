Why are the previews so clear for a movie that is so amazing !! Everyone should know what an excellent movie is. It is engaging and fun from the first moment, original and well-behaved. I want the movie to make itself as good as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative Beginner Charlie Cox is an amazing leader. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making a good move with her recent return to the screen. There are also many fantastic moments from smaller figures ... even down to facial expressions.
