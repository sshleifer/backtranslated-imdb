Hmmmm, do you want a little romance with your mystery? This has it. I think if the romance was deleted, it would have made for a better movie. But how could the romance be ditched when the story is borrowed from something called a Harlequin Romance novel, no matter what. If romance had been killed, history could have been a little too weak. The mystery here was not that bad, quite interesting, but nothing at the level of Mission Impossible international espionage. Oh good. I thought Mel Harris was quite good; Her short skirts I think have added some sex complaints ... but this Rob Stewart man might have been better thrown, perhaps with a more famous TV movie actor. The management was decent and the writing could have been improved - both could have been a little edgier, a little darker, more adventurous. One thing that was great about this was the use of real European locations. It could easily have changed so that it could have been filmed in Canada, but they were really in beautiful beautiful places like Budapest. Possibly a disadvantage was the director and / or the film photographer's choice to hit certain shot picture postcards perfectly. Not good. Had this been a more dramatic movie shot shot to the big screen, the perfect scenes of the graphics card should really take a back seat and just be a good part of the background. This was just a television movie, although they had to add some ummmph to the picture, and some of the ummmph came from the scene. Overall, it's not really a bad movie. I will tell you what this was absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I have ever seen! (and the only thing I know of.) I hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre television movie that gives it a character on C-
