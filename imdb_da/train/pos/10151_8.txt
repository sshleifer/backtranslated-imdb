A beautiful postcard in New York. What I enjoyed most was being able to see this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to show up. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son to Natasha Henstridge and my daughter to Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we couldn't remember the last time we could sit with the kids and EVERYTHING enjoy something. This movie told a story that felt comfortable but not old or finished. The end came with a twist that we all liked. If you are not a cynical person and you are willing to let a story unfold, then it is for you. As a guy, it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies, and one did. I recommend it and we need more of these movies to watch.
