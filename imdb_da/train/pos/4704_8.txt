This movie is just a lot of fun. I've seen it a few times, but it always has something fun that I remember. The car scene "Duckies and Bunnies" is one of my favorites and I still quote Morone's versions of certain words! <br /> <br /> There are so many ongoing jokes that it's great. But I still love Michael Keaton!
