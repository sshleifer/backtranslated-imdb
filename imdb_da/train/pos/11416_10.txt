An excellent family movie ... gives a lot to think about ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is amazing - it's so ... right ... such things could happen in everyone's life. And don't forget to shop - it's just amazing! Just look at Frankie and you know what I was thinking ... This picture is a real one, can't be missed !!!
