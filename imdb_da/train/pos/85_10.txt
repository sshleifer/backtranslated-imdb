I saw this movie while in Birmingham Southern College in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon. Both films are the same in their dream-like quality. The majority of the film involves a fish swimming happily in its bowl, while his new owner, a little boy, is away in school. A cat enters the room, where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to curl with his "prey". The boy starts his journey home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will come in time to save his fishing friends. The fish is excited by the cat's presence and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly goes over to the fish, gently takes him up with his paws and turns him back to his bowl. The boy returns to his fish, no one wiser. The ending is fantastic in both its irony and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have pulled the technical feat back in 1959 - it seems more like a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, watch it - you won't be disappointed! And if you * do * find it, let me know so I can also get a copy!
