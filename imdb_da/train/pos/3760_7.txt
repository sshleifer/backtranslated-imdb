It may not have been up to academic awards and it's pretty beautiful, but it's just so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic and fun, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love excellent adventures, Bogus Journey is more fun for me. Death is flippin fun and Bill and Ted are even more endearing. People make me sad to love this movie, but only very pretentious movie actors say it isn't even entertaining. If you like this, you'll probably also be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though silly, they make you laugh and turn your source box over. Then just watch them for kicks and giggles !!
