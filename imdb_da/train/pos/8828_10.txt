I was so glad I came across this short movie. I am always so disappointed that short films are hard to cross, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so happy that I actually had a movie as I was rooting for. <br /> <br /> The reason is pretty simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come up with a reason why people would suddenly break into a song and dance number as they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really captivating. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made short film, well edited and the actors all do a good job. And the last shot of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
