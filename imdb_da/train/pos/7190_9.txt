Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a series serial just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation expects the gold produced by this one city to keep the republic solvent. But a gold god, Don del Oro, stirs up the Indians and steals the gold for himself. Its Zorro and his band of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro, and he cuts a bursting figure as he enters a nice selection of bits (most were reused by the later Zorro series and other series). The story is moving and it's nicely clear who the real bad guy is. There's a reason why I've seen this most of any serial I've seen, it's simply a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare to is Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other swashbucklers in the period. It's super and highly recommended.
