Of the three remakes on W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this is the best and not particularly because of what John Cromwell brought to the movie. The movie is worth a look because of Bette Davis' breakthrough, which, like Mildred Rogers, showed the movie industry, she was a star. Finally, her fight with Jack Warner and his studio is paid generously. <br /> <br /> The movie is dominated by Mildred from the start. We realize from the start that Mildred doesn't care about Philip and never wants to. She does not hide her contempt for this kind of soul who is in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated by Mildred again, and again, as she does not make bones about what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey besides being disabled is a weak man. When he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. It is when Mildred returns to him when she is weak and defeated that he rises to the occasion, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his crew. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a wonderful portrayal of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. Her disgust at the friendly Philip is evident from the start of their relationship. When she tells him she was washing her mouth after kissing her, one of the most powerful moments in the movie is. Leslie Howard underplayed Philip and made him become even weaker than he is. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are seen in minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is Bette Davis show and don't forget it!
