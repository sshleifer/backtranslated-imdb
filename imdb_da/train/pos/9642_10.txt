The film is very realistic. Absolutely it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre, where each line must be taken in a perfect way and where each movement is accurate. The actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures. Overall, the movie climbs the viewer into a depressed state. Here the realism of the whole story is evident. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. However, I can say that the film does not end with a bad note. We see, we learn we experience ourselves. It is probably moral for this story.
