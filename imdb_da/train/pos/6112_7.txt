It is primarily a chick flick, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some beautiful cute fighting scenes, I don't think any wires were used, or if they were, they weren't flat out blatantly. It's not a terribly complicated movie, so it's easy in the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, quite simple, good chemistry between the leaders and a fun watch. I want it, if they did the full potential of the girls, just look once because she can be incredibly sweet, but in the whole movie they keep it low exactly right. I wanted to see it again ... with a girl.
