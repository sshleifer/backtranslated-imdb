I must say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I bored and looked through t and found the "Home Room" and it was already about 5 min, but I was hooked. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in everyone's life. I give it a 10, more if possible. The director / writer and the actors did a fantastic job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and will learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this. I loved it! I didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I wish it could go into the movies for more people to see.
