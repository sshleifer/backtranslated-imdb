Malefique has pretty much the viewer from start to finish with his boring atmosphere. Almost the whole movie is set in a prison cell that revolves around 4 characters, where transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are by far the strangest. Soon, the inmates find a diary of a former inmate behind a brick dealing with his occupation of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell. From here, everything is about uncovering the secret of the book and its magic of escaping from prison. It leads to some accidents coming out of the cell in the unknown light. Actually, I think the story is pretty bad and the final twist is nice, but for me the ends are pretty loosely tied together. Still, I was thrilled at the last minute because the movie's atmosphere is unique with minimal setting and casting. The killings are raw and creepy ... it does not go to relax your back and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of hell themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish hue. At times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is foreign. When the delayed boy loses his fingers and licks to sleep on Marcus's breasts, does it work normally, so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be? With its budget, the film creates a unique mood and the cooler viewer in a completely different way than most genre shockers do. I just wished the story had led to a more consistent final. Several elements such as the visitor with the camera, the other obsession inserted with books and the toy doll that vaguely point to the end do not fit closely into the story. Still, I would watch other films by director Valette, although it is a turn to see that he is making a Hollywood remake of "One Missed Call" that was worn and unusable already in the Miike version.
