Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest films so far in the 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's astonished and personal forgetful roles in previous comedies. With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just zap and crackle by his old self, Carrey vigorously carries this movie to the heights of the laughter and also some dramatic, dull, gloomy moments. Elements of Jim's real acting abilities continue to appear in this movie. This lovely summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the clever moments that fit this script perfectly. Bruce, Almightly still deserves to be a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy / drama. Eight out of ten stars.
