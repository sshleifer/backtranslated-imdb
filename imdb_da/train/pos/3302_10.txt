Perhaps it is most polished and done by all Indian movies - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps associated with Bollywood movies (ie, stickiness, farce, wholesale and failed imitation of Western movie themes / genres). Pakeezah is native to the subcontinent and authentic, almost Mrs Butterfly-like in plot. Characters are well-developed, direction, though sometimes untouched by today's standards, convincing and convincing. The urdu-speaking milieux at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subterranean age! The action (especially the 'appearance' and the dynamics of characters) is a pleasure to see, even though the nuances can be lost on contemporary viewers or those who are not familiar with the Muslims' morals and customs. <br /> <br /> Linked, with a captivating manuscript, is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist, displaying a prominent command of classical Indian dance (kathak). As is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take her to the audience without the viewer feeling that he / she has been a celebration of a truly memorable cinematic experience. Pakeezah is surely the top of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.
