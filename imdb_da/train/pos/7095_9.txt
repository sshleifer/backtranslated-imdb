Terry Gilliam's amazing feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises but still touches your heart thanks to the amazing cast. Gilliam's phantasmagorical flair works with the script of David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis in his most Steve McQueen-like - better than McQueen himself!), A Time-Traveling Judge from the future, which literally does not know if he is coming or going as a team of scientists, keeps sending him back to the wrong period while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that is fatal to humans but harmless to animals. Willis, the just Oscar nominee Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist provide some of the best achievements in their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is on the hunt. This is a non-miss!
