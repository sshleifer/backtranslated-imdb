Fascinating I approached I am curious (yellow) and it is companion with great enthusiasm. I would read several reports of its widely spied controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not this, but a thoroughly thought-provoking and engaging cinema experience, unlike any other. I sincerely believe that the majority of the commentary that felt the movie was "lame" or "boring" approaching the movie as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography whose pornography is something that must titrate the senses, but it is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws her all together in her performance and gives it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. Her breasts can be saggy, her nipples are unusually large, her thighs fat and her face, plump. But at the end of the film, the audience will identify with her and accept her mistakes as a human being. This touch gives her even more credibility out of necessity. If the director had hit a Briget Bardot boom, the effect would have been lifted. I can no longer recommend this thoughtful piece. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought into this deliberately fast-paced movie. The patient and modest viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways that most other movies could dream of.
