Allow yourself to be transported to another, old school kind of storytelling. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. Allen's latest mouse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in last year's Match Point, also by Allen), is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten cake and turn it into a plain-looking student type using nerdish glasses and outfits but still failing to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman's lordly character can be so beaten off by her, given the king's background (not calm, no spoilers here). There are no major transformations to Johansson's character here, as she consistently plays the same character despite the fact that the script says otherwise. You even forgive his character's apparent lack of logic, pursue an affair with a suspected serial killer, simply because he's his Royal Hotness Jackman, who is refreshing to see the anger of Wolverine Duds. <br /> <br /> If something is consistent, what 70-year-old Allen is all about. He continues to tell his stories of celluloid in the same way he always has; as if he has never been exposed to modern filmmaking, which is likely to make his calm, simple films appealing. They never seem to target a particular market; as if Allen makes movies to his liking alone, whether the public likes it or not.
