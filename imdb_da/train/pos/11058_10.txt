I have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it had depth, and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, there was still longing and expectation. The idea that they might not come together ... it is an indie film. this film was well written, directed and acted. the dance on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
