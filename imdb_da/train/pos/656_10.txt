Of all the reviews I have read, most have been very hard on Alexandre. Neither Marie nor Veronika ever thought they would desperately want to keep Alexandre, he is a little intelligent, but not at all intellectual, as most of us are, yet hard can it be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being completely taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls allow this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. Is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? I do not think. Although the French New Wave cinema is prone to bias and so on, it is wonderful simply because it lacks a need for a plot to create emotions. Someone is perfectly lovely, and everyone else in Alexandre's position in an urban area can ask for it. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
