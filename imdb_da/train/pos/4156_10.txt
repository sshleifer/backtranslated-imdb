I've seen a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since it was premiered (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the best cases of writing and acting I've seen from Bruckheimer's house. The younger officers were spot on, and the manuscript and editing, soundtrack and play made this episode a tour d'force. If I were the producers, I would send this episode to Emmy consideration, the amazing thing about how complete a portrait was made Coop and Jimmy within the 48-minute episode that requires many talented people to do their best, I hope there is a warning about when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I will see a lot, I didn't notice the first time around.
