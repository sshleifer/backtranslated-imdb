With an old collection of stories posing a challenge to the production team, how can this classic character be updated and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while touching memories from her former audience. In my opinion, their mission was fulfilled. One should look for toddlers, pre-teens, teens and their parents. OK, there are a few scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with small children have to sit tight, the movie goes on to better things. I'm going to go with the bad user auditors who point out that Emma Roberts gives us a positive role model for young women, not even syrup over it. Nancy balances her femininity with career-oriented slot skills. A lot to suffer in here, laughs, doesn't take too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus and similar characters. Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion.
