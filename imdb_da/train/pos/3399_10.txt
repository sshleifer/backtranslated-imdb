This was Eddie Robinson's 101 movie and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after the recording was finished. All that makes his key scene in the movie the more attractive. <br /> <br /> Although some hair and clothing styles are a bit dated (also note video games shown in the movie), the subject of the movie is pretty timeless. Heston said he had wanted to make the movie for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> More things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The play is top-notch, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with fine performances also by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The medium of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements allows for some really moving scenes. This was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of the movie is a significant one. Yes, it is a movie about overpopulation, but on a more important note, it is a warning of what can go wrong with Human Land Management. It is in the subtitle that you find the movie's real message. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and note how Thorn is unable to understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my top sci-fi movies all the time.
