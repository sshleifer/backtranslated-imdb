I wouldn't call "We're back! A Dinosaur story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Just like the former, it asks for security to bring creatures from an era into ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who gave the votes: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To rewrite it: A particular actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, The Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the chief "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the three amigos and CNN guy. <br /> <br /> But I suppose I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought this movie had something for both children (pure fun) and adults (natural history). True, it is escapism, but the perceptive kind. In fact, I would say that John Goodman does Rex's vote here is a kind of precursor to his voice work in "Monsters Inc". Worth to see.
