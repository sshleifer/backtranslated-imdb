I work with children from 0? 6 years old and they love all Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. When they start singing, '' We are the Doodlebops We are Doodlebops We are Doodlebops Oh yes Come and join in the fun because we laugh and we sing all day 'it is almost impossible not to join them in song. Doodlebops brings the viewer to the world of color and fun. Every show is an adventure, Doodlebops does not attempt to change the world of preaching messages what they do is fun while sorting out everyday challenges that the young child can relate to Doodlebops is a refreshing, high-action alternative to regular children's television programs.
