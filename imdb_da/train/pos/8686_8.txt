The second official episode of the "Columbo" series ("Murder by the Book" filmed later, hit the airwaves first). Robert Culp, who wanted to match Peter Falk's detective in several future installments, is terrific as the short-haired head of a sophisticated private detective agency killing a client's wife when she refuses to infuse her harassment. The two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise, which is one of the best in the series.
