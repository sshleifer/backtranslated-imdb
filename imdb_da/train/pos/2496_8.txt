No nonsense - no where even near waste. Not an original one? That is the last thing that could be said of "2.4 children". Predictably? certainly not! Although it was an unusual series for the BBC, it was fun, fun and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - which I think they were preformed wonderfully. Gary Olsen was also very good and it was also all the other cast members. I'm never completely new why it was cell-fed to read here today about Gary Olsen's death at a relatively young age. I wish they would do more of this type of comedy, much more of them (and show them here in Israel). One way up!
