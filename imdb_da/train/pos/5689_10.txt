First, it is a review of the two floppy disks that came with the "Wonderland" DVD rental. <br /> <br /> The two films included in the rental, the "Wonderland" and the Johnny Wadd documentary, completely wipe out the myth created by "Boogie Nights". That the myth was that the characters involved in the adult film trade were significantly more than the slimy lowlifes who would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything but abominable self-centered whores. This is incredibly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did to "The Godfather" fable and most of the rest of the gangster romance. Now what irritated me most is watching these movies, and probably going to tell anyone who looked and looked like "Boogie Nights" is how stupid and credible people seem to be educated and sophisticated. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who, unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no redeeming quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who mistreated someone close to him, was completely consumed by his quest for self-sufficiency and was undoubtedly an important participant in the brutal murders of Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The movie is just the big lie that "Boogie Nights "was and reinforces Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business known as the adult movie entertainment industry. This should be required viewing, both features on the "Wonderland" DVD, for anyone who had positive opinions about the story of the movie "Boogie Nights".
