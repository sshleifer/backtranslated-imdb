50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy can see its age, but it bears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still fun. Crosby was never really romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the slightly humorous edge it needs. Bendix plays wide and is great fun in a part that requires his strengths. Hardwicke - how happy a knight of wealth - a real one - to throw in capsules like this with such a task. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys herself in the least splendid of the most important roles. Only Murvyn Vye draws as a convincing Merlin. Although not musical, the songs are very good and the "dance" routine that comes with Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - fun, appropriate, clever without being challenging, and making a virtue out of Croby's musical movement that we let Being fair was inherently entertaining because it was never his greatest strength. The color is fine, the sound is a bit muddy in places. </ br /> <br /> And the story - yes it takes some freedoms with the original, but I suppose Mr Clemens might well have been happy with the result.
