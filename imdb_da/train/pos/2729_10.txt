I voted well for how good the action was, not for the content. It still gives me chills after reading the book and then watching the movie. Two ex-cons travel to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the disadvantages taught in prison. During the tour, the tension begins to mount as the soundtrack in the film adds general expectation. After the killings have finished their work on the farm, one finds the surviving family's remains of the morning of the daughter's church friends. The blood curry screams as the stage pans on the phone with the chopped cord, really got me the blood cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their only fate is a little comfort to this condemned family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also very well written by Truman Capote.
