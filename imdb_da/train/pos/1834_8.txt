This is movie is very touching. I don't care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. The performances of Amitabh Bachchan's role have the dying father, who is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life if something happens to him, and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. Shefali Shetty's supporting role, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her little role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as the brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as a show father has a very good connection, and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
