Although I like EE "Doc" Smith's books and David A. Kyle's books by Lensman, the anime that is loosely based on the books is quite fun and something innovative fair. Although the story may seem familiar to Sci-Fi / Fantasy buffs, as a child on an isolated planet inherits mysterious forces and deviates his family's death, it is, however, an entertaining one. Plus, Lensman was the first animated movie to use the hand drawing and CG animation at once. Sure, it might look a little outdated now, but it's still an innovation. If it wasn't for Lensman, nothing would ever have happened (personally I think Computer Graphics looks better in animation that lives action.) <br /> <br /> Too bad they only gave it out to DVD / VCD in a few countries in worls (mostly on formats that are rather foreign and different). I just want them to release the Lensman film and television series on DVD / VCD in all parts of the world, not just specific parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel rules! I just think he's so wonderful and nice as well.
