Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear family living in the Chicago projects. Whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs or rural areas, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe that a family is just a family rather than a show of a poor black family. But they do not dwell on it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air, unless I didn't like them killing the father, as I agreed with Esther Rolle, who fought hard to keep the family together. But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We saw Janet Jackson's Penny grow up a bit. This show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being preachy, Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
