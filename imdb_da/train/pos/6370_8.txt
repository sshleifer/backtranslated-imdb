To my surprise, I really enjoy Disney's latest animation deduction. The film had its recessions, but in general I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an animated Disney movie that was not musical. I was pushing the boundaries with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music a break. Another nice feature about the movie is that the comedy was not completely stupid (a la Hercules), rather subtle, so it still made the kids laugh while they didn't make adults feel dull or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated movies going on outside Disney studios, you'd think they'd move along and catch up with a little. There is something to be said about tradition, but imagine the possibilities of Atlantis history! Overall, the movie was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
