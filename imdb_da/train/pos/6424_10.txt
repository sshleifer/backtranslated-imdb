As a child, I remember nine or ten and love this movie. It was the whole round of Bollywood action / comedy movie. It's an imitation of Bad boys of course! Whole swap identities, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colorful villains dancing and singing! The action scenes in the movie are not revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The movie is really much fun and the big comeback Amitabh Bachan was needed. Govinda is a gem as always, and this is probably his best work to date, he shines as a side scoop and delivers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. The songs .... The songs are both fun and imprisoned ............. the evidence laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan surprisingly is very funny and makes you laugh like " Bathing Miah '.... his accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ...' Assi chutki naab re daal 'is the best song ............ Hilarious.
