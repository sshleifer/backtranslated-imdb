When we speak Hollywood Hotel, we could talk about one of three things, the real hotel, the radio program and this movie, which was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell hosted the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio network, where Louella Parsons played the weekly scoop on the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934, so in 1937 it had its fair share of the radio public. Powell hosted, sang and kibitzed with Louella and her movie star guests. With the power she had with her column, she could get the various stars to continue and connect their latest movie to nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the US Radio Technology Association entered and demanded that she pay wages accordingly and they won the case. It ended the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Louella went on to other radio episodes. The whole story is covered by Tony Thomas's book The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug was pulled, this movie came out from Powell's home study of Warner Brothers inspired by the radio program. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the Benny Goodman band, signed for a Hollywood contract. But when he comes out to Hollywood, he gets along with a selfish movie star Lola Lane, her lookalike double real sister Rosemary Lane and a ham actor in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in a civil war epic he does with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Then Mowbray is developing a problem with Lina Lamont when asked to go to the Hollywood Hotel radio program broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel. It has the study in a tizzy. Let's say the problem is not solved as it is to sing in the rain, but Powell's manager Ted Healy turns out to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer give a really good score for the movie. The big hit song comes right at the start when Benny Goodman's band with scat song Johnnie Davis sings Hollywood's hymn, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite though is Powell and Rosemary Lane song, I'm like a fish out of water. Just listen to Johnny Mercer's lyrics about Ginger Rogers, running Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan. It is a compendium of American folk culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley does choreography here and there the movie doesn't do Don't have the twilight imaginary things his previous work with Warner Brothers has, the numbers are well staged. Berkeley's big moment is in a shopping area where Powell and Healy have been forced to work. The number begins with Benny Goodman's broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel makes Let It be a lesson to you and then on the driveway Powell, Lane and the whole place begins to join the song for exasperation by owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what to expect from Edgar Kennedy's expedition. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why he was called King of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophoneist Lionel Hampton as part of his ensemble. It also sinks with Frances Langford. And possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a guy who had a little bit like radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not until he became 40th president in the United States. Ronald Reagan always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as being the two guys at Warner Brothers, who were most helpful to an avid young player who wanted to get his character. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is a nice and entertaining movie, dated but fun so.
