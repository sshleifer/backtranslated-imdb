This film is a fantastic piece that convinces even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the finest film actors in the last 50 years. His performance chokes, entertains, deters and charms you while you leave the weather. This film was shot in the early days of his film career and is very raw but is still able to convey Depardieu's mastery. A must-see for any Depardieu fan and by far his best early work.
