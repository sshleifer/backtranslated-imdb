Hey people, what's going on? It's me man, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura Killer" Kelly. You know ........ You can't really write a review on Sakura's script because we didn't have one. As far as I know, the story was just finished when we went together. I had the best time in my life to make that movie and became so stinky that I ran out of Jism ........... fun times. So glad you all enjoy the movie. I really didn't get to do the games I had imagined. Every time I put some moves up, the battle director continued to change them. Yet I had a blast and met some really good people. Especially the purple female ninja that seems to fall into the filmmaking scene.
