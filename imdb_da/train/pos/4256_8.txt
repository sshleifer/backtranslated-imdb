Such a nice movie! Very heart warming. You can't help falling in love with Gigi's character. He is cute as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie is about him. He lives in a wonderful world ?? live whole life ?? curiosity, desire and expectation. There is an older brother trying to steal his glory, but really remains in the shadow all his life. The father is very stereotypical Italian and it is also the mother. I wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene ?? and make them cry and laugh. I also wish that at least there was something redeeming about the older brother. His personality seems to have been the waste completely. Passion and ardor ?? That is the key to life. And looking through the camera ?? focuses on small details and enjoys delicate details of life.
