The lovely Danish actor Sonja Richter steals this movie from underneath all the nose, not a small feat considering the amazing achievements that surround her. Richter plays Anna, an independent, out-of-work, independent neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who lands a desperation job looking for a wheelchair bound, subdued, aged father named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died at 77 o'clock shortly after this movie was made). <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he confronts the gifted Anna, whose whimsical and vicious way brings the poor old, violent devil back from a self-imposed death sentence. /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty that a ponderous businessman's son (JÃ¸rgen, played by Clausen) loves a father who has never accepted him. The film is against the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the character and value of loving and caring, and how a person, the irrevocable Anna, can change the life of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
