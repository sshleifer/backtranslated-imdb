Kasparov's or Fischer's biggest game can be a mess for a total rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is clue! This is a PRIVATE plot built as a private business. This is a self-destructive and independently organized plot. As a conclusion, the scenario describes the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. Everything can only be done by delegation. The "director" just has to trigger. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a real plot has fewer chances of being discovered. All the actors' performances are well-finished, with particular attention to Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
