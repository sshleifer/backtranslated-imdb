Does anyone know where this movie was shot? The aviation scene on the rock is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building, with its fascinating lifts. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Perhaps he was the man's lawyer, but again I do not remember that the character is in the movie, except to be mentioned as having made a phone call. Maybe he was in the aviation scene? Or the ballroom scene? Has anyone found him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this movie.
