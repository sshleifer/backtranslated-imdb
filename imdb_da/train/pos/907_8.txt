This film is a great attempt to revive traditional Indian values ​​that are being replaced by Westerns. It is a common family history that shows all the ethics that each person must follow while communicating with each family around. Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 achievement as a desi to associate knot with Amrita Rao, who is also very Desi, and she also works well ... The film's genre is the same as HAHK, and such films deserve to be made in India to revival of old traditional values ​​.. The movies do not get 10, as it is not very good with music that counts a lot in each movie, besides this it is flawless ....
