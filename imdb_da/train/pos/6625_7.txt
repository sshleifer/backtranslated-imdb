If you've ever seen a trailer for the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch the movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance has had similar revelatory trailers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance is about a detective examining the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements are decorated throughout. The special thing about Renaissance, however, is its visual style and not its history. The Renaissance is 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but very stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks great (although the 3D animation problems of people are still visible from time to time: little robot movements, little wood facial, etc.) As a highly stylized, beautiful film noir, the Renaissance manages to impress the audience, especially visually. The story and the writing, however, are not quite at the same level of quality as visuals. It's not a bad story (and probably if you haven't seen the trailer, it's much more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original and verges on corny. A few lines of dialogue were painfully corny, making the writing sound like a beginner's first effort. I would definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. It is in contrast to something I have seen before visually, and I believe that its originality alone makes it a valuable experience. It's also a clear story, even though it's not perfect.
