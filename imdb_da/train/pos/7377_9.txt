This film is virtually impossible to describe. The alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinemas, history is not as linear as American cinemas. The story is about a director filming a story of a ww2 deserter. The set is haunted (?) By an actress who died (?) During the recording of a television show back in the 60s. the director is the only one who saw this show. If you've seen Ringu (director Hideo Nakata the same) and liked it, you'll like the ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress much more than ringing. a really scary and disturbing movie. and 10!
