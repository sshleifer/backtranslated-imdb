I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but at the moment let me quote a few the remarkable dialogue that is remembered that every tongue is in cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else-well? <br /> <br /> (title lyrics) "He can sink a beer, he can choose a queer, in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear." <Br /> <br /> (another song lyric) "All pommies are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is a universe's ** e-hole." <br /> <br /> (during a TV interview on an "arty program"): Mr Mackenzie, which artists have impressed you most since you were in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin 'bull artists! <br /> <br /> (while chatting to a naive young pom girl): Mr Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen a life in my life. Mom makes most of the fixed yacca (ie hard work) around in our room. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this pimp Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it, look and enjoy.
