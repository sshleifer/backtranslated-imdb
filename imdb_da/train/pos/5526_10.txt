I love cinema, so what I'm about to admit deeply embarrasses me. I had thumbs down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt in a trap committed by ... who? I don't really know, but there has been a negative word in mouth that spread like wild fire, and no matter how smart I think I am, I fell into it. But fortunately I came across an argentine film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I didn't want to see it because I knew the movie was a mistake, he looked at me as if he were ready to hit me straight on the face, and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I went to see both instantly and "Che, Part 1 and 2" is the best movie I've seen in 2008. It is such a purity that it reminds you of some of the great gentlemen of the past. Consideration to the public is something we are not used to anymore. I don't know if we were ever. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro are just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. Mankind is overwhelming. So thank Martin Donovan again for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this milestone movie. Do not continue the mistake I was making. Go see it now, on the big screen
