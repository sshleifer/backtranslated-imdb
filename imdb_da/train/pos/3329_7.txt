The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I have been in love with since the 9th grade, which was his first year at SNL. I'm a die-hard Yankees fan and I didn't find the movie painful for the last 15 minutes when they start showing clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small sounds so I didn't have to hear what shouldn't be heard, but otherwise it was quite tolerable. I thought Jimmy had played the role really well, because the character should be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy. I know it may not be an Oscar-winning movie, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that really suits both women and men to watch. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better camera chemistry than other players in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in the stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because Taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone has to stop being so critical of his ability to train because he has just started filming. I can imagine that it should be difficult, and if you look at any of the other major players of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they started in some flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here Jimmy wants a successful career on the screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
