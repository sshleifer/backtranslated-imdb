From what critics and audiences stated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker. Still because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It turned out to be pretty worth seeing. Sure, it's not your basic American comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies around, a fresh breath. Sure, there were some plot holes, but generally it worked. First, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. She just proves that she is one of the best talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effectively, but there are times when she spends long conversations in Russian, and if you didn't know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have noted in "K-19". All in all, a small movie that works despite the terrible buzz.
