In New York, family doctor Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) randomly on the street. Charlie became a lonely and frightening man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan is having trouble discussing his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan resumes his friendship with Charlie and they get close together. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life and sends him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive response to the treatment and is being sent to court. "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; It could be a car accident, a fire or another tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, backed by the amazing performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is completely impossible to recognize, I don't know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is weird. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
