Absolutely enjoyable song and dancing movie with Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The movie won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it won nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly and Best Cinematography as well as a Best Son nomination for "I Fall In Love Too Easy" song of Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a sweet story about Kelly helping her friend Sinatra get a girl and fall in love with herself. The lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with his song, and we had many good songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the pianist Jos√© Iturbi's artist. <br /> <br /> A classic Hollywood music from an era passed.
