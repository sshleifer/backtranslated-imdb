Hardcastle and McCormick are a great TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictably similar to The Hinkard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc., etc. etc. This show is just good clean tv. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite fun. They often take jabs on each other several times an episode that adds a lot of humor to the show. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who doesn't have a good car chase? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just want them to clean TV like this today, I highly recommend it!
