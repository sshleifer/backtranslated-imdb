Why should you see this? There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't see it! Superbly and entertaining directed by Albert and David Maysles, Gray Gardens was originally supposed to be a film about the East Hampton gentrification, but it turned out for the brothers that it would be more interesting to do a study of the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales, aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was definitely an entertaining one (Edith spent most of his day in bed and sold operas, Edie performed pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one named Ted Z. Kennedy) The film is interesting because it is both fun and sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released (in February 1977) aged 82 after experiencing part of the fame she and Edie received after the movie (she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr. was born in 1925 and still live in Miami Beach.This movie is both engaging and spellbounding.
