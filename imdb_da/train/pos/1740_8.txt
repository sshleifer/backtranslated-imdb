This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece, although it became good actors, big script and pretty good photography was not a so-called "blockbuster" movie in my country. The movie itself is very powerful, it's about the hard time a newcomer might go through when he returns in his hometown after being released from a 5yo prison period (drugs). The end is pretty sad .... Mourikis tries to quit his part and he handles it pretty well ... Lambropoulou is amazing and very sexy in a weird way, and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to excellence ... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression!
