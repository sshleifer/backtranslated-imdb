Published in December 1958, Bell Book and Candle features James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This movie had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second pairing on the screen (after Alfred Hitchcock Classic Vertigo, released earlier that year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic lead when he was considered 50 years old to play that part longer. The movie is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted to a deadly player James Stewart. She puts a magic on him and he falls over his heels in love with her. I enjoyed the movie and its cast. This movie at that time was a moderate success, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Movie Comedy. GimmeClassics
