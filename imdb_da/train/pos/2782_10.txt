"Bend It Like Beckham" is a movie that has very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably because the film was heavily British in dialogue and terminology and participated extensively in football (football here), which some may also have problems with in the United States. It is unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage above. I think the background for the big-line (after a dream) is something many people can relate to, and finally, "Bend It Like Beckham" shows a good emotion with inspiration and really good acting. I was not too excited to see this movie initially, but now I do not regret seeing it before. I highly recommend this movie!
