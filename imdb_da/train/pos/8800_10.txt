First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Sure there are moments when the US is directly accused, as in the segments Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and to some extent Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and proven facts, and all the documents published by the CIA on Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie itself, what I enjoyed most was the different moods we find in it. We find that children are trained to respect all the people who died in the event; we find an unhappy couple who will be changed by today's tragedy we find ordinary people who have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for whom the fall of the towers is a moment of real happiness. All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent mix and help the viewer gain an insight into how different people spread throughout the world responded to the events of September 11th. Thus, we see a panorama that is much more complex than white and black, and it can cause some people to confuse; But that is the world we live in, and there is no room for manicheist ideologies, no matter what presidents or priests can tell us. Finally, I think it's a pity that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the US. It's a shame because most Americans are asking why this disaster happened, and this movie could provide some traces to them. This film makes very clear - different from what some people in this forum believe - that everything we do today determines our future, and that past failures will affect how we live today.
