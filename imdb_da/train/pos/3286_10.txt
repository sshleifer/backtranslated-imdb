Simply this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> It simply starts as a study of a rebellious young girl and continues to be a beautifully crafted horror movie. Do not expect to do or zombies. This is psychological, and just as he would in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize more about what happens and how the two worlds of this movie connect. <br /> <br /> Drawings have never been scary.
