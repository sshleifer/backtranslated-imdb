A French novelist, wild of his wife's community friends, goes to North Africa for a break. There he meets a lively and talented Bedouin girl who lives in poverty. Despite his wife who is a romantic Maharajah, he decides to train and educate the girl and present her to the Parisian community as PRINCESS TAM TAM ... The amazing Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role of this very entertaining French film. With her huge eyes and contagious smile, she immediately contacts the viewer's heartbeat. Her oversized personality and the obvious joy of doing make her a pure pleasure to see. Baker makes us aware of what's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation and introduction to European Moors. Albert Préjean does very well as Pygmalion for Baker's Galatea; Also effective is Georges Peclet's half-servant, and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well made and looks a bit like recalling that Busby Berkeley films are produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films during this time, PRINCESS TAM TAM doesn't some racism. It should be emphasized that there was no Hays Office or Production Code in France. Some of the dialogue and action are quite provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker sings and dances to 'Under The African Sky' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, two of the cinema's more memorable moments. /> Actual location movie in Tunisia enhances the movie. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906 to a very poor family. Her talent and driving ambition, however, quickly shot her into moving east and she was briefly a cast member of Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that America in the mid-1920s had great limitations on a gifted black woman, she managed to get to Paris, where she eventually joined Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French loved her, and she became a great celebrity. A brief return to America in 1935, Baker showed that things had not changed for African Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for resistance in the early days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for the duration and entertained allied troops stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's happiness began to slip and she faced many financial and personal difficulties. For a while she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to stay in the Principality. Josephine Baker was heading for a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming unclear. But she deserves her place with Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of her generation's true legendary artists.
