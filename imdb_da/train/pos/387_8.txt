This movie is good. It's not the best of the big CG kung fu flicks, but it's pretty good. First thing first is the story actually good. The whole idea of ​​gods vs fallen god type dealing with superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many signs! It became very confusing when they switched scenes! The special effects were inedible! The fighting situations were very fast and complex. This movie almost all computer generated. The action is amazing, as always expected of such high-profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, lonely character. Zhang Ziyi didn't do anything for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger role but she did a fight scene and a lot of yapping. The bad guy, the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very scary. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just a movie. There is too much history to get hold of for 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the signs and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of history to action. I reccomend Storm Riders over this any day.
