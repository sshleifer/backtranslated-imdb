One of the most cordial warming foreign movies I've ever seen. The young girl is a fantastic talent. Stellar performances by her (Doggie), the old man (the king of masks) and Liang (Living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The regrettable treatment of children, especially women, is worrying. /> <br /> Loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue increases the emotional intensity of the performances and history. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST SEE - fun family movie, even if it is not for very young children. Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the audio track had been transferred better to the DVD and the download had included the widescreen version.
