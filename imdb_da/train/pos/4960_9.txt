This movie is a little sunbeam in a dark season. It celebrates a quality best described as ordinary old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character like Freeman himself - a successful actor who pushes 70. He has traveled to a small, slightly ugly merchant who intends to investigate a part he can play as a leader of such a place. He soon desires the employees and customers, especially the lovely, whose cranky, young woman (Paz Vega) manages "10 or less" cash. <br /> <br /> 10 items or less do not have a big statement to make and do not do as it does. It follows Freeman and Vega when they become friendly, and as the older man offers his advice in return for a trip home - the movie company gof to pick him up never shows and Freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can't call for help. I had a small case of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City, and this flick heals what mocked me.
