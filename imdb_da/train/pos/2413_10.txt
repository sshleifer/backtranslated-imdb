Love the TV show. Was hooked the first time I saw it. Wish I was there shopping with them. It affects reality when you love someone, and you think that you will spend the rest of your life with, then at an event, that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone gets hurt, it doesn't stop. Making the decision is difficult, but you will continue to be unhappy when you could have been. Why go ahead and live a life that you thought you would have or think you are doing right and you are both unhappy. The other person is not expecting a lifetime, they have a good life. Making the decision you really want will improve eventually. Making the best of what you have is a good thing good. Money, cars, houses etc. .... don't make you happy, have one person you really want to share it with do.
