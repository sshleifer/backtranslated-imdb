A well-run run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long feedback on why he is there. The music. An uninterested look at police life. Minuses: Violence and doing, but I suppose they add realistic effects. Nevertheless, one could avoid having people's heads cut and sent in boxes and bags. No complaints - 7/10
