What can be said about a movie that has one of the hardest, most nihilistic, and sometimes weirdest - I don't want to say 'sympathetic'. I would say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the cinema and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly brave and honest man fighting for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
