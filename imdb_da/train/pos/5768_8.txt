A breakdown on a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to become lethal, rat-faced, shambling zombies who obviously go on a pig rampage. A ragtag handful of uninfected people are doing their best to survive this cruel ordeal. Director / co-author / producer Todd Sheets shows an appealing sincere love and passion to face the lively and cruel horror prize: he maintains an incredibly dirty pace all the time, filling the screen with walls of crazy action, and fortunately holding the terrible dialogue to a comfortable minimum. In addition, Sheets certainly does not shade on the glorious graphic and exaggerated over-the-top splatter: this image delivers a tasty load of meat melting, extraction, lots of intestinal munching, a guy's heart anchored, and even a Nice impalement on a tree branch. Sheets earn bonus points to keep the tone rude and unpleasant to the literal end (for example, almost all the main characters become a zombie show). Permitted, this flick has its fair share of errors: the ragged editing, several ham-fisted attempts at pathos, and the largely awful appearance of a rank-no-name cast all leaving a great deal to be desired. Top thespic honors go to the beautiful and perky Kasey Rausch for her winning spunky depiction of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay also does well as a robust take-charge army veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets' understanding of an infectious slambang sense of unsustainable headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensures that this is a total blast to see from start to finish.
