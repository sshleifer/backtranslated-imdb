Released a few months before the end of the war, "Anchors Aweigh" is one of Gene Kelly's great musical triumphs in the eighties? <br /> <br /> Under the leadership of George Sidney, did it have the benefits of a comfortable score, and best of all, Gene Kelly services in its first real lead on MGM ?? The year before, he had revealed in Columbia's "cover girl" an innovative approach to dancing on the screen, a bright but comfortable singing voice and great charm in "anchors aweigh" even though he was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, he fixed it foundation for its most revealing years at MGM ?? <br /> <br /> The story of the movie, a kind of dry run for "On the Town" four years later, follows the sailors Kelly and Sinatra on land leave, spending their vacation in Hollywood, where they get involved in cases of an aspiring singer ( Grayson) and her little nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> Grayson seems to have her heart set on audition with conductor pianist Jose Iturbi ??

He also does a charming Mexican dance with a little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles ?? The highlight of the movie, however, is Kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character Jerry Mouse (of "Tom and Jerry" fame). Delightful and innovative combines the skillfully live action and animation in his tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor in the "Pomeranian Navy" wearing a striped shirt and a beam shows him how to dance?? "Look at me, I'm dancin '!" says the merry mouse king ...
