I watched this movie on TV late one night ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has been with me this day. The principle may seem a little unoriginal - because of an earthquake, a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills over a small town is broken, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply. The city's inhabitants are beginning to lose their ability to exercise restraint over all the whim and whims flowing through all our minds from time to time, and what we normally know is simply not to act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow, but for me it is only added to the creepy discomfort as the city's behavior slowly begins to rave. There are several surreal and very disturbing scenes that have been etched in my memory all the time. <br/> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we could all do if we gave in to our most wild instincts. Did I Need It I'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. Did it make me think? Definitely. I'm still thinking about it. Scary things.
