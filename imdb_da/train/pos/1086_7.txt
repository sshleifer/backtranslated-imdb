This movie is a bit unusual because it has a very slim plot and the movie itself is made at a very slow and relaxed pace. Though this makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it is still very visible and entertaining. It's as if someone said "Let's just follow Cary around and see when he gets disturbed at all the little problems that come up when you have a house rehabbed". Considering what a fun actor he's in the movie and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has rather modest predicates, it gets the most out of the material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
