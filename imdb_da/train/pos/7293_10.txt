What do I say about such an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw this at Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considering that this is my main city. I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type movies. I was getting up all night and was calling it one day when I noticed the movie that was playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi or action movie of any kind. Let me just start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari, after seeing some episodes (his performance in it seemed stale and robotic). But he really managed to win me in this performance. I mean really win me over. After seeing Cellular, I didn't think there was much in the way of shopping for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much in-depth detail in this character, it was totally amazed at me. I looked later on the web and found that Eric won the Best Actress Award, which is well-deserved given his best career and got my respect. Now I continue to read about, for example, this and the production of this project and let me just say that I have not noticed them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely finished, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more his goal (Watch movies like Godzilla with great effects, I really got rid of). I couldn't sleep after this movie thinking it over and over in my head. The situation of a violent family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so they had been abusing. This is a movie I constantly think about and would highly recommend.
