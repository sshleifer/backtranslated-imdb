Why does this have such a low rating? I really don't understand ... Is it because of the bad action? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies? Seriously, the action and dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate movies only because of bad acting and poor dialogue should not be allowed to judge cheesy low-cost movies. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was expecting a gorse party, but it is not a gore party, and gore is pretty bad (mostly it is only animal floats placed on the actors' body, and it is lamb) movies are fun! The characters are hilarious, the play is fun (plays are a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies), the dialogue is fun (bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies), the zombie rapist with a big cock is fun, the flying demon baby is fun and i could go on and on, but i dont want to say too much ... BUT i have to mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates a sex doll as if it is live lol! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> Best lines in the movie: Detective Manners: * Sniffs Coke * Detective Sloane: What * beeps * do you, Manners? What the hell did you snore? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: It's not a man, it's ... Ehh ... Cold Medicine ... Detective Manners: * injects heroin into his arm * Detective Sloane: What * beeps * do you, Manners? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: It's cold medicine. Detective Manners: * Repeatedly kicking a random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This madman was wandering about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock! He just started smashing his head on the rock! I think he's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
