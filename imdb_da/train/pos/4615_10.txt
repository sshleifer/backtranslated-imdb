I think people are considering this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror movie that is pronounced to scare us and prevent us from getting a little sleep. Which if it tried to do so would deserve a 1/10, but I watched this movie with a couple of friends and we found it very entertaining and even though it was a good movie after all it has Stephanie Beaton. This is why I think it deserves 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The general perception of this movie is that it has bad plays, a simple manuscript that a 10 year old could produce and that it cannot be taken seriously, and people rate it low because of this. But I see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... which has a fun fun script that is made even more entertaining by the actors, and although it is not very serious, it is very entertaining.
