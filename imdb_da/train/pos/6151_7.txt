I will always have a soft spot for this Disney-flick, another of their part live action / party animation items that attempted to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never quite done it. When I was in a school, we once had a film day where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria, and a movie would be projected the old-fashioned way, more wheels and all. At that time, it seemed like an important occasion when this day arrived, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember watching. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's quite charming. Angela Lansbury never put her name on something that was not least competent and she wins here as a witch with a magical bed (boy who could be misunderstood, couldn't it?) Who can take her and a couple of young children in magic adventure to remote places. Come on, which kid doesn't want a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Degree: A
