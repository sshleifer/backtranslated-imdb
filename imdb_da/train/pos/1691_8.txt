This movie is fun and suitable for any age. It's definitely family-type entertainment. The game does a fine job of people in the middle western city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we have to assume that nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the Interstate. The location appeals as appropriately boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of the land by the Martians. But these Martians are completely inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of appropriately horrible and deadly weapons ... including a set of exterminating the Martians too! The Martians kill their lines and just throw the right accents to get us the viewers and the locals wanting to help them ... leaving the ground. J. J. Anderson plays the very young Halloween carnivorous duck, has equal lines. Watch this movie for the weaker and the entertainment; Thoughtful it is not. But subtle and pleasant is it.
