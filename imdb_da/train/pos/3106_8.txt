When I hadn't seen the movies before (and couldn't stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to see the Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to watch it for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon in it could be fun. <br /> <br /> Quick combat scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and huge explosions were what threw you out of your seat in the TBU. The almost missing between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, several things really tore my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact was that the movie was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repeated and eventually boring. Even though Damon kept us entertained and always seemed a step ahead of the CIA, I was slightly annoyed by Bourne's constant survival. He crashed a car and came out as if he had dropped it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaken, it was quite noticeable and got me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even mentors) seasick. We were told by supervisors that if we ever used it in a movie we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there and saw Damon and Stiles hold a conversation, but surely we wouldn't shake our heads so violently! <br /> <br /> All in all, TBU is a fun movie and worth seeing. But I didn't think it was the best movie of the year, even though it was an entertaining piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
