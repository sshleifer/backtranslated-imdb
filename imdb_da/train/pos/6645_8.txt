An ultra-modern house in a wealthy neighborhood seems to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and lethal) behavior. Or at least that's what Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Col Kennedy, argues for. After a series of deadly events in a gigantic house next door, Col knows something has to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is also the mysterious architect. My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the places (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention amazing. She brings credibility to her character and makes the movie exciting. Without her, it would have failed. "It is so alive" declares a potential buyer in connection with the house. Yes, it lives. But the story itself is not so much. Barring Boyle's presence does not happen much here, as a huge amount of movies are spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography gives the film a polished look. 8/10 because of Boyle, the prerequisite for an evil ultra-modern house, placements and filmography, and set decoration and wardrobe.
