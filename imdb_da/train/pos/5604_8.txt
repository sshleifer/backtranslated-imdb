If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you should probably check "The Tenant" as it is a similar concept, just like Polanski, who enters and plays the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorites of his movie - secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course - and is a straightforward journey into a mental breakdown in a man moving into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers keeping down the noise level - even the smallest 'look' becomes a big thing, and Polanski, as stars, is becoming more and more paranoid and survives to his loony hallucinations longer and longer as the film carries on. It comes to the point where he dresses and acts as the former tenant, and you realize that it is only a matter of time before he decides to rethink her deadly leap through the window ... The movie is a little slow and dawdling for a man, but if you've ever seen a Roman polanski movie, you know it's going to end up with a bang, and this flick does not disappoint. It is also best if you do not question the intricacies of love and just take it as a descent into madness, because it is pretty trippy at times surreal. Polanski is very good as the modest resident who somehow attracts the always famous Isabelle Adjani. We'll also see him running in a row, which is disturbing and fun all at the same time! Damn, he does for a nasty chicken! So, Polanski fans - who can actually see past their thirty-year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy "The Tenant" as an entertaining psychological tour ...
