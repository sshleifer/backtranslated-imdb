Passing to Pimlico is a great experience for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it is a cinematic flashback of a bygone age, with attitudes and scenarios unfortunately now only a memory of British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton, who after an accidental blast of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century Duke of Burgundy buried deep under their small suburban street over the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Included tax is an ancient decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially abolished) to state that the London street in question had been declared Burgundian land, which means that, according to international law, Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects, but native of Burgundy and their small street an independent independent country and a law to themselves. <br /> <br /> This puts war-impoverished and poor resources in good condition as they believe they are out of English law and jurisdiction, so in a bleak crimes crime they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly ignores British licensing laws, etc., which declare themselves fully independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> But what is happening is ever spiked, black marketer and dishonest scare follows suit and crossing the border with Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their risky goods and half of London's Consumers follow them to dodge the ration, make their quiet happy little harbor, a twenty of twenty, and a rather crowded one there. <br /> <br /> Appealing to Whitehall for help, they are told that due to the development, "now a foreign policy issue that his Majesty's government is reluctant to get involved" leaves the residents tall and dry . However, they declare the area a legal border and set up as a fully-equipped customs office at the end of the road, primarily to monitor smuggling than to provide security for the residents of Pimlico. <br /> <br /> Finally, the border is closed entirely with a great siege, where the Bugundian residents slowly run out of water and food, yet never struggle in true British style. Like a buggy resident quotes, "we are English and we were always English, and that's just because we are English, we are struggling so hard to be Bugundians" <br /> <br /> A feeling that soon echoes in The entire capital, which, when the rest of London learns about the poor bugundians, feels they all have to flip in and help them throw food and supplies across the threshold blocks. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall who has fought so over the centuries can finally be brought to the knees of this new group of foreigners, especially as these are English !! <br /> <br /> Great narrative and fun all the way through. Not to be missed.
