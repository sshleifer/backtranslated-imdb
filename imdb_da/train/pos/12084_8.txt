A gum small pot boiler whose length of 65 minutes does not appear to be a second for short, My Name is Julia Ross is stuck to an English tradition of things that are not what they think - Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is an example. Outside work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job in a new employment agency in London whose monstrous representative seems very eager to determine whether she has a family or a boyfriend. After signing up for the duty, she wakes up (has been slain) in a large Manderley-like pile on the Cornish coast, apparently like George Macready's barmy-in-the-crumpet wife, showing an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. His doting, which allows mum, is the irresistible lady May Whitty (this time a model of busy efficiency on the other side of good vs evil than she possessed in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this story unfolds claustrophobically; We know what's going on, but are powerless to tell poor Julia. This film, curiously, regularly gets an honor as one of the earliest (and very few British) films noirs. I think it is closer to the gothic old-dark-house tradition than the American of cobblestones and urban corruption; however, it provides a more modern, psychoanalytic casting of the mind. Whatever you call it, it remains a sharp satisfying thriller.
