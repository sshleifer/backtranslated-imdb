This may be the only movie that actually comes close to capturing movies, the essentially unimaginable world of the American college experience of the late 60s-early 70s. Go ahead, name another movie that even approaches this one: "Immediately"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but it is a retrospective film about (self-imposed) individuals more than a movie about a time and place depicted * at * time and place. "Drive, he said," depicts - with subtlety and nuance wherever it is going, and a quick kick in the shorts where it's the only appropriate way - the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of high-time college sports (especially when is a war on), the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves a prize (like the director of course), but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern as a basketball coach and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - except for the time - loves the interest. William Lepper, who heads, also speaks a true applause round for his perfect capture of the student's athlete and for actually playing real college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes!). <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic of a kind - and the last movie currently in 6th grade, has to write comments ("boring", "deterrent" - um, right, sonny) , Please go back to your Arnold movies). Why isn't this movie available from imdb?
