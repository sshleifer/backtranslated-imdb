Do you ever have or do you have a pet that has been with you through thick and thin who you would lose without and who you love, no matter what? Betcha never thought they felt the same about you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft place for animals, it is guaranteed to make you cry regardless of your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a toddler and I find it now, at age 16, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very genuine and pleasant, as a loving but feuding family. I love Chance, and finally he says he finally has a family. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is supposed to be a family movie and it fulfills that role perfectly. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for the young adventurous chance. The animals stand out over humans, but of course, most of the tearful moments are having an interaction with them (ie, rescue Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives every moment even more emotion and an accompanying heart-raising feeling. I give this 9/10. To be compared to (and even better judged) Cats and dogs and Babe.
