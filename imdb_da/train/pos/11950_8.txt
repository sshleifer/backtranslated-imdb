I went into this movie and didn't know anything about it and really ended up with it. It lacked authenticity and credibility. Some of the things that the characters said and did were quite bizarre, and much of the script seemed to be ad-libbed (perhaps it is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance), but the entire audience in the theater was so laughing. It wasn't even in the jokes in the movie itself, but on the whole the film itself. The act reminded me of Seinfeld's play, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes - they are corny, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate ACTORS 'humor, not the CHARACTERS. If you are looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
