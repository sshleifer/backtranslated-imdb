I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this movie) when it was first released and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways that "otherness" (his own and the Amazon people with him lived and loved) into a way to live a decent life. His subsequent books were not so powerful, but showed his continued search. His description of his sexual relationship with tribal men was far ahead of his time in the early 60s, but his honesty and openness about it was welcome. This film beautifully conveys both the man's quirkiness and generosity, but also gives an insight into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive expression in this case) that arises when "civilized" men penetrate traditional communities. Nevertheless, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence, suggesting the possibility of saving humanity from its own destruction.
