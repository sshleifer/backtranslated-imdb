If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", 01, you will love his performance as a guy who never gets a smooth break in life and blows around with shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and on At the same time many gold bars. Alvin Sanders has lots of FBI eyes looking at him and winning up to being hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so-called fish hook to attract criminals. There are lots of laughs, drama, cold blood drops and excellent movie spots and lots of expensive cars sent to the scrap yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were excellent actors in this movie and it was great entertainment throughout the picture.
