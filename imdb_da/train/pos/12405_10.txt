Captured this movie in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what I was in. Many horror fans may have missed this mindset, it was a typical prison movie and those who got it did not like it as it did was what they wanted to see. The above factors are probably the reasons why it is low rated, but just ignore it and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to action and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a movie I still have on video for this day. Check it out.
