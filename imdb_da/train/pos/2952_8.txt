Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors - her depiction of a lonely, pointless nomad is top notch. A teenaged Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of the country's most popular actors in the years to come with future roles in BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING OF ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET Life of Us (On the other hand, Karvan as a child was a young girl whose toy panda was stolen outside a pharmacy store in the 1983 drama, GOING DOWN with Tracey Mann.) If these movies come your way, be sure to watch it! ! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANTPOSSESSION, LANTANA.
