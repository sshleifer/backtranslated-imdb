I see this at the World World Network abroad, which buys American and Canadian series that hold one or two seasons as The Jane Show. I was wondering how many female lead comedy I can actually see on my own, that is Lucy, Bewitched, I dream about Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes blank, I can't think of anyone else, the women does not support all roles management. So for me, The Jane Show is in a good company. One thing I have just thought of. I've seen several things in Canada, and I never remember anything filmed in a regular TV show showing SNOW! It's all made in summer, LOL! Granted, it is a good place to live wisely in the summer, but you would think they would show a little Canada in the winter, as it is also part of the lifestyle there. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs come to think of as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in Canada, and very little or no one is shot with snow present, though they both do many outdoor shots. I'm diverting myself, but I'm a kind of chuckle with Jane and her obvious liberal ways of being accused of racism for her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his fragility. I found it on a par with a British series called The IT Crowd (I Think) another office comedy with a female management. Not in any way the best comedy ever, but for a guy to say he can see it alone, it says something. If I was with my wife, she could really enjoy it as it deals with sex in the office and things like that, so it might be a good comedy for couples to see. 7 out of 10.
