This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I've been in stage production a few times, so it will always remain my favorite musician and I doubt anyone could ever make the story of Oliver Twist on the screen better than this one did. <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite '' bad guy '' should be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did he scare life out of me when I saw it as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman I can empathize more with Nancy's character, the bar's maid / prostitute, who helps Oliver with the life he deserves. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde as the artificial dodger was great, and I don't think anyone could ever perform him as the street picker and Fagin's best friend. The music is amazing, especially Fagin's numbers, I am also quite grateful that they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, it would not work with him being such a scary character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did an excellent job with Nancy's sticky ending, holding a G-rated movie by hiding her battles, but giving enough away to show Bill's violence against her. <br /> <br /> This movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing-along, as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs to life.
