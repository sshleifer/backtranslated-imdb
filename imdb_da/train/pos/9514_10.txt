This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good plays by Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Absolutely Jude Law's best performance. The kinematics are excellent, editing is just as good and includes a fantastic original score that fits really well with the movie's mood. Production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. For me, it takes a lot to beat the Godfather, but the amazing cinematography that is shown wins this competition. Definitely a best picture candidate in my book.
