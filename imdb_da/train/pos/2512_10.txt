Being a big fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde was very horrible when I found out that they had made a movie together and made it my mission in life to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, were prepared for brave but not really satisfying performances, but I am happy to say that both managed to keep me imprisoned and believe in the story as it happened. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious heartbreaking moments. I can't say I've ever been crying more on a movie and these more tender moments are admirably performed by the couple, in my opinion, showing their skills as actors. The battle scenes are amazing and even though there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and start tying with the characters. I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
