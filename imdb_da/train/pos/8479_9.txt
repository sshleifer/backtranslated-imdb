Seeing this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago, and now that I have found it again, it still has a movie experience as few others. If it is risky, it is a fantastic exhibition of morals and life-reads recommended for family viewing with young children. While still growing up as an adult, I was fortunate to have learned from it many times many years ago. Trying to find it today is difficult enough. . . But believe me it is well worth whatever age. Anime fans especially will find this a good recording for Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive artwork and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a valuable experience. While some of the lyric songs are not so hot when recorded in English, musical scores are still captivating. But even voice action is far better than much released today. Unfortunately, the print out of the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video and has not received any new format release for my knowledge, at least in the US. Look hard at it and you will be quite satisfied! It is an artificial, intense, enjoyable and important milestone in Japanese animation.
