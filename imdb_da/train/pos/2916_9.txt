Of all the movies I've seen, and that's most of them, this is by far the best done primarily about US Naval Airships (Blimps) in the WW II era. Yes, there are other good LTA-related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shot. This Man's Navy has significantly more real-time recordings of blimps, etc. True, lots of corny dialogue, but that's what makes more interesting Hollywood movies, even today. P. S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and have over 5,000 hours in Navy Airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Airship Association etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
