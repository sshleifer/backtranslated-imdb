I am a great Jane Austen fan and besides being a movie of my own length (a true fan wants to look as little discharged as possible and it can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was truly amazing. Gwyneth Paltrow really catches the little clueless but well-meaning rich girl and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly with his poise and nobility. I wasn't thrilled with Ewan McGregor, though I really like him as an actor, but it didn't feel so spoiled at all. As a Jane Austen fan, there were things I would have liked to see, it was not, but it would have made it much longer than allowed for a movie of its own length, and as it was I felt that they really encapsulated history well. I have seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best!
