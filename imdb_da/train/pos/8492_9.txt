Gung Ho is one of the movies I never get tired of seeing. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine and he is absolutely fun in this movie. Matching him step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two work well together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) who are fighting in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, and then they finally enter a fight (which is hysterical to see). First, they are both on the floor. So hunting for a chair jumps. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the table with him. The fight is then wasted from the office to the factory. I love it when they are separated by the workers, you can tell that they both feel bad to let things get out of hand. There is also a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro. He is at his house and his boss from Japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow not good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can't find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can't see Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's really fun, and also shows how people who are radically different can not only learn from each other but also become good friends.
