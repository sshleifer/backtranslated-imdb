The simple hand camera both gives almost documentary feelings to this movie and is also related to the dogma films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever been bored with the Hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get tasks James Bond would be envious? Fed up with the married-living-single-cop, the divorce-but-family man, the personified donut, and the hard hunter? Ever wondered how the real police work is like? <br /> <br /> For Germany, this movie shows you. Seen in the north between West Germany and East Germany, formerly the GDR, a dismissed post office worker starts his job, fresh from the Polish school. She quickly finds her way around the regular customers and gets used to life as police forces ... but it's not that fun. Other German crime films like Derrick, Der Alte et al., Worthy officers speak quietly with suspects. These cops must deal with the lowest of the social ladder here. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting view, even more if you know that part of Germany a little.
