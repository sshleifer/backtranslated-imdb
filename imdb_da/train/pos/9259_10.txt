It was simple and yet so nice. I think the whole feeling of gender segregation in society, which can be bitter, was very delicate. It had a bitter kind of lobster in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professional made the movie more tangible and more realistic. There was also a "documentary" page for the movie. The best scenes were those that all the girls who were banned from seeing listened passionately to the soldier who was watching them and sending out the game. If you are an Iranian, the familiar cheers and dancing in the street after a game won will fill you with national pride !! If you are not Iranian, you will still love it all!
