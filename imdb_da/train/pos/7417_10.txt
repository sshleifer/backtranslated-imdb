This beautiful story of an older son coming home and learning to love and be part of all the things he left home to get away from is exciting and moving. It shows a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes fun and cartoon. It has a sense of realism that we no longer see in our Western films. <br /> <br /> The play is unusual as the film's progress almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary for ordinary people. This is brilliant control and film making. <br /> <br /> Would love to see more movies by this instructor.
