For all of you who do not speak Swedish: The Swedish [original] title of this film; The "robbers" translate into something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the biggest problem I have with the movie because it is not about the robbers at all. It is a young woman who works for the Swedish police to investigate robberies. An ordinary desk job would be believed, but this girl is soon out on the field and takes matters into her hands as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers ... Exactly: We've seen this before. The fact that there is a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through does not really help, as the end is just like the clich√© as the first two thirds of the movie. What saves it to be just another mainstream movie is the fact that it is masterfully done in every way that the actors are as big as they are and do not overtake and that the director really manages to keep it as exciting as it is for most of the story. One thing I really loved about this movie is that it is music that puts the right mood when needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, giving a nice sense of reality to shootouts and car purchases scattered throughout the film. A great touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often tend to be typecasted, hurts the movie, because you know that he will not just play heroine's girlfriend and be a support person in the background, But it is something you have to neglect. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is an entertaining movie that steals more money in its plot than time from you. 10.7
