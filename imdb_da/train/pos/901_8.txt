Now ... Vivah is pretty good, but typically Sooraj Barjatya's movie. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The movie is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The big plus in the movie is direction, music and Shahid and Amrita's plays (especially the last scene). The movie starts with a common factor Indian movie --- A girl doesn't like her voice mother. The story is that the movie is a bit ordinary, but it's good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. Minus points are a common story of Bollywood movies. Overall I would say that it is twice to watch movies if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and of course love!
