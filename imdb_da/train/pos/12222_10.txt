I thought this movie was wonderfully plotted, it made me confused and my cousin looked at it with me. To tell the truth, I think the younger Kevin Dillon was hot. Haha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go with the policeman and that was wrong what he told her before his death "I was in you". I think that's what she gets to do what she did to him, and how does he tell her she's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were. Now I don't think I could ever trust a policeman myself. But to tell the truth it was quite obvious it was him, even though he would become a policeman, I would still be suspicious of him either. And it was fun when she sprayed him in the eye of the store. Hahahahaha.she was still stupid to go into the store again and so was the policeman dead HELLO !! It's called back-up. As these movies make me angry when people seem stupid and do stupid things. But that's what I think of the movie.
