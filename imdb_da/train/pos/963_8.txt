Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors, and I was worried that he made a children's movie because I would hate to see him leave his movies, I came to love: Visiting Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Most recently, he seems to be exploring new territory, and I think he succeeds. Still, this was the first of his films I had seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. By the way, I bought it without seeing it and was happy with what I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect children's movie and adults should also like it. The whole movie reminded me so much about the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed the movies because they didn't treat children as if they were stupid, nor do they. The dark underlying morality is there, but it's also as silly as any movie should be. I was not personally disturbed by CGI and prostheses. I want them to fit well and do not think children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a die-hard Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this. But I suggest giving it a shot. It shows that Miike is as diverse and talented as I supposed he is. He also continues to make his signature Miike movie outside these, which is very calming. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this, I suggest these Other Miike movies: 'Zebraman' 'Katakuris happiness'' Sabu 'and' The Bird People in China '. <br /> <br /> Good Work Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
