I've watched this movie a while back after ordering it to my friend, who is a great Dominic Monaghan fan. The film itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was Donnie Darko's kind of "wtf?" factor after the film was completed. Of course, with positive, negative points also come. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan also did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This may just be me, and I do not claim to be a serious critic in the way that I do not find myself capable enough, but he just did not seem to be convincing as an actor. But perhaps it's even more striking, because even though I'm not a critic, it gets my attention. To conclude, everywhere I think it is definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you should just have seen it.
