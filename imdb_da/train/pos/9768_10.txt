This is the best piece of film ever created. It's a masterpiece that brought me in the eye. I never forget my experience seeing it. I don't understand why people don't think like I do The dinosaur turns into a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator combined. This should be published on DVD in Superbit format so I can fully enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it. Whoppi Goldberg really becomes a life-color as a hard, gritty policeman who is against her will with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner, and so hi-jinx says at least. By the way I say the complete opposite of what's true, this movie is completely garbage.
