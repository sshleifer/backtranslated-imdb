This is not the comical Robin Williams, nor is it the crooked / insane Robin Williams of the latest thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without overdramatisation, mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But this is not a thriller in itself. This is more a mystery / thrill car through which Williams tries to find a sick boy and his keeper. <br /> <br /> Also, with Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama is basically like a news report until William's character gets close to reaching his goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertained, even though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect or entertain. It felt more like I saw a guy (Williams) when he actually did the actions, from a third perspective. In other words, it felt right and I could subscribe to the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is worth looking at, although it is definitely not Friday / Saturday night ticket. <Br /> <br /> It ranks a 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
