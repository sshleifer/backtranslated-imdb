This is the one movie to see if you are getting married or married. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult issues as abortion, adultery, juggling and family. The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing today is terrible in the world and this film will definitely make you think. <br /> <br /> A must see. I hope it will be distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the player and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs and a 10-star rating from me!
