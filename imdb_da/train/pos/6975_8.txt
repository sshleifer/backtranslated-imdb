If I had just seen the pilot in this show, I would have rated it a 10. I immediately joined this beautiful new world. Subsequent episodes have not fully lived up to the promise, but I will keep an eye on it and hope it will improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the play is first-rate. I do not mind that it does not seem to fit perfectly with BSG because I am so fascinated by the premise and let's see that they are two different shows. I am thrilled that both Esai Morales and one of my full-time benefits, Eric Stoltz, are back in my life (if only once a week), which I have missed both of them. This is a show that requires a little thought from the audience, and that is always a good thing. You have to pack your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem, and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and of course the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey seems to be a good trip.
