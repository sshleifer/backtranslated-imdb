Big rock candy mountain is amazing. I saw it when I was little and still doing this day. (senior in high school). If I could imagine heaven, that's how it would look. I wish I could live in the big rock candy mountain where the candy grows on trees. Zach Hyman is profs and my best friend. little rabbit foo foo is the man. It is so cloudy and colorful that I dream about it at night. In fact, my friend, there are 18 recently seen it for the first time and absolutely loved it. I recommend people of all ages to watch this movie. I have a big party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie. We will order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle. I find myself constantly watching clouds and wanting me to be the little girl to visit. thanks. Goodbye.
