How to Lose Friends and Aliens People are honestly one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It is not one of the "brutal" comedies that relies heavily on fix jokes and toilet humor, but instead moves at a comfortable pace and you will easily be attached to the unfolding tale. Simon Pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish outside the water and quickly loosens from the stand he once lived in England (the other two would be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting to the top of the Hollywood food chain is a difficult thing to do, as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first jab starring David Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run comedy, but it received lukewarm reviews from both critics and audiences. His second attempt is this movie, received fairly positive reviews from the majority, but was a flop in the cashier's office. I still haven't lost faith in him and I still want to be there when he wants to take the third shot. Other characters were well cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst did well in this movie as the angle of love of Pegg's character, but the spark that I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost. She needs to find it quickly, or she likes the consequences of being lost in "rom-coms" country forever.
