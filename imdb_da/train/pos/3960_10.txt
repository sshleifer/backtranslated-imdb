According to the director, this movie was popular in Asia. It is a little difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously, as most of his films are shot on a very tight budget. Almost no USD at all. But it is fascinating to find out that Mats Helge eventually does something that can be called an action movie. Ninja Mission is - I think - the best of all movies directed by him. Some special effects are very pleasant. This is not a "B" or "C" film. It's a "Z" movie - but an enjoyable and fun "Z" movie!
