EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son had fun watching all those funny birds and polar bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals at risk of disappearing. Exactly that problem should prevent all our planetary authorities. <br /> <br /> This documentary provides many amazing images that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a good job here, which gets high respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving EARTH the highest rate. I hope so much that those things will create a successor.
