"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died, and her father was married again. When her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very sweet to her and made her do all the chores around the house, cleaning up her two evil stepister. One day, the king sent a message to all the women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course, cinderella didn't get going, but her stepister did. Cinderella was very upset and thought she could not attend the Royal Ball until her fairy godmother seemed. Then she did some magic and made Cinderella in a beautiful woman, but she had to be back at midnight as it is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time and the clock strikes midnight so she runs out of the castle and loses her zipper. Then the wife orders the Duke to find the women who had the slippers. The Duke sought every house, but finally found the women that it belonged to, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney movies in 1950. This movie is about a magical adventure. At the start of the film, Cinderella was a servant of her own family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic, the whole life changed and finally found love. My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy god mother seemed to do her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the prince sang the song so this is love while dancing because they realized they are in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a young child because every little girl wants to live an adventure life.
