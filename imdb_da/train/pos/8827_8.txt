With a minimal budget, a maturity of eight minutes and a great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts I've ever seen. The actor's subtlety is really remarkable, as it does not end away until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what the brief is about, as you will be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the annual discovery of his one-man show: steering, writing and acting in this formidable card is the most remarkable effort I have seen this year. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
