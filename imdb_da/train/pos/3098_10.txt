I loved this show so much, and I'm so sad it was canceled, I thought it came back, but just two stupid weeks. It's terrible. I hate how we never find out how everyone ends up. it stinks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot but doesn't give time for good as Six Degrees. If they complain about the reviews, it was probably because they had a bad room because this was really a good show, something I could relate to and expected. JJ Abrams delivered, he is great, I want ABC to just trust him enough to complete the story. I loved the whole cast as well. I couldn't wait to see how everyone would meet at once. Everyone's story is now incomplete, now I never know if Steven and Whitney would come together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really such a downer.
