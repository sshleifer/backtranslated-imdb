"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I've ever seen. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has some fantastic visual and amazing matches. I especially love the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue.Truly original and refreshing movie and another Embalmer fine recommendation.
