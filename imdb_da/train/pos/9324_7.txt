I've read a couple of the reviews, and I'm a little sorry that much of the story seems to be shining. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie, and there's just so much that can be done in a movie - the US or Canadian - or anywhere. Colm Feore does at least for a recovery "F @ g-Hag" like myself, a good job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man - but playing sick. I mean, the man really can't be much more pale! Although you may never know it from the strip down near ... um, ending. <br /> <br /> If you need obsolescence, there are a few SKing movies you might like. <br /> <br /> The daughter of a restorative Alchoholic was the druggie brother {David Cubitt} who was the trick for me. I'll give him faith, he grew up fast and believe me, that's good. And as an exciting author, Moimeme, I can dig many of his insights and views. But I'm more prosy than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can be easy to please, but I enjoyed it. A nice story that fits well together - by the Canadians, quelle surprise. Just toed the line of 'Movie of the week', missing it by not being so pulled out, GREAT appreciated. And it was pretty cleverly depicted.
