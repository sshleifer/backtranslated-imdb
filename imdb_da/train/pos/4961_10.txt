Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched couples who come in the car and go about doing errands according to the need for one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a fantastic person who relates to one and all, while Paz Vega is the edgy cashier behind the "10 Items or Less" check out line, frightening customers and bored out of her opinion. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do that, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor that they both have. I want this movie to be realistic, I want this type of story to happen more often, I wish we should not go to the cinema to realize that we can actually connect with each other, even though we come from very different backgrounds. The film's message is based on the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other - a world where peace could be an opportunity.
