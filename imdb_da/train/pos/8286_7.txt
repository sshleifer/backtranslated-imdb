Larry Fessenden has been beaten by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake is obviously marketing the movie and the way the DVD could have been targeted. Clearly, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for people who expect something that will be horrific and immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told by the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the threatening world they cannot understand. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what is happening in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. Clearly, the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to live in another world. Miles' fear reaches a crisis point at the weekend in the country. That part of the New York State, with its winter landscape, barren trees, is playing chaos on the little boy's imagination. It does not help him meet a strange figure in the city, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. In the end, Miles' world comes down to him, and he can't do anything, even evoking the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent no matter how film she is. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has the opportunity to get closer to a son he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought he was extremely effective as the whole movie is Miles Own, takes on what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the needy Otis, a man who falls into the world for the way he has appeared. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
