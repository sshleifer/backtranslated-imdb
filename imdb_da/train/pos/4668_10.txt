This movie now appears on digital TV at least once a month, I've seen it a dozen or more times, and it never ceases to please me. If it were tomorrow, I would see it again. Such is the artistry that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the working profession can create, helped in no way by the excellent support trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in smaller roles. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply told, about an ex-con, a lovable immersion, struggling and succeeding with the so-called "new age technology" ie. computers and finding affection in the process. Although it is a tad (tongue in the cheek) impeccable, even incredible, the signs are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all, it is not a terrible method that is so prevalent today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers about how to make a great show from almost nothing ... except excellent talent.
