If you watch this movie, you know you want to see an extended video clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a good time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Cut of "Man in the mirror", "Let me be alone", "Happy criminal" and the Beatles "Come along".
