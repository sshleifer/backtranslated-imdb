This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concerns were at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a busy man who rents a Parisian apartment where the former tenant has committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he sets in motion and reintroduces events that they might have unfolded. The film is disturbing to a point, and it has the atmosphere of frightening fears that Polanski excels in, but it comes out too much like a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other better Polanski movies that employ with the creepy goings on in moody occasions. <br /> <br /> But as far as concerns are concerned ... unless I read too much into the movie, I have to believe that it was Polanksi's reaction to feelings of persecution, he felt at being labeled a sexual perversion and exposed from America. Don't judge him about one or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the proof of it in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
