This movie is not just about a school recording, it is never actually seen. But it just adds to the power this movie has. Its about people and how they handle tragedies. I know it was shown to the students who survived the Columbine shooting, and it gave a sense of closure to many of them. The action is amazing. All three major players (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Its one of the movies that makes you talk about it when you see it. It provokes discussion of not only acting but also of human emotions and reactions to all kinds of tragedy. It's a fogger, but it's worth it, and I want to see time and time again
