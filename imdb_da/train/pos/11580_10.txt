As another reviewer, Hanna's War is an excellent movie about an excellent person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, in my opinion, I do not agree that Miss Detmer as the management is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In fact, her performance is not detained by her beauty, but makes it even more violent in the sadistic brutal terror as a resistance she faces. Maruschka Detmer's performance is courageous, exciting, heartfelt or understood and completely credible. In other words, for me, "In the zone." from the opening credits. If you want to learn about someone else's suffering for something they believe in and entertainingly entertained, Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmer gives a try. My hat is also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother a very famous and famous actress who could have made an effort to go out with the movie. In this connection, it may be a team effort by two actresses, but not an All-around situation.
