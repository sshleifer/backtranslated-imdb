really great movies, one of the best I've seen. Stir and simple - like life, sometimes you cry, you laugh, and it's just beautiful. Not too much of anything, as it is supposed to be. Really loved the idea of ​​the movie, no one is bad or good, everyone or just people, sometimes make mistakes mostly because of the societal pressures, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you do not have reasons to get angry - you can do it, but eventually anger goes away, and then let love come back, even if it is difficult, there lies the true happiness. Great actors and cast, the movie really gets you in the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> lovely lovely lovely. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing it, especially if you like to see the lives of Italians ...
