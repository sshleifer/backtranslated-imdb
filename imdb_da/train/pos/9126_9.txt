This movie is excellent and wonderfully scored. Prince Oscar for music was really deserved (many people don't know he won one). I think it's one of the best movies to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A big surprise: Prince does a fine job and is quite good at communicating pain on the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their supporting roles. Very nice landmark film.
