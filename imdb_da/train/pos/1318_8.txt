I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it has a good score of 7.3 stars, but only a few of the reviews at the time I wrote this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space Cobra is the clever tale of a smuggler and villain who gets involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to exploit the forces of the planet. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what is lacking in modern sophistication makes it an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very suitable for a western audience and very easy to see. There are few if there are any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime beginners to see and enjoy. Space Cobra itself is witty and sympathetic. I can't say how much this is due to the English dub, or the intention of the spouse, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters I find really fun. The style is very thirteen Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative, and there is constant effort to move the story together. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends in a very downbeat dramatic note. I can't think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to make this so smooth and convincing. You are hardly aware that this is happening, but it is done so subtly and works quite naturally. You also really feel that the characters went on a journey and their lives were changed by the whole experience. Check if you can.
