Not so many movies have really exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have. They in business have some really scary looking instruments. Give authors Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch to derive the maximum make-you-squirm-in-your-seat shock value from their premises. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen is in a well-nuanced performance by Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose trains jump from the tracks early. An unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he begins to dwell on the thought of decay, even imagining where there is no, and equals decay with society's corruption in general. Having witnessed his incredible wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman), he got it with their pool kid, he decides to punish her. At the same time, he is under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, best known as Dr. Silberman from the franchise "Terminator") to do a service in exchange for the agent holding his mouth shut about Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to perceive everyone around him as decaying somehow, and he goes on a murder battle as police specialist Gibbs (the always welcome Ken Foree) fetches his track. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly has fun with the script. It allows for some really ugly and remarkably entertaining scenes that make as well as sympathy for the victims as the thrilling audience. The script gives Feinstone character some fine dialogue lines and is generally rather blunt and entertaining, with large doses of tone-white humor (which Feinstone orders a victim to "get their tongue out of the way!"). Brooke and I.R.S. agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are mostly pretty good. And the film does a great job of maintaining its momentum, as Feinstone, with its relentless drive to perfection, changes from respected professional to unheard-of killer in record time. Foree, always cool and fun to watch, is a little wasted in a standard problem-detecting role, but there is some pleasure in watching Boen play his slim-ball part for the hilt. Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide very pleasing eye care. And a prefect Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supportive role. But it is so much Bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth (excuse me for using this term) in his plum, which shares with total conviction. <br /> <br /> The "dentist" is one of the more original and interesting horror films coming out of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
