This film opposes the first as far as Care Bears' origin and Care Bear Cousins ​​goes. I don't want to deny it. But if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, then it's a very good movie. I remember seeing this in the early 80s (and then tailoring to the targeted demographic audience) and absolutely loved it much more than the first movie (not that I didn't enjoy the one either, it just seemed that have a little something extra for it). Sure it's darker than the first one too, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it is dark in a deeper kind of subtle way too (that children may not fully understand, but it can still be a little scared because of the atmosphere, it gives off, and adults see will surely be faster as I watch the movie now again in the middle of the twenties, where you pretty much have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But simply seeing it as a child, probably as I said it could have been a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. In fact, if something it gave me another fantasy game, I could play when I was age. I can't tell you how many times I used to let out that Dark Heart would imprison me, help me catch him Capture Bears, try to turn me to his dark side and other things like that etc. So this movie was also good for my imagination. And it also has great emotional depth to it too. I used to see it at least once a week. Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I have always believed it and I always want it). <br /> <br /> Now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear growing up without watching the movie, as good as it does. <br /> <br /> "What good is love and care if it can't save her?"
