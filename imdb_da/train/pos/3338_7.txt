Fever pitch is a funny enough movie. It has many fun moments (including a hilarious disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle, where all the heavy "she breaks up with me" happens, but it continues to be fun until the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is about fanaticism against the Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was also a boy. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
