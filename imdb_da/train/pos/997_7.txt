I agree with most other positions. Was it a comedy? a drama? for me it leaned a little too much on the comedy side. I could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was terribly constructed. Jamie keeps running in Julio and what is his name. In New York, how many times do you drive into someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how could Robert Pastorelli dig Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or a drama? But it was still entertaining especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed Kimberly Elise's performance, she is definitely a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who becomes viable.
