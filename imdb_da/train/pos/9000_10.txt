I first saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI at its premiere during the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Blood just blew us away with its pure enlistment, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, complete campiness and even more fun, and all in such great fun! Especially for those of you who enjoy all the Japanese chambara samurai and ninja movies, you should definitely see blood!
