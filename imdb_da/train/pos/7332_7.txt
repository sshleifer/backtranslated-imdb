I had seen the snippets from this as a child while I bought Blue Undergrounds set immediately because it was a Limited Edition, only now I fit it in my viewing program - and this is mainly due to Bakshi's US POP (1981) just opened on late night italian tv (see my review of the movie below)! <br /> <br /> Still, I found the movie to be a very good sword-and-Turkish animated epic with a particularly impressive look (the rather awkward roto-sourced characters were less) with a twist whose derivative score. The plot was again not original, but proved indisputably engaging at youth level and the leading characters evolved well enough - especially interesting is the scurvy isher Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; the hero and heroine are pretty gentle stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta portray the girl, so well-maintained (her bra can be torn off for a second) and half-naked to start (her little panties are forever disappearing her ass)! Yet it is clearly an action-oriented piece, and it certainly lives on this front (meaning Darkwolf is very wild); The final showdown, though short, is also handled and seeing our heroes progressing pterodactyls attacking the villains lair inside a cave. In the long run beyond the aforementioned Frazetta scenery, the main appeal of this movie to me is now its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days to see not only movies like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982 ), but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN and UNIVERSE MESTERNE (1983-85). <br /> <br /> Regarding the accompanying MAKING OF "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage featurette on animated film with swords and witchcraft, which is only available through the washed out VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It details the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action 'performances' (in a studio) of segments from the script - which would then be tracked, blended with the background and filmed. Still, having seen several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on Disney Tins and Looney Tunes, for example), it's not a very compelling piece ...
