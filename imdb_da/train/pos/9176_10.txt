This review comes almost 30 years late. Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and saw it repeatedly for 4 months straight! I just had to write about it! I was beaten and forgot something else existed when I watched this movie. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist of literature, portrayed by the most beautiful man! but what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly and more because Timothy Dalton was fully entitled to his role. He delivered an amazing and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like it! All the other actors are also very good. The whole movie was beautifully composed. I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and happy. It crushes me a little to say this, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E's P&J, which I think is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me back in school. I never came around to read the book seriously to know the line of history as well. Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy. The scenes and Mr. Dalton's voice infested me infinitely and finally made me read the book seriously, which is of course a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr.Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 rating.
