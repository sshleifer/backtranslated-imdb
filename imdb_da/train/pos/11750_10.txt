Saw this in the theater in '86 and dropped out of my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best damn baseball ever to have lived." <br /> <br /> You know how it's going to end, but it's fun to get there. The training scenes are very fun, but the best scene can be one when Jack and Reno try to watch Falcon's Viking's Monday Night Football game while trying a makeup dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one, and it's too bad that it is overlooked as a top notch comedy.
