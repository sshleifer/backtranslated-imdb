Quick and simple, I love this movie. As some others have mentioned, I am also, not from the south, indifferent to country music and have never worn a cowboy hat. (I've never driven around in a car with a dead body in my suitcase either, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is just great movie production. Shots in a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transferred to DVD. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing experience. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story in Texas, with amazing performances. Travolta is amazing. Next to "Pulp Fiction" it is the best thing he has done. It has been in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check this out !!! It's a 10 !!!!
