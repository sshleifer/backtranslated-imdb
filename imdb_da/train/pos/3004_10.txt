Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve several murders among the wealthy after a dog show. Normally, I hate too violent mysteries (like this), but I love this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just accelerate the story together), has a very brilliant storyline (including a solution to a local space word that was just incredible ) and has a very good casting. <br /> <br /> Powell is very suave and great as Vance - he doesn't seem to work - he's Vance! Mary Astor doesn't get much to do, but she adds class and beauty to the production. All others are also very good, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were fun. <br /> <br /> Basically an outstanding 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Well worth seeing. <br /> <br />
