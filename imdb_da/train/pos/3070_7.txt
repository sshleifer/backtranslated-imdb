"Panic" is a captivating, blurred genre film about an embroidering and conflicting medieval hitman's reconciliation of treason with a younger uninhibited hairdresser, his love of wife and son, his duty to his employer / father with his own identity. Although the film has a dull purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is a fantastic production in almost every aspect. The characters' clarity and sincerity in such an unlikely story can both fascinate and annoy the audience.
