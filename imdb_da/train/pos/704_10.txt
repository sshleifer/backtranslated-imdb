This movie, as a low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it is a low budget from the start, you can appreciate how good a story is, how well written the script is, and how well the filmmaker should produce something so wonderful with so little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a fantastic movie are here. Visuals, though shot on digital, were beautiful in places. The bizarre, dreamy feeling of the movie is particularly well received in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. It's such a trippy job, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that, I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from many of the repetitive films out there.
