My college professor says Othello can be Shakespeare's finest drama. I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. It was so surprising that he didn't instruct it, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that US players can play Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. Not that there was a British vs. American question about it. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses that it really deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is about race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and demonstrated the complexity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's a really good scene at the end of the movie, but I don't want to reveal the end. It's just worth seeing. I think they edited a lot of lines for 2 hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
