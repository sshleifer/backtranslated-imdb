A little pleasure in life goes down the old movie hall in the rental shop and picks things just because I haven't seen it. A great pleasure is occasionally taking the movie home and finding a little treasure like this one plays on my screen. Far before Elia Kazan became a brand that only gave remarkable movies (not good), he made this better than average drama. When you see it, you begin to see how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes are accumulated. Contrast it with his later films, where the drama is written great ... preferably large and uninhibited and outrageous. Kazan was more of a calculation promoter than a director. (um. no thanks) <br /> <br /> His future profits are only suggested here in the plot. The plague comes! But here is an atypical Richard Widmark, who plays a family man in 1951 and avoids most of the profits of that tropic; here is an almost visible Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos down (well for her); they are a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and less. Here is an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chat ship crew; Here is a beautiful moment when a hunt begins at an angle store and a bunch of birds shoots overhead that distinguishes the moment. It's the small successes a movie can offer where a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously escapes. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a personable, human-scaled movie, not the grotesque, exaggerated production that he and others (David Lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still shamelessly as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge. <br /> <I've just seen it twice, and I'm damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is looking for in the last scenes, but it doesn't look to me as a seer. This reminds me of both No Way Out and Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain and Naked City that you really should get hold of.
