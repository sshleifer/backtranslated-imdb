Beautifully crafted with a wonderful achievement from the Gretchen Moll, which captures such a stainless ordinary happiness in its work, and the restorations of the small films and photography are perfectly made and often hilarious. According to Harron, they no longer used film stocks and fifties style studio lighting even for the outermost places to give the color portions its distinctive look. Bettie Page saw the movie at Hugh Heffner's house (she is forty-three) with the producers there, but not the director if it became awkward if she didn't like it. Apparently, she seemed to the official inquiry she found disturbing. Some good costumes too. The idea of ​​the film started in 1993, but it was worth the wait. Portrait of her never seems to ring fake in all the pictures and excerpts of (horrible) movies that many of us have already seen. It would make an interesting companion with Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more comfortable viewing!
