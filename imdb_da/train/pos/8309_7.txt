It's always a good surprise when a movie made for TV turns out to be entertaining as Little Richard. This is a very watchful film about the story of Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by an actor named Leon, whom I have never seen before, but does a very good job. Like most TV films, this is a bit tamer than if it was made for Cinema, which is a shame because I am sure there is much we could have seen about Little Richard who was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious waste, which is the only thing that destroys the movie and eventually destroyed a very promising career. All in all, this movie is good and the play is above average a television movie. 7 out of 10
