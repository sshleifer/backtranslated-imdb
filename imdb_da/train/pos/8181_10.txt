Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a large house with a pool. Besides discovering that his wife goes out with the pool attendant, he discovers that behind everything is clean, there is decay. He starts torturing his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the fake dentist. He is completely trustworthy. There are surprisingly little things to do, but the scenes in dental torture are quite unpleasant and grotesque. It is highly recommended. The "dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
