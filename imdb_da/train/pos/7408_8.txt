I had the privilege of watching this movie at the Intenational Film Festival in Rotterdam. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low-budget movie about a father and his 2 sons. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where locals, mostly aged men, come to relax and bathe. The father has sons: a 'delayed' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a large modern city who comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother look strange and annoying, but it changes in the movie. Although the story may sound cheesy or clich√©, it is not. With really good performances, especially the father and the 'delayed' son (sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story, which the film touched and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you got a chance to watch this movie do it. It's a great alternative to the regular Hollywood movie theater. <br /> <br />
