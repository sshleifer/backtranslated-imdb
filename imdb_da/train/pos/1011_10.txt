I love Jack's jokes like 'The Cliché is ...' or 'Over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, a little creepy ...'. He's just fun! Daniel starts catching up with him! Good thing Jack is no longer on the team (in a way) otherwise it would have been sarcastic mania !!!! I just love all the plotters (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are good, the actors are good, I start collecting facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's just all theoretical possible and exciting ... oops! Your I go again !!! Sorry, I am also starting to retrieve Carter moves, and all this drives my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons, especially if they continue to pack the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !
