This movie came 12 years ago and was a revelation even to people who knew something of the New York dragon scene. The handbooks on traction performance say nothing about these vogueing houses. Anthony Slides 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide" with its flowing chart of influence that draws together Julian Eltinge, Minette, the Warhol queens and the 90s club scene - and subsequently the movie - completely ignores the houses. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we've got to a final book on traction performance, is rushing past the movie and does not provide the background information that one would have expected of it. <br /> <br /> I understand from the movie itself and various articles I found on the web that this house system goes back decades. The big movie performance of a house member before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the largest missing part of "Paris Burning". <br /> <br /> The movie is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during the film gives a very dramatic ending, but it is not the only movie about transsexuals to involve a real murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified body in his literal closet, but it didn't come out until three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical significance, but we still need someone to make a book or documentary that provides more consistency.
