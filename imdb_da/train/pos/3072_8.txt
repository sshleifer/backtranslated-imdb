Panic is a sneaky little gem of a movie - you think you've only figured out the first half hour to only realize that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / instructor than that. <br /> <br /> The movie slowly builds, with a quietly devastating scene after another, all done perfectly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most notable children's actor I 'Long Time has David Dorfman, like Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they are completely unscripted thoughts created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
