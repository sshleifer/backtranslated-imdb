Something ugly business with Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (yes, a Renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol.) Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides ( Why do they? Who knows?) so his wife can continue to look beautiful. He makes the brides after making a beautifully tricky trick with some orchids bringing the brides together at the altar. After another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter Just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop and decide to snoop around for a story. She gets every possible trace of the orchids and Lugosi. The sky knows where the police were. Soon she's gone to Belas lair when she meets a kind of strange looking doctor which may or may not be eeeevil, it cumulates in a completely removed plan to get a false wedding to catch the mad scientist, but it seems that the researcher has x-ray vision as he follows his plans, oh no! It happens ? I actually liked this movie is a bit guilty. Lugosi is amazing here, his hangers are all very very strange, the story is actually pretty creepy in some places that make it most visible. A fun little view.
