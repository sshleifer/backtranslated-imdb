At first glance Who's Singing Over There just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy ?? with only some kind of unusual, quiet and slow motion: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers on a desert landscape, a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors store it a gem! <br /> <br /> The folded story and a fake rhythm induce you to think, yes it is cartoon, but let's just guess it will be a kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny with instant, dark subtle cynical on others, its evolution surprises you the whole story ?? Very ingenious and cleverly presented, all characters are important, and the actors give them full life. <br /> <br /> It is amazing, it is based on deep observation, great mastering of camera work, and of great importance, and really everything, the general direction, and how the details are presented, it just makes you forget it is a movie: It's like seeing a friendly human society that you don't know yet, shot by a friend behind a camera. <br /> <br /> And you're the one behind him. It's simple and simply unusual! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; by no means that would mean the manuscript, the image quality, the music score has some kind of amateurish way, no no! It's amazing art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river ?? From high up in the mountain, down to the sea, with all the different kinds of grounds and pines, which a true river will encounter on its journey to the sea ?? from a small thing to a mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I used is the very best way I can find out to explain all the charms of who's singing over there. For me I take the hammer again: Simply unique ... I have seen that the director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is quietly famous ?? But as I did not yet see it, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dithyrambic comments on that movie, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema I do not know well because it is rarely translated, but I have the good fortune to have this copy one in original language with good English subtitles. All in all: Deep, delicious and unusual ... For fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffers, avoid it at all costs, it can be too subtle and good for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, you do not assume that you will not regret it and if you buy it, it will have a good time in your personal DVD library , with no less than deserved big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite instructors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A movie is never really good unless the camera is an eye in a poet's head Orson Welles ***
