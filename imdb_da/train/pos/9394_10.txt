"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best excitement players in the 90s with an excellent script (by John and Rick Dahl) who kept you guessing all the time and on the edge of your seat most of the movie . It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and included a fantastic cast, including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially JT Walsh (in a memorable performance), making this an easier and captivating thriller that must not be missed . The movie never had much publicity when publishing (actually I first brought it on TV) and is therefore one of the special little jewels that you have to find out, but this unique movie is now slowly getting a sense of culture. <Br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is crushed and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Lost for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas, he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to murder wife proprietor Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides to go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double connections - that Cage is thrown from a crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation, he cannot withdraw! So, to complicate matters even further, the true Lyle gets ready to perform the contract killings (played by everyone's favorite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened, he goes after Cage, but no one can see the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite lines from the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman getting hurt, but it's a horrible lot of money". <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you have to spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of this". <br /> <br /> Boyle (to cage): "You're not a killer?". Cage: "That's right, no. But the guy I just need to get into town so you have to get out of here." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to cage): "OK, how are you going to explain publishing an employee killer and taking $ 10,000 from my husband?". An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never lets up and powerfully work by all instructors. Any movie with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor career was tragically cut short by a heart attack in 1998. The most productive period for "film noir" was undoubtedly forty, but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my "Top Ten" list of all time favorite movies. I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
