Under Eddie Murphy's stand there is a woman from the audience at Eddie, and a man from the audience responds. What is being said, women - DO MR ROB (this is a sign from Saturday Night live), the man reacts with SHUT UP BITCH. Unlike the previous post, the women shouted rubber boots, this is wrong, even though the poster said he was there, they must have a hearing problem! despite what the post is saying about not being able to here it on dvd has a close listen as you can actually hear it on dvd - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope it helps anyone curious about the outbreak bowl, gaz !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
