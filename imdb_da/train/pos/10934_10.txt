Having reviewed this intense martial arts for the first time in almost 18 years, I have to say that it did not lose any of its mystery or any of its glittering martial arts actions that I had remembered from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor sends his "unfinished" student out to find the 5 former members of his poison clan so they are not seeking a fortune that the master's friend conceals. Fearing that his last student did not have enough training, he instructed him to make friends with one of the five "venom" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough about choreography or camera work. A nice movie in itself and certainly one of the best martial arts films ever made. A CLASSIC!!
