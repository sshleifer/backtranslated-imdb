When you look at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to watch the movie under its short-lived theater performance. The audience laughed off their heads. I see a tape of it when I write, and it's still dang fun! <br /> <br /> It also has a cute side, with unexpected turns of true pathos. The late, big Royal Dano is particularly effective as the lonely, down-on-its-lucky farmers Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is great as the leading kids. And the actors in the Martians suits, though limited to mime, do a good job. Another thing to look for is the background information. The movie is full of homages, pastiches and references to other SF and fantasy movies. Take a look at the martial costumes next time. One of them has a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a House Atreide's uniform, and a fourth has a Last Starfighter escape.
