The first of the Tarzan films stared Johnny Weissmuller. The reason is already summed up, so I will not go into it again. Just know that the actors playing Jane and Tarzan were born to the role. If you haven't seen this movie and you only have modern Tarzan movies as a reference .. you lack a real treat. No matter how far we've come in film making, makeup sets design ... no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did. He was and is Tarzan.
