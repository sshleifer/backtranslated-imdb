Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a football in a football entrepreneur who acquires the passport of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of Benfica (the club of the heart), FC Porto, so these are players did not play well, and it wanted FC Port to be wronged with this. But what happens is that these two players are good at all, and FC Porto sells them too much money to a foreign club doing good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without big antecedents in big movies, is a very good and fun comedy that shows all the rivalry that exists between North / South Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
