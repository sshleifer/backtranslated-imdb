I watched this movie when I was about 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I have never forgotten this movie! I was deeply moved and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just couldn't believe it when he became an eagle when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her for Recently, if she remembered the movie, we saw the boy and the eagle, and she said she remembered it as if we only saw it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST SEE !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - like my sister and me ...
