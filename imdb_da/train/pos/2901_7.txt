Tiempo de Valientes fits well into the compact film genre, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, huge report between its driver and excellent photography. Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein, a shrunk assigned riding with detective Diaz (Luis Luque), has been tasked with investigating the murder of two smaller caps that appear to have been involved in ammunition mergers. Diaz has been suspended from service, but he is the best man for the job and needs professional psychiatric help to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz will soon enter into a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial time, enabling Silverstein to develop some impressive abilities. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of the screenplay Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as classically beautiful as Hill. It is noteworthy that Tiempo de Valientes, although almost two hours long, does not welcome it, and also director-director Damian Szifron puts a potential successor in the film's charming coda. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither pans to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence.
