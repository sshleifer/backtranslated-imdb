This is an excellent movie with a star play and some great plays. I never tolerate seeing it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character, Simon and Mack, have brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his mannerisms are effortless and one you would often encounter. So it's a very 'real' movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at the start of the movie, when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down. The film also has a strong message and is in contrast to the stereotypical message that carries movies where there is a person who preaches his gut to an audience. Instead, the actors' emotions and situations give an emotional message that does it best without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
