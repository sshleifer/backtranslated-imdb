This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish television company decided to broadcast it again for a couple of summers since I just finished my first semester at the high school. I was surprised to see the depth at which the organs were explained. Sure, some things are simplified, but most were correct (though it was made 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that all soon-to-do students should see it. It is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words. Now I am in my seventh semester, and I think I see the series again as soon as I have bought the DVD box :-)
