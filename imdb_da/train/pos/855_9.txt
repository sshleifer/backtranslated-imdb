This movie is amazing. Finally, well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is flat out hysterical in this self-destructive role. I think it's the best he has ever done. He has done other roles that exhibited shades of being able to do this kind of full-time work, but this role finally gave him room to run with it. I almost died when he walked over the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple to strive for as well as actors to strive for. Kinnear is so greasy that his trip is really gratifying. You give good actors a good job of playing with, and they give us something more back.
