Although this movie is somewhat sanitized (because it was made at a time when people didn't just talk about sex), it is an extremely helpful short film showing prepubious girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid by the Kotex company, although what may surprise many is that Disney made this movie - when they made many educational films in the 1940s and 60s. But well made the movie is, although I think the filmmaker has missed a real opportunity. Instead of the pleasant female narrator's voice and the relatively gentle visuals, it would have been good if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney band !! I know this would have given Old Walt a heart attack, but wow it would have been a good movie! By the way, although the concept of sex is hardly indicated in the film, it explains enough menstruation in general. But it lacks some details (especially about intercourse) which I assume were included in the accompanying brochure. <br /> <br /> Now if I can only figure out why I saw a cartoon about menstruation.
