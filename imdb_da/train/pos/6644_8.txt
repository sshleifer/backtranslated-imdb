After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' recorded 1979 book "The House Next Door" has finally been filmed. The result comes a little from the novel, which is especially understandable in the first story of the trilogy if it is not satisfactory, as it is a television movie that is all absorbent and actually very good, just not as big as the book, one by Stephen The king's favorites and one of mine too. <br /> <br /> With more running time and fewer restrictions as a theatrical release, all the wealth inherent in the original three-part history of the vicious ultra-modern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climatic revelation near the end. <br /> <br /> Yet, the whole thing threw itself well into this thought-provoking story of mindless evil. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next door amateur artist neighbor trying to visualize his corruption on canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read the great novel.
