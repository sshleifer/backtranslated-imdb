This is the best movie I've come across for a long time. Not only is this the best movie of its kind (school recording) The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to film was great. He filmed it using teenage actors who still attended high school. He filmed it in the actors 'own room and used the actors' real parents as their parents in the movie. Also, the actors also used video cameras that make it much more like a video diary. It's almost artificial. (If it really is a word) There are a few slip ups, for example when Cal calls brads (?) Land rover a range rover (or vice versa, it has been a while since I have seen it)
