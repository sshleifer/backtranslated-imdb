Not one of your harder frames, and it's a real strength in this movie. There are at least two conditions where less confident authors would have added too predictable romantic excitement. They not only save the audience here, but at the same time throw some surprises. There are a few Disney-ish moments, especially near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rent and it was good, relaxed fun. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you get the DVD, see the segment where the instructor teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we will do it the day before we plan to eat it because it is a bowl that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices come out!
