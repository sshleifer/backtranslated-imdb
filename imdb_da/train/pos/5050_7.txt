We really enjoyed Gray Owl: A simple story told well in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romanticized, with archetypes, humor and stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and told on a lovely pace is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who became native to Indian, and went to live and fall in Canada. <br /> <br /> Solid performances from everyone make this movie with a lightweight display. <br /> <br /> Two of the movie's stars are undoubtedly the cutest we've ever seen - and the message is good with its eco-launches. It must have been great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character, and this is a suitable movie tribute.
