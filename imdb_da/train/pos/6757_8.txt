Dana Andrews says "Where the Stairway Ends" in this 1950's film, which also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a policeman with a bad mood who has been struggling with the past to beat suspects. When a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scalise blames Ken Paine's assassination (Stevens), who has now left the club after struggling not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but the victim. Dixon believes the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result of mobster men. He goes to see Paine and does not understand that he has a record in the head of the war, knocks him on the floor and accidentally kills him. Now he must cover the murder. As a further complication, he falls to Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paina's apartment after he saw that Paine had hit her daughter, was arrested for the crime. This is a really great, gritty noir with some good performances. The robust, beautiful and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who must remain one step ahead of his colleagues. The movie is reunited with its amazing "Laura" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks lovely like a model with bad taste in men who are apparently used to being incubated. She knows a little, she has another on her hands. Ken Tully does a great job as her father, protesting on his innocence despite some amazing evidence. Karl Malden is very hard as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-run, fast and absorbent film is the end. Pure Hollywood and putting myself in Tierney's place, I doubt I would react the same way. A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I didn't find it as awe-inspiring as "Laura", but few things in this world are. If you like movies noir, this is a must-see.
