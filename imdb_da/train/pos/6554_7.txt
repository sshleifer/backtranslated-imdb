OK heres what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I'm a big Nancy fan, and I've read all 1-56 original books, and I continued to read more. I'm now at 96. Beware of villains who give this movie a lower class than it should have. All tracks show a wonderful movie! I loved it all. So what Nancy is in the present time. She is still old fashioned as she is in the books! People who haven't read more than 5 books complain about Nancy. I've read them all, and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the movie spooky. I loved the exciting car tickets and getting aways. I loved the tracks. I solved the mystery myself! It was truly wonderful. I suggest you see it when people who complained don't know what a good movie is and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. It can't be worthy of Oscar, but it's really a good movie.
