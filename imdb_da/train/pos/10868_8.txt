I always thought that this would be a long and boring Talking Heads flick full of static interiors, guy, I was wrong. "Election" is a very fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama that takes a deep and realistic view of the origins of Triads-Rituals. Signs are constantly on the move, and even if you as a viewer always remain an outsider, it is still possible to feel the tension coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie succeeds in creating some truly sumptuous images due to meticulous lighting and atmospheric shade contrast. Although there is no action, the end is still shocking in the ruthless depiction of brutality. Cool movies that deserve more attention and I liked the minimalist acoustic guitar score quite a bit.
