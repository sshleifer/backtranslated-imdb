(WARNING: smaller spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran into this one partially and then from there, didn't know what it was or what the plot was. It was definitely my attention; I didn't know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to do the dirty job came out as a serious good guy who just got her head angry with a rude girl; I have to question how true life is that the portrayal is. Anyone who would murder a man and wife when they slept, just can't be quite nice. Still, I had some sympathy for him when he was created and exploited; It was very clear. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is at the end (here's the biggest spoiler! skip this section if you don't want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered. The way it was discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how was the police convinced to follow it? The film did not show us, and it seemed a little too practical to explain how they were persuaded to do so. I think the way they handled was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the legend lent an aura of excitement to the decisive scene that would not otherwise have been there (we would already have known what The scene was about and what happened to Brad in it. <br /> Otherwise, this is a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested in finding out the facts. <br /> <br /> Another thing: The movie was made in 1996. Some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a recent movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is lovely. I hadn't seen her before. She can also act a little (always a plus in her working life, LOL).
