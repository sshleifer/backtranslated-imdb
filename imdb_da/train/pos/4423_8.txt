GOJOE takes a little getting used to at first, but the final result is very satisfactory. The story of a murderous samurai, seeking to solve itself by opposing a widespread but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is much at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The movie may appear to be similar to another anime-inspired samurai movie at first, but it gradually goes deep into more mature / adult areas soon after. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out. GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies coming after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review of movies and reviews of other foreign films)
