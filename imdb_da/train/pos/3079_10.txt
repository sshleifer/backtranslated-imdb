While listening to an audiobook, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear his voice, and it left my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep the good shows on air enough to catch an audience that can connect with the show story. What a shame and shame on the network so as not to give this show a full season opportunity. This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast. The network gave "men in trees" another chance witch is also a good show, but they took "invasion" away and it was also quite different from seeing, not the same old old themes. Why can't the network get it right?
