A good movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and horrible, totally surreal (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style perhaps with mixed with a little Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a little bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... Add one night to the earth, Angel Heart and a little bit Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacobs Stige, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for avant-garde and / or surrealistic movies (as I am) you would like this one. If you expect something else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else. Final words: The reason is very, very strange and unusual, and that's probably the # 1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this movie hate it.
