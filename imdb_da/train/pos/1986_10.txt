A trip deforce! OK the baby playing Oliver is a little toooooo sweet! Starting with the great movie, color, costumes and most impressive performances, this is a must see movie. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above them all and it is a musical start! It's a masterful Fagan who never leaves his character to make a song. You never really know if you like him or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions, you hate him from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... When you read the book, you're a medieval, and then he's in this movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife instructed this masterpiece. I went and saw his last movie, Gladiator based on his many fine performances, not to see headliners. The music suits the times and the mood. Who wants to buy this beautiful movie? You ought to!
