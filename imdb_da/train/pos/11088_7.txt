The villian in this movie is a strange sneak and he seems to enjoy what he does, that's what I think makes him so strange. I don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. This is one of the films that pretty much remains a medium to the very end. But then you have it, a candy bar ends that makes me look back and say "HOKIE AS HELL." A really good movie to the end. Conclusion is the end we would like to see, but not the end of such an average beginning. And then there is the aftermath of what happened. Guess you can make your own mind about the true ending. I have the feeling that only one sign should have survived in the end.
