I downloaded this in the "Danger After Dark" box and saw it exclusively because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a corny horror movie that was a great gore party and with very poor dialogue. That's exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead, I found myself fascinated by the good development of the characters, and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The two star actors' abilities were surprisingly good as they were not professional actors, and the director did a fantastic job with it all and put it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie I've seen him is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this movie he seems to be the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, bubbly and hyper that serves as a kind of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking about it. So beware of his performance if you are familiar with Battle Royale, you will be very surprised at him. <br /> <br /> But don't waste the summary on the back of the box because this is not a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. That Hyde character is a vampire is almost a background factor with what really happens in the foreground, and you will love the last scene. It is a real moving image on some points, the photography is really well done. It is definitely something to be downloaded the next time you are at Blockbuster.
