Wow. A truly amazing 'tour' movie that has tons of super-surreal images, dark intent and a black, rather strange sense of how cartoon animals should see the world. It is populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and float with stunted backgrounds. As with all the beautiful imaginations, the wandering plot is secondary to the eyebrowing images, and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swords and pigs fishing. I had never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of American cartoonist's surrealistic pencil work; Bill Plympton. It's a demented delight for fans of odd, beautiful things, and it had glue me to the screen for fear that I would miss something amazing. In short, it's 'Hello Kitty' without 'o'.
