Dog Day is one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very hard and cruel at some points and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, desperation, deep emotional dead ends, problematic issues, perversion, complexes, madness. All the things that are present in the big advanced cities today. It once again makes you aware of the passionate state in which people have leading societies. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city was never pictured on the screen so properly. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. That's why ... 10/10.
