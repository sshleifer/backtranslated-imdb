I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's an excellent fanfiction movie series and I can't wait to see more. I just started watching this movie series last week and I just can't get enough of it. I have already recommended it to other people to see as it is well worth the view. I've already seen each episode many times and waiting to see more episodes coming out. I rated it a ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff on an excellent job. If you like Star Trek I highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction movie. The details associated with this series of films are excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it
