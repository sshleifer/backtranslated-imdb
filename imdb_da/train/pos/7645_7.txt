Belushi at his most intrusive and Courtney Cox before friends have a small role. I often think Belushi is underutilized in Hollywood and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and sympathetic character. The movie itself is not earthquake, and the message is not new either, but it is sweet and loving. The supportive caste of familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's sling may be tiring, and Michael Caines charming spiritual guide has a slightly creepy if not well-meaning edge. Hamilton, as Belushi's wife, is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not terribly convincing on "prom queen" who came away. Nevertheless, a good way to spend two hours.
