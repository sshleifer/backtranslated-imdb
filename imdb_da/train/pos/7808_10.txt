This is a movie that everyone should see. Aside from raising enormously important points (while South Africa is heading for recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is excellent, while Denzel Washington, in my opinion, offers the best performance in his career so far. Kline also gives a good performance, but perhaps not as amazing as Washington. John Thaw also makes a good trip as a police officer. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall, but all of them have been avoided. It would be easy to simply depict white people as the evil and black people as the good ones, but Attenborough has not done this. Sure, there were some white characters that seemed inherently evil, like the captain of Soweto rebellion, but to add extra dimensions to all the characters, the movie would be unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it is truly incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is for Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd starts singing the South African folk song, it's probably one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie already: see it. It may not be pleasant to see, but it is definitely worth it.
