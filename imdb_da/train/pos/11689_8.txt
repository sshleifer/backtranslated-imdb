Hopefully the score has changed at this time because of my brilliant and amazing review that persuades all of you to go watch the movie and thereby create an instant chorus of "8" s, this movie's true score. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Earlier to see this movie I was not the top of him, but now I hit the doors on Chris Rock's website and ask him to take me as his protege. This movie is really fun, if you don't find this movie fun, you really need therapy, and it's humor that targets every community, including race (predictable), class sharing, love, wealth, employment, dreams, booth up comedy ... The list goes on. <br /> <br /> There was, however, a little disappointment to me. It was that by entering this movie I didn't realize that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another pretty good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot started to rave out to be clearly resembling an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago. Whether this movie is in my opinion the better version out of two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty anyone else of any day in one week any year of anyone ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Go to the movie's current plot. <br /> <br /> Don't pamper the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just go see a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far, there are ravens sour on it, watch it because it's the funniest thing you would have seen for a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience it does not leave you grumbling at nauseum at the expense of cinema tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
