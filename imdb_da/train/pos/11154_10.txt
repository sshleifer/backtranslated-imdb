It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made in America, and it deserved every prize it won and it is a place on the AFI Top 100 list (although it is shamefully low on the IMDB Top 250- list, only on # 183 as of this writing). If you enjoy performing the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are a great match), great characterizations and inventive directions, editing and filmography, you will love this as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vivid and always credible picture of the New York City scene at the end of the 60s, and many victims are struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst amorality, poverty, and hopelessness in 42th Street, New York City. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking techniques used here capture the brilliance of the underground New York movie movement (and of the city) and are nothing short of dazzling. I've seen many ideas (including quick-fire editing, handling voice-over flashbacks, fabric / trip sequences and the cartoon-like face slipping under a murder scene to convey anxiety and terror) stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way that they are seen as an unusually strong friendship or to have the gay base. I think the director handled this in a subtle way, not to go out on the censorship of times, but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> <MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving movie of size, influence and meaning that has lost absolutely none of its impact over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you really miss a true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Result: 10 out of 10.
