"There Todsking" is not exactly the type of movie that makes you happy ?? Jörg Buttgereits second cult monument in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", consists of seven short episodes ?? one for every day of the week ?? is about independent people's suicide. Between these already very disruptive episodes, Buttgereit deploys truly awful images of a highly destructive male body. The sections are not all equally powerful, but as a healthy "Der Todsking" is ranked quite high on the list of most depressing art house films. In particular, the episodes on Wednesday involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and one of Sunday focusing on a younger man painting himself to death is extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this movie or any other chokumean as it is debatable and I am not even sure if Buttgereit had any kind of message to communicate here. There is the vague mention of a spooky chain letter calling on its readers to commit suicide, but for the most part, we remain uninformed about the motivation of these people to end their lives so dramatically. Quite unlike I expected, "There Todsking" is not exploitative or repulsive graphic! On the contrary, I could never have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thought-provoking about the depiction of pure human misery. Thursday's match is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different views of a famous German bridge, while names, ages and professions of people jumping out appear on the screen. The production values ​​are inevitably poor, and editing often lacks professionalism, but that is not what really counts in this type of cinema. The subject is strong and forces us to think of the less cheerful ?? but also indispensable ?? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music!
