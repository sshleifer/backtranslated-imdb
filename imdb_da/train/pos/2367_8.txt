I couldn't take my eyes off this movie when it came to cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality that is most associated with soft core porn. In this case, the appropriate plot serves as a vehicle that is not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Indian TV, anyway.) <br /> <br /> Not being the fan of the genre, I couldn't place Jeff Wincott and had no leaders to search from. First, when Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayor!) For the highest dish we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II, I got the positive ID on her. <br /> <br /> This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of the early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock Ã  la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag to "so-bad-it's-good"?
