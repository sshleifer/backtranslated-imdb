I took my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained. Firstly, it was clean and I mean by my standards. The majority of children's films today are filled with raw toilet humor and grossly jokes to induce cheap laughter from the pre-teen crowd. Nancy Drew is wiser than that, and humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by Emma Roberts, who is perky and polite without being annoying. Unlike Brady Bunch movies, where the anachronistic characters are blasted and ridiculous, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a good moment when the LA "style-conscious" girls with their Paris Hilton streetwalker attire are rejected by the boutique owner, while Nancy in her penny loafers and homemade Butterick pattern dress is embraced. This movie portrays the we-need-to-enlighten-this-wholesome-girl thanks as many Hollywood movies take. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​throughout. <br /> <br /> The mystery is just thrilled at times to be engaging. There were several exciting moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no free chokes scenes. It's all based on excitement and mood and is very fun. The support molding is good, especially Marshall Bell as the creepy caretaker. There are some amazing cameos by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better ratings than some have given it. Not only was I happy not to be drawn to yet another computer animated movie, where talking animals burp and pass gas everywhere, but I was also very entertained. Had I been there without a child, I would still have had the movie. This is a DVD that will get my daughter's name on it under the Christmas tree.
