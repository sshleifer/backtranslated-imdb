Sometimes I see a movie and am really impressed by it ?? And it's still not easy to explain why I liked it so much. This applies mainly to the unusual movies ?? you can hardly compare them with the rest out there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special films. There are many emotions in that movie ?? and the play was so good that while I watched the movie, I cried and laughed when the story continued. The young Nick Robinson ?? is a young boy (William) evacuated from London because of the air striking there during World War II. Mr. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man leaving in the village where the evacuated children were sent. <br /> <br /> Initially, Tom refuses to take any responsibility - like taking care of a worried young guy? but accepting since he is left without choice. During the stay, Tom discovers how terrible life has been for William ?? Alongside his luggage, his mother sent a belt and wrote instructions to her son's host? Don't hesitate to use it. This belt is berried in the field ?? never be used in such a brutal way. Mr. Tom gives a real home to William, and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, creates new friends, and discovers hidden talents. All of a sudden, a letter called William is home to London with a letter saying she is not well and it starts all over again? only this time will it be much worse ?? There are many emotions you can feel in this movie ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Goodnight Tom is another masterpiece of the British cinema that can only be compared to others like dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? to compare. I really enjoyed seeing it and highly recommend it. Before I finish this review I would also like to mention Thomas Orange's great achievement in the role of Zac ?? reminded me of a my friend from my own childhood (:
