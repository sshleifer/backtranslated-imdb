Things about my people are a wonderful movie about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also the son with his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser has written a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is fun, exciting and thoughtful. It led me to reassess my own relationship with both my late father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been better cast. I hope both Mr. Falk and Mr. Travel is recognized in next year's film prizes for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Traveling for his script.
