I rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim. I like Alan Arkin and the lid was catching ... I read my back and knew immediately that it would be the best or the worst movie I've ever seen ... I think I was lucky .. I laughed beginning to end. Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. I have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time. But it doesn't take away from the movie. the disk was the author of Blockbuster exculsivley, so they did not allow you to skip the previews. Apart from that, you should not leave the features of DVD in order to deter you from seeing the excellent movie.
