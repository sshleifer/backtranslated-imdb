Just like this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she believed in the Havana sequences where Simmons and Brando danced up a storm was excellent. It was also impressive for me and was usually the highlights of the movie. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that arose as a story of Damon Runyon, takes a while with the slow pacing of the non-musical scenes at first, but pulls you in for a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing to me but still had their charm especially under the "Sue Me" number. Also loved Stubby Kayes "Sit Down, You Rocking the Boat" number and performances by Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look everywhere, Guys and Dolls are not a great movie music, but certainly a very good one.
