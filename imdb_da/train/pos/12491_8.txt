This movie was very good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The action was very good, although I thought the actor who played Julie might have had more feelings behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was great. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends were screaming and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen. I give it two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you haven't already seen it, then rent it. If you've seen it and didn't like it, go see it again because there are parts that were totally unreal. I also liked how much of the movie was filmed around and on my school's campus.
