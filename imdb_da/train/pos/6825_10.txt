I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavete's Opening Night. It's the first movie of his that I've seen that seems to be on a larger scale, so it feels more common, but it still doesn't feel like he was basing himself more than he has in his previous films. Maybe that's what makes it so intense. There is also no doubt cathartically about watching this movie. It's about what Cassavetes has actually made his own career, an ideal he has expressed behind the camera through his career as an instructor and is here expressing it in front. Rowland's character, middle-aged stage actor Myrtle Gordon, cannot play her role in the forthcoming production as written, so she unwittingly follows impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage until she finds it right. It is a bold abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that fails to capture the innate control that goes through during emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does and it is seen and even portrayed as something devastating, but it may just be the best thing for her. It can be a cleansing rather than a breakdown. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, culminates in a breakdown. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally genuine touch, which is so early that she strongly argues that she has nothing in common with her character, but she is at rest but emotionally corrosive fears that the opposite is true . <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climatic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully excused by her acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hitting, enlightening and enjoyable moments I have ever seen in a movie.
