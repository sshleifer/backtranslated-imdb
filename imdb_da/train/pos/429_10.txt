It has been about 50 years since a film about romance and mystery has been made. The only two films I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used wonderful actors not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. "Enchanted April" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. It's amazing "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It stands out as an enjoyable classic.
