This is an Oriental fantasy about a thousand and an Arabian evening - lots of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. The vicious visor Jaffar (heavily played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magic faculties captures Prince Ahamad Baghdad (attractive John Justin) who loses his throne, then escapes a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They arrive at Basora, where Ahamad and the princess (beautiful June Duprez) fall in love. But Prince and Thief are haunted by Jaffar, Ahamd is blind and Abu has become a dog. The story accumulates several amazing ingredients such as the transformation of the lead role, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying blanket and of course the colossal genius (assault by Rex Ingram) that gives three wishes to Sabu, the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with multiple hands , among other. <br /> <br /> This remarkable image ranks as one of the finest amazing movies all the time. Produced by London Fims Alexander Korda and directed by the finally credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning script by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, dialogue writer and actor such as Sultan are also fond of mechanical games. The outbreak of World War II caused paralyzing shooting, and the three brothers from Korda and partners traveled the United States and continued there with the film in particular at Grand Cannon Colorado. The amazing visual and brilliant Technicolor movie, setting and FX provoked three Oscars: Production Design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, Cinematography by George Perinal and Special Effects of Osmond Borradaile is dated today and is urgently needed remastering because the colors is worn out. Furthermore, a nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score of Miklos Rozsa. This lively tale of huge doses of fantasy would like to be fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs
