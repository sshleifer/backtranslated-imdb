Sea Watching is made from an original Akira Kurosawa script and is actually a lush and warm movie. Seeing it will be a pleasure! Kei Kumai as an instructor is certainly not equal to the old but eternal master (especially the mass scenes at the beginning of the movie have some terrible actions), but the general mood and scenery are very pleasant. Another thing missing here: Kurosawa has always managed to let the characters be so much more than what they actually show and do. It was probably his magic on the set while shooting; And just maybe this script wasn't quite up to par yet. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a nice and sweet movie, but it's no Kurosawa. To expect it could be very silly ...
