It's not the same as the other movies about dance. A few normal people found themselves dancing. Unlike the dancing movies in Hollywood, the characters in this movie are not beautiful or hot young people. They are someone you might see every day in your offices. They are a little depressed over their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams of dancing. This touches me very deeply.
