This is another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-paced director has something unusual for his previous films - a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley are in this film about a group of communist agents trying to sneak secrets out of America - and they stop nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Peters on a metro car monitored by federal agents. They know she's a link in a long spy chain. Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation - a small-time pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train, and he manages to steal the secrets that Peter's bear. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen. Now it is Widmark alone - with Commies and the FBI on its track. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are extraordinary, and the movie captures from start to finish. Although she did not receive top billing, Thelma Ritter should be mentioned specifically. This entertaining actress might have performed her lifetime as a stool pigeon. She rarely got so much chance to act, and I was impressed with her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and director go, they are very good- but with a small exception. First, I loved how Widmark and Peter interacted. It's one of the few times on film you see a woman stopping square in her mouth! Now it's difficult. Later inexplicably, they become amazingly close - too close to being credible. Nevertheless, with such a huge drama and such an effective Noir-like movie, this can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
