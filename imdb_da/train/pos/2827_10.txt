This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! It is probably best if you don't see it expecting a gripping plot and something amazingly smart and entertaining because you will be disappointed. But if you want to see it then you can see 50 million vases and Goro's amazing hair / bad English you are in for a real treat. The harder you think of the movie, the worse it will be unless you have a competition to spot the most plump holes / screws in which case you have hours of entertainment in advance. I really only recommend this movie to the bored or die-hard-smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a little cautious because Goro's Japanese fans were a little ahead of what they thought he was selling himself. (He wasn't real, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do it for him).
