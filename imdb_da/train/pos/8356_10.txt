Not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so beware: <br /> <br /> Just a small but crucial thing to look for, an exciting option: the boys steal a green Citroen at a time of joy and returning it to the owner who has made purposeful and averse hidden damage to the car, hoping the owner will collide. Is it the same car they steal much later from the picnic family? We know that the original owner sold it. They run at the end of a dangerous road, which I understand is closed to anyone but pedestrians over the last ten years. A brand new slope to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In another case, this movie could have been called "the scent of a woman". I can't remember another movie, certainly not American, that treats the scent of a woman in such an open and open manner, like the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.
