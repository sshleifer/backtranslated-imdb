Of life in (some) colleges. Of course, there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this movie continues in some colleges. I went to colleges in Southern California, where races are largely related to their own. It's fun because it's schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. And I can honestly say it's there. But it is when the class escapes, or when they just hang out and wait for the class, they (the students) just seem to be connected with people in their own race or ethnicity. Is it bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But just like the school paper in one of the schools I attended, I once wrote about it: "We all have to try to connect with students of other ethnic groups and try to know them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of the schools I participated in. Once, you put brochures around campus and talked about the glory stories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie, where the young Caucasian man went out and started shooting at a multicultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this will ever happen. <Br /> <br /> So is "Higher Learning" too dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe. Is that way "off mark?" It depends on where you went to or go to school. The race thing where ethnicities are just related to their own happens. Minus the Hollywood exaggerations, the race case hit pretty close to home for me.
