I think the film is educational. However, it fails to deal with the problem of so much controversy: majority marriage. Also, the film fails to reveal what LDS church espouses. Great opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually think. I couldn't get a clear idea of ​​how LDS views central issues of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. Would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they see their prophet's more controversial statements. Perhaps these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's truly interesting life. After all, it gives insight into American belief in 18th century religion. Hope they make some documentaries on this fascinating topic so historians can comment on Smith's life. We can have a Mormon President one day. Smith ran after president, after all.
