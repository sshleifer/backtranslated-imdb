"The Matador" stars Pierce Brosnan as a burnt out assassin. He's James Bond's seed, in too dense, garish clothes, gold chains and a nasty haircut. Our giant murder, Julian Noble, is in Mexico and tries to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a sympathetic, down-on-luck businessman, Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), and is also trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his Denver wife (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright become unexpected friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques he demonstrates in bullfighting. Noble is ultimately targeted by his employers and appears in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard made Q&A following this great movie at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also down on his luck. Having suffered the loss of his agent and rejection of newer scripts, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then Pierce called Brosnan. Brosnan regains its balance in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-directed comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stick to the final credits to read what the filmmakers are saying about bullfighting. I'm looking forward to several of Richard Shepard's projects.
