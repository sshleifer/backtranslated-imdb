I do not expect the highest caliber of film production by Joel Schumacher who controls this, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. In technology, it is often derived from the SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with the shaky camera work, grainy shoots, the film occasionally running as if it skips a sprocket --- all these techniques Speilberg used to make his film more realistic, but ultimately was more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> However, unlike the SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not as weak as the characters in this movie seemed more like real people, and the story was less constructed, not so wrapped in the American flag (Speilberg sheep a 'F' in subtlety). <br /> <br /> Besides the first part of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic depiction of bootcamp I've seen in a movie, and for that I think it's worth seeing . <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
