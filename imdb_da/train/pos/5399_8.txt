Gosha's last big movie from the 1960s. A determined stylist with a great sense of film, Gosha joined forces with Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi fame) to produce this grim accusation of mindless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists of the emperor shout while killing enemies or "traitors" for the cause. Katsu plays his character 'simple minded fidelity to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone questioning the politician is labeled a "traitor" and becomes a murder target. <br /> <br /> One of the best photographed movies ever, many shots are incredible compositions of shape, color and light. The fighting scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the color palette Gosha uses for his pictures. Beautiful and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated, and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very useful, you can fight through the film without it. The few drawbacks of the movie are the music track, the length and Katsu's occasional scenery. He has a drunk scene that is over the top for a movie, but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat, but one of the great chambara movies.
