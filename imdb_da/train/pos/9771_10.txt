Convincing and innovative! At the beginning of this criminally underrated Whoopi Goldberg flap, the authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane" from 1941. The authors are entitled to draw such a seemingly different parallel, but the audience is too often stuck to See too hyped Hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, like Whoopi Goldberg in this movie. This film is about finding love in everybody's differences. It is an epic study of fear of surrender and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Those who paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for the time, with the only reasoned comparisons such as Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would love to see an uplifting, celluloid philosophical study of some of man's deepest drives; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be seen immediately!
