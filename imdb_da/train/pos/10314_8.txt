This and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, something is missing in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize too much the lesson to be learned. It's a little more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. But this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that whatever they do, the lovers can never unite. I remember not being surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later recreated in "The Lake House". I think this is because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later movie .
