Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one and then finds it too little. Good caste and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical, and O'Connor's voice sounds like Mini Mouse! She disappeared from sight shortly after making this movie - so life can imitate art! One must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star born though.
