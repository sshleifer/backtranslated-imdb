It is a shame that the release is primarily known as the Redneck rape film and Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie cannot get their meaning out of the rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in almost any movie. People tend to miss the power of the movie that contains the infamous buggery scene. <br /> <br /> The act, plot, filmography and soundtrack in the Release all give a hand to it is brooding charisma. The backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and contrasts completely with the dark subject. The actors, both big and small, make you feel like you are rafting down that river with them. <br /> <br /> What sets this film apart from others is the concrete sense of fear it inspires. Not many movies can make you feel scary. Bottom line: This movie is a classic. I can't really say much more than that.
