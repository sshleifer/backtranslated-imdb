Why can't this type of compact, entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. Cast is a good ensemble. William Powell shows true star quality. Who knows - maybe he reacted to his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to see. One can also see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He is a great supportive character actor and his outstanding chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor works above average in a not very meaty role. All other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. I suppose Michael Curtiz had a ball that instructed him. Bravo!
