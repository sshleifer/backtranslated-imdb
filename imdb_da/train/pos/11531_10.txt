I remember being a child when I first watched this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some parts of it). I can't remember much about acting, naked scenes or other things, but I remember a man having his head blown up with a grenade, a man dismembered over a tree and a man running down a truck and shooting his head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped off the killer's stomach to get the truck key. It's a movie that gives you creeps and it's worth seeing. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
