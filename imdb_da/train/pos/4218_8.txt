I haven't really seen too many of the Columbo movies ... actually I think I've only seen one or two except this one. I always wanted Columbo, but somehow without seeing so much of him. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character because of his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that even though the series started back in 1968, the latest (and probably not the last) of the films was made in 2003. It's 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my count is off), all made for TV. Everyone knows the character, though no one has ever seen a movie with him in the cinema. It is quite a fulfillment if you ask me. The reason is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the killer and the murder are revealed at the beginning (although it may be the same for all Columbo films) that do not leave any mystery, but how Columbo solves it, which makes it a bit boring (then There is not much to look forward to at the end of the movie. Pacing is good, there is hardly a scene where you are bored. The action is very good, especially the one by Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some good dialogue exchanges in the movie. The characters are well-written and credible. Dialogue and script are exceptionally good for a TV movie. All in all, the movie is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV movie, and definitely worth watching for any fan of Columbo and / or crime / mystery flicks. 8.10
