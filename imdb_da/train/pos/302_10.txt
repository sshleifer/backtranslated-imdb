This movie is perfect for any romantic in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" hits close to home, is great to watch and so fun to play with. Ben Gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've met Arthur in my travels somewhere. All around, an excellent choice to pick up every night! :-)
