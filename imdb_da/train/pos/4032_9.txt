Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Seen in Partition India, this film shows the true reality of partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional depiction of a suffering woman without any way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family response were taken overnight over a tragic dispute. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as its infamous abductor. There are several moments in the movie where you come to tears. The film at points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are back cooling, but Urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to a woman who gave women freedom in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.
