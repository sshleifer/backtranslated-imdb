After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawyer, a head of the Yukon Gold Fields wins with a bad reputation and little chance of returning to the States. While there are his fortunes, a trip goes for the best until an evil ghost from the past is calling. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.
