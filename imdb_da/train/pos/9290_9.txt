This is not very much the kind of movie John Wayne is famous for. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficial unexciting history. <br /> <br /> For the open mind, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich depiction of an exciting part of history. <br /> <br /> There are two interrelated stories. The great story is interned, isolationist Japan and externally expansionist America that collides when their interests are in conflict. The little human story is an outsider barber (Wayne) and a civilized Geisha's original hostility and does not like to turn to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the greater history of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. The two main roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, who strikes the right mix of power and negotiation with Japanese. Eiko Ando is also excellent as the title Geisha, charming and lovely. The interplay between her character and John Waynes is particularly well portrayed. This is exactly how these two individuals (as depicted in the film) would have performed. <br /> <br /> Scripture is very well written. It lacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the way in which the depicted events may have taken place. The characters are real people, not self-conscious "big" figures from the story. In addition, the collapse of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. In fact, the collapse of a traditional and traditionally powerful isolationist Japan and a rising, innovative nation from across the sea summed up very well in an exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan and that passing ships cannot even come to sea. The Baron responds to Japan's will alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important intersection of international shipping, and that if things continue as before, the nation will be considered as nothing more than a band's brigade's attack on an important roadway. A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as on the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong. The resulting clash between two self-righteous people with conflicting interests has its reflections through history, a continuing theme that echoes into the present and into the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and the depiction of the mid-nineteenth century Japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialization, to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual treat and an enlightening insight into Japan's ancient civilization. I highly recommend anyone, whether a John Wayne fan or not, to watch this movie if you get the chance. Just be aware that it is not an action movie. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slowly boiling love story that (much to their surprise) will dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this movie on its benefits, without prejudices, let yourself be immersed in its history and you will thoroughly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent movie.
