High energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933, The Bowery places salon owner and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy, George Raft, with adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and great Faye Wray in roles playing between their great rivalry. It is not clear exactly what the rivalry is about, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. Lots of wisecracks in the beginning, but the characters soften as the movie progresses. Apart from that, the beautiful extermination of the scenes in Beys salon. The various characters, the sexy choreline, plenty of drinking water, a perfect creation of a pitcher not deterred by so-called pre-code limitations, and later the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation itself. It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that is far away. I don't like comparing epochs, but this movie is totally and completely different from what you would see today. The film has lots of heart and far lost innocence and is definitely a must.
