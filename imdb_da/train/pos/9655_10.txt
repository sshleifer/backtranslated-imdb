Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you have said. I still haven't seen a gay-themed movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative movies with a clear beginning, development and outcome. But European films are less telling, but make you think a lot and feel. Many of you did not understand the feelings of the movies. The purpose of this is not to show us a simple "summer" loving movie "with commercial characters that" fall in love and live forever "Summer vacation and beach are just a backdrop, and this movie is aimed at every young boy who May feel identified with these boys, maybe some of you have not understood this movie because of its 3 parts, shown as flashbacks, these 3 moments are: - Summer time in Pornichet when they meet and love - After a year and Half life together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to a psychiatrician himself, trying to suicide, and Cedric brings him to the hospital, later he looks to talk to a psychiatrist to find the reason he has. The last part is when Mathieu comes back to Pornichet in the winter alone, to think about how his life has changed, how his life is and is trying to find himself. <br /> <br /> It is possible to Some people could not understand all this well, because every scene they are mixed among them. But anyway, as I said before ... it's not a funny movie. If what someone wants to see is meat, we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what we want to show us is how cruel can be life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to go away from home and try to live the kind of life he thought could bring him happiness. But what seemed perfect in the beginning .. later it is not as good as he thought, and he was disturbed and feels that he has lost his way to his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He finally gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So much fun? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is about emotions ... friendship, love, happiness, dissatisfaction, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what the director wanted to do .. one film showing us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best gay-themed movie ever.
