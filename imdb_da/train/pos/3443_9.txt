A convincing, honest, bold and unforgettable psychological horror movie that touches on the painful experiences of rape caused by rape - "Descent" is a film that went under the radar due to lack of distribution because it is honest that the movie is so brutal in His depictions that if it had been released theatrically, it could have met itself for a strong bias. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves to be discovered not only for its dark themes, and not just for its amazing direction and authentic style - but most of all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely astounding, giving enough disease and enough vulnerability to do one but not relate to, but understand this broken man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile uncertainties deep within itself. It is a supportive achievement that is so complex, brave and emotional on the part of Faust. And hard to forget. <br/> <br /> But the standard is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A turn-the-force of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the most subtle yet highly performing performances for some time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting notions in some amazing movies, she shows here that she needs to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving beliefs, credible and thematic. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies of the year (and 2007 was a strong one) - had this undervalued and intelligent movie hit theatrical releases, I would scream for it, as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad it was too blunt for a widespread appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
