This film is head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It's almost flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is captivating and delightful! Each character is particularly lovely and memorable, from the leaders of Cher and Nicolas Cage to the many supportive roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandfather with his dog pack! Each of these artists, plus Norman Jewison as director, performs their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the players, this was an early big exposure in film, so the casting is also unique - and we have many current acting power plants whose career was changed by their effectiveness in this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times all the way through - which in some cases can significantly dampen the effect of a movie. More obviously, a few years ago I understood that when I channeled myself to a scene from this movie - any scene - the scene was convincing and beautifully crafted. There are so many amazing and memorable scenes of the original meeting between Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells her story of way; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold mine plumbing; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney to philandering with his student in the classic line of coherence with colleagues: "Don't eat where you eat!"; Danny Aiello at her dying mother's bed; Nicolas Cage "takes" Cher as the extermination of an aria soars in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden original); When Harry met Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> No one is absolutely equal to Moonstruck!
