Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are fantastic. I've seen Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is amazing. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was a little slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective of a guy just indulged in his drug advice and indolent of what ever happens. At the same time, John Holmes's character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugly situations almost scary. The movie deserves to be seen more than once. The 70s ambience sensual and full of fabrics is amazing.
