In the fifties, age restrictions on film in Brazil were as follows: No restriction, 10 years old, 14 years and 18 years old. Normally, the westerns were allowed for ten years as they had a little more violence, they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restriction for younger than 18. Winchester 73 was one of them and I think it explains a lot well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero James Stewart fought his own brother, who had killed their father. He sought revenge and seemed quite traumatized far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations on this kind of character in the next movies he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from skilled, she followed the man who stayed with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of the great villains who are always remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who remains with the gun, is one of the best suited to a Western. It was supposed to be a Fritz Lang movie that didn't come through. When offered to Mann, he made a point of starting from scratch and not taking anything prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created another view of Western but still maintains all his traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to watch over and over, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it did with those who saw it when it was originally released.
