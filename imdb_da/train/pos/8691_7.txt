Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with the actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see Resnai's family members such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, who deal with serious themes such as death, religion, suicide, love and their overall consequences for our daily lives. The formal nature of relationships shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formula you. In 1984, Resnai spent time making L'amour à mort, memory and space to lift the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also concerned love and memories. The meaning of this movie is high and clear: true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives, leaving doctors to care for their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. It's a movie where musical scores are in perfect tandem with his pictures. This is one of the reasons why this film can be easily understood.
