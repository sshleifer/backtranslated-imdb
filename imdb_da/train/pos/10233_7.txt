I've always been eager to watch Hong Kong movies, but everyone failed to meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor that most HK movies have, nor any other line of line drawn into the movie. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some "intelligent" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts movie I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's no real HK- movie for me). There are some fantastic fighting scenes in this movie, from the first (which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short) to the last headlines! But there is also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is pretty good, and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be fulfilled, although some shots must be quite technical (notice: the sheet of paper he throws and is attached to a wall!). Yep, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure the hell will check out more of this director! Es.
