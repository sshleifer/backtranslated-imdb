This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget film. The action is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the movie is very vain. Gore is well done and used sparingly (beware of excellent deadness of death) and the action is punchy when used. It is true that sometimes there are risky lines in the script, but in comparison with other movies on the same (or larger!) Budget, it is hardly noticeable. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it looks! 8.10
