DO NOT judge this production by the 2-hour version released on VHS in the United States, which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of seeing the 6-hour full-length version available on DVD from the UK and was spellbound. The conscious pace and growing sense of threat are fascinating as the amazing visual and aural landscape; This is an old Rome we have never seen before and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was mistakenly celebrated for his 1968 mini-series The Odyssey, and this mini-series is just as powerful. Like Bekim Fehmiu became the screen's best Ulysses, Klaus Maria Brandauer can be the best Nero on the screen. Now, one day I hope to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide) broadcast on Italian television in 1971. I am indefinite, which version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this one or the Polish mini-series from 2001; each has different virtues, and in many ways complement each other. Certainly, one towers over the Hollywood campsite with Peter Ustinov.
