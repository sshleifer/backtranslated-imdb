Casting is excellent, the actress good, plot interesting, evolution full of excitement ... but it's hard to get all those elements in a movie that is almost 80 minutes long. If more time was taken to develop plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minute drug would have made this a very good movie, rather than just a good one.
