There was some hesitation on my part about what this movie had to offer. Initially, the casting didn't really seem to be right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done really well in "24", and the previve did not seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally ended, I was not completely dissatisfied, because I had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, had the responsible parties taken a little more care to look for the narrative gap and gave a little more care for character development. We have previously seen threats of this type, and that made the main conflict much more challenging for the authors. As the audience we do not want to sit through the same old story again. We want to see something else, be excited and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the casting. From Kim Basinger's delicious first lady. She carries with enough grace and sex complaints to make that part memorable. Michael Douglas has been and done it before. Unfortunately, the president is much of a non-unit to himself to care for his destiny. Sutherland rehashes his "24" hard guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does an acceptable job as a beginner. Don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the trip for whatever it is. It is OK.
