I love this show. Now I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it's similar to them I don't look like. I like the history of film history. I even like the love story, even though I enjoy it, I wonder behind how that part of the story can really evolve when Ned can't touch Chuck or anything ... Now you know. I even like Chuck, I can't find her annoying at all, and I generally hate too cute, beautiful, perfect characters. I even like the narrator's voice, even though it bothers one of my family members and has some resemblance to some Walgreens advertisements. I could nitpick about all the other things about Ned's difficulties and how the authors should address it in the future, but I just look and wait and see what history the authors weave.
