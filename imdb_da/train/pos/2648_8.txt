Really the story of two cocky brothers and their respective fall from grace (via drug addiction) and later redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius that James Franco plays, is your typical sensitive but intelligent human child. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he becomes a dependency, while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. Not too heavily dispensed as fabric factories will be, and all in all, a fairly realistic outline of the family dynamics that drug problems cause. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and praise James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a love work.
