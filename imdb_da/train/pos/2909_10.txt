I love Paul McCartney. He is in my opposition the greatest of all times. However, I couldn't have a ticket for his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the US tour. I was sorry for the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy it in the years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear the whole of Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The biggest single concert DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** out of *****.
