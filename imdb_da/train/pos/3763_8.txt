Now it's more like that! The first movie had a lot of iffy dialogue and some weaker actions, but it seems that the team behind this has their stuff together for the sequel and spread a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, fun and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge Their seats throughout. <br /> <br /> This is just filled with great stuff, full of creativity, and less of a 80's spoof movie at the same time. The scenes in hell are great, and so are those in heaven. There is really no shortage of the crazy adventurous that this law promises, and you will never see another movie like this one. Even the film's hammy-final action is not as bad as the first, which is generally cordial and comfortable in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family-friendly movie bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, despite looking around 30, is not that bad here. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a good deal for me.
