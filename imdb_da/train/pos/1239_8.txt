I think the movie was pretty good, it will add to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters reminiscent of some of the pickier people that it is still a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points speak "logic", but many religious cases accepted "in faith" fail to pass odor tests. If you want to accept whatever you subscribe to, you can definitely accept a movie. Is it just me or others have noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same obsessed knife Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble getting control over "The Shadow". No mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here (IMDB), but I'd bet a dollar to a donut that's the same prop.
