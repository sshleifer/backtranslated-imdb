When I took my place in the cinema, I was in a cool mood and had no plans to change it. But this movie is a dramatic power plant. I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterwards. So what do we have? Theoretically, an adventure story about a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. I thought soon that the plot seemed pretty much borrowed from "Bend it as Beckham", where we had an Indian girl who played football and ruined her sister's wedding. Here we have transferred it to a Turkish girl who destroys her brother's wedding by making Kung Fu. And of course we also have a love story and a competition. After I accepted this, it really turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama, and it shows some beautiful Kung Fu (though I'm not an expert). The leading actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion, but she also delivers an excellent performance, so it seems safe to assume that we have quite autobiographical impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that She has no education as an actress. The rest of supporting casting is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect so they must have done something right. - The audience burst into bowl when our heroine finally hit back and attacked the boys, who grossly beat the brother up in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese film artist Kung Fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this in the cinema, you probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if it also works on a small screen
