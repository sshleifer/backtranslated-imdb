BABY FACE is a fast and clever craze that knows the smirk of a movie that lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes they are <br /> <br />! That a story that covers so much reason could be told in such a short time puts most of today's filmmakers to shame. Screenwriters of <br /> <br /> today should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut up bloated as <br /> <br /> overwhelms so many of their films. <br /> <br /> History is no nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first, <br /> <br /> and then over the bodies of the men who fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Sure, the production code runs out with a redeeming, happy end, <br /> <br /> but it's not hard to see where the direction authors would <br /> <br /> go so enjoy what is and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is amazing, as is George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as a <br /> <br /> rude suitor. Not a good movie, but definitely an enjoyable one. If <br /> <br /> you have never seen BABY FACE, take it the next time it is shown on cable <br /> <br /> or rent the cartridge. It's worth doing.
