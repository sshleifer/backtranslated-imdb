This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. It plays right into the "Multiple Universe" theory. The only thing that doesn't call true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has so much time to understand what's going on, everything has changed. <br /> <br />
