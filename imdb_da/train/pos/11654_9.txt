I agree with the above comment, I love the realism of this, and in many movies (not just movies about eating disorders) the manufacturers seem to forget it. They take a daily problem and create a tremendous dramatic scene and then the end of the movie is all perfect again, which I don't like because it's not reality. It doesn't mean that things can't get better and doesn't mean saying things not in this movie, but it doesn't spend most of the movie that creates all those problems and at the end of the movie everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people not only recognize it and will get better, and then life is peach, it takes time, and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters, we go through the difficulties with them, get better and Worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain in a very realistic way and I loved it. I also love how it shows The secret and betrayal people feel when they suffer from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve it. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favorites.
