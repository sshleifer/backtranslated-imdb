Outside is the story of teenage girls trying to sneak into the stadium to watch the last world championship match in Tehran that can lead Iran to the World Cup in Germany in 2006. Women are forbidden to go to the stadium by law in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and sneak in. Stadium guards are each looking at the entrance to ensure that nobody is carrying fireworks and of course; no girl comes in. <br /> <br /> As most of Panahi's work, his armature cast performance was fantastic. You actually think you see a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the private were performed delicate and amazingly credible. The film depicts the interplay between prisoners and the crafted guards who even serve mandartory away from their family and friends in a fun way. In the end, the audience realizes that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards who just followed orders.
