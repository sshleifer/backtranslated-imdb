I first saw it in the early 90s on UK TV, I liked it so, but I missed the chance to lose what many years went by, but the film always stuck with me and I lost the hope that see it again, the most important thing What was stuck with me was the end, the hole slot part really touched me, it's easy to see, has a great story, good music, the list goes on and on again, that's OK, I say where good it is, but everyone will take there even the best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to see, it shows its age in a few parts but it has now become a part of the beauty I am so happy that it has come out on DVD, as it is one of my top 10 movies at all times. Buy it or rent it just watch it, it is best to watch at night alone with drinks and food in range, so you don't have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
