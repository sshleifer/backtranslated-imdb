There is something convincing and weird about this episode. From the beginning, a tension atmosphere is created by the knowledge that a particular planet will explode within hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have stroked to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom apparently have already left for unknown parts, except for an older librarian. The librarian's polite but cryptic advice on where all citizens have gone is interrupted by a crisis where all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly embroiled in different time periods of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a period similar to the 17th century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The link between the two stories and the various dangerous situations in which the men are located is handled excellently, with the return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes count down to the planet's explosion. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman banished to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urban librarian. Something reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time's travel story is a rich and compelling finale for the series that ended an episode later. This should be one of the best in the whole series, especially notable considering the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.
