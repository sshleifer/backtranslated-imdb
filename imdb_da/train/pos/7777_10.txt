Rig, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stack's nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, lust for Rock. Throw a couple of complications and the movie goes without control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> Very shiny film in beautiful Technicolor with jaw-dropping fashion and furniture (check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, bold clothing. Basically, it is a soap opera with class A production values. The story itself is very fun and part of the dialogue at first is hilarious over the top. The action of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is amazing ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees went weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is amazing - she has earned the best supporting actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, vicious and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny trash. Do not miss it!
