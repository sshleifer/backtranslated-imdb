Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Somehow I haven't seen anything like this before, so it was crazy! That is of course a good thing. It's a humorous interesting movie, and my absolute absolute favorite thing is how they blend in one! Like chicken little, the fish pretends to be King Kong and Around the Pig, who say, "Twas Beauty, Who Killed the Beast", the World War scene and more. Walt Disney Company may not have lost its touch not to this one. Also, how they did it as if they saw a movie and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> But some parts don't fit. Like in the original lion king, Timon and Pumbaa were not Simba when he beat Scar? In this movie they are not! they fought on the backstage of hyena. Ther is more why Pumbaa is not so sure he was pushed away by the other animals, and it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told while pumbaa only had flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's SO GREAT!
