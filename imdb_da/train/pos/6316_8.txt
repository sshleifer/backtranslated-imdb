This is not a "loose", but a precise, faithful remake of the 1958 Monicelli's classic "In Soliti Ignoti" with Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinal, etc. And that is the reason for the good, it copies all the fun characters and plot , even in detail (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I've seen the amazing old version many times, and I knew in the heart all the gangs and the end, but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood" which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how life and the way of the small twenties in the 1950s Italy is adapted to the 2002 United States. Things haven't changed much. 8.10.
