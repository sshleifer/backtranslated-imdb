Heartland was in production at the same time as Michael Ciminos Himmelens Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to do, but is 10 times the film piece. Sky Gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40 mile in 1980!) Hollywood flops from all the time resulted in its failure in the sale of the United Artists studio for MGM" imdb entry <br/> <br /> Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefit from great writing, direction, photography and acting. It draws you lightly into the beauty, joys, hardships, and grief of pioneer life. It's boring that at times Hollywood will pour millions in turkeys (based on a director's only big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story.
