The whole character of Pacino's reproduction of the speech over the coffin of the dead child; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader, or was it Ken Lipper to compliment the remarkable dialogues? They are rich and intelligent and worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found the story story to develop quite well right up to the voice-over postscript. <br /> <br /> There is little else to talk about in this movie; even John Cusack has done better roles than this one. Interestingly, the film is very male-oriented - the women are only random.
