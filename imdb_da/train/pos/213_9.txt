Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has since been angry. This is the prerequisite for this hilarious Neil Simon game made for a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is more fun than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines like Matthaus's nephew and agent. There are even old clips of actual stars in the golden era to get you into the trail of the movie, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts it all with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started in the thirties in theater with Orson Welles and later became grandmother of "Family Matters", plays a big role in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with it (and maybe I am too fussy and / or serious) is how Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Granted, he has had a lot of anger all these years, but some of the things he does will be considered rude or simply bad manners taken out of context. I'm also used to seeing Matthau acting like that in other movies, but not to George Burns. And Matthaus's bully tends to be a little old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a consistent fun movie that helps and forgets your problems, put in "The Sunshine Boys." They lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You're gonna slip it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait. I think you should slip it."
