I have read most comments on this movie. I have seen this movie (and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages we all enjoy, and it has just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible on cleanup and end times. No one was scared or traumatized as I read in some posts. The movie is just based on biblical facts. I have seen a lot of end-time movies "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and so on and far this is one of the best in presenting the truths of the Bible. It may not have many special effects like today's movies, but I think it's a good witness tool. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed for free at this website higherpraise.com and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.
