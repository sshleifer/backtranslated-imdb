What a great episode for this fine series. This is TV top quality at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully recorded in black and white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and strong images. This is a story of two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals face in the 1960s in America. Written by the amazing Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. Taking such a sensitive issue makes this episode more amazing. Our emotions are so torn and on the edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's beautiful, "Ah, but I was so much older when I'm younger than now" as it was sung by Byrds. This goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
