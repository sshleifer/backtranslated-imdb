American Icon Henry Fonda depicts "Elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rich "Eleanor" resumed after a prolonged hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments. Deciding that he would like to make another perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals Eleanor and chops along with the old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan) who needs to move her troop prostitutes. /> <br /> Fonda's wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a movie that draws in the heartbeat as effectively as it tickles the fun leg in the more comical scenes. An excellent cast, including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a lovely ham as always in the most blatant comic part of the picture) helps immensely. <br /> <br /> The ultimate life-affirmative character of the image and the travel poignancy carries incredible weight; This is a picture that brought you into it, remember long after it's over. The promise of the open road is alive shown here; The landscape just looks beautiful. Seen by Craig Safan's wonderful music score, it is a remarkable image for aesthetics. It loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are a little more than the intrusion), but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its core characters. Not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock image one might expect from the title (especially its alternative title "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without nausea. <br /> <br /> 9/10
