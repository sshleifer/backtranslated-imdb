If your fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see! Seen in the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerously not only has great actors but good lines. "ban the wall of the data, ban down that wall and knock down that # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny" or "sounds like Johnny's being laid". It is definitely a spear on the old James Cagney Movies and refers them a lot. There is a fantastic scene when Jhonny's goes down the death row and has a priest set up for his escape. Listen carefully to the false priests' readings, it's pretty fun. Another big scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Seeing his reaction to Johnny after he spoke the pope, said a lot without making a sound. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh or is old movie buffs.
