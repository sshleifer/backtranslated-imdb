I do not want to go into much detail about the plot of this movie, as other reviewers have largely covered the same reason. <br /> <br /> Just wanted to say I really enjoyed the movie a lot. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film. <br/> <br /> A small-scale 'road trip' movie with Falk & Paul Travel in upstate NY this fall is the setting for most of the movie in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very well written with an adult audience in mind. Lots of reality-based humor and some well-played drama gives the film a feeling that it could be your own family. <br /> <br /> Really can't say enough about this movie, except that it's a shame that's a great movie so you don't get any more exposure while there is no other trashy junk out there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk again with a great lead role and he makes the most of it. It proves that his famous friend and author / director John Casavettes was just about to cast Falk into many of his groundbreaking films from the 60s and 70s.
