This movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a non-stop action packet story with tons of gun actions and explosions. This movie had surprisingly many good phrases. The reason is solid despite what others might think it kept my interest all the time until the end. Finally; This is a great way to get an action movie to spend time on.
