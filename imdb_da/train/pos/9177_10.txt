I must say that these miniseries were the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible like Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but no one compares to this. The best thing for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. The last time I saw this was in 1984 when I was only 13. At that time I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was totally enchanted by these miniseries, and I don't remember missing any of the episodes. I'd like to see it again because it's so good. :-)
