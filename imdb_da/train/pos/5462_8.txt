First of all, if you are planning to see this, be sure to see the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then see scenes manipulated due to censorship), it makes a big difference. This film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced to prostitution by her own father since 14 years. When her father suddenly goes away, she is able to go into the world alone. Having read about Nietzsche's philosophies of life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men to give her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, she is becoming more materialistic and manipulative, and the audience is beginning to wonder that she has any kind of morals at all. Generally, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant sexuality scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white movie. Although no sexual acts are explicitly displayed on the screen, it is very clear what is happening outside the camera. I enjoyed it very much to watch this movie a lot, and I think most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out, especially with the movie's shock value. I was thinking, while I was watching, that the pacing seemed a bit slow on parts, but I think for most movies it's the first time to watch them. In fact, I think almost all movies I've seen made from the early 30s had some minor pacing problems or some parts just not quite "flow" right. This was probably only the craft of film making was not completely perfected yet? It would take just a few years. Compare a 1939 movie and compare it to an early 30 movie and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm very happy to see the original cut; It really makes a big difference. Also, any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.
