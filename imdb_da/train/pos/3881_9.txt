This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence that tricked me into a complete turn of perspective, so I was combed when the title came on. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a difficult way like Identity or Exceptional Suspects, but in the way we all try to do whatever banal life, we find ourselves a little more interesting. The scenes in the chicken stocks are spectacular. At one point, JÃ¸rgen (who owns the chicken coop) participates in a seminar in laughter, where he is the worst student. His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his longing to change himself. The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There is not much plot here. Guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. This movie appealed to me just as Sideways did, even though the characters couldn't be more different.
