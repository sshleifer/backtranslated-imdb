Maybe I'm biased to foxes, fox stories and everything, but I thought it was wonderfully done. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed being shown when Lily wasn't comfortable, like the fire and the room (not trying to spoil too much here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. After reading a few other comments, I am a little confused, saying that at the end-spoiler-mother and her son appear as she has been the one who tells her son about her story. The movie I saw did not have the mother or son at the end, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can anyone tell me about that? Still, I really enjoyed this movie, though some scenes may be a bit slow, which can be difficult for high energy children to sit through. Worth it if they can sit still.
