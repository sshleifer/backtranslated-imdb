While it was filmed on a Florida National Guard site, "Tigerland" reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, firing ranges, maneuvering areas, waist deep water and everything. The movie was pretty authentic and the characters look the same on my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year 1971 and mine in 1974 is all the drill sergeant and the instructors knew they should not return to Vietnam, as it was pretty much everywhere, so the training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. It was the forerunner of all our problems in the 70s and 80s, as I know for a fact when I stayed until 2004. I have never heard anyone mention "Tigerland" but the army had realistic Vietnam training towns on different bases over USA Vietnam Vets tells me that in 1972 Basic & AIT could be quite tough and robust because the coaches were there and got the mandate to educate Vietnamese men these skills to do it, though not always. Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Know NCOs as we became instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me that there was nothing they could do to get someone ready and people just had to figure out and figure out for themselves. This movie is high.
