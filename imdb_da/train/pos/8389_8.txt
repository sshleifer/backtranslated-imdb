This is the best of the 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; his most successful at least. He was one of the leading directors of the new Germany after World War II. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was magnificent as the cold, and Maria Bruan, who lost her husband to the war, found him after taking an American soldier as a lover he lost after he went to jail for her and found him agin at the end. Her one and a half wedding before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end. <br /> <br /> That's life. Things come and go and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust your way of thinking to survive. Although Mary adjusted her mindset and did what she should do, she never stopped loving Hermann, making such a tragedy to the end. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
