Yes, a true classic! It is about British drama, realism and minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestrial television in 1994. It should really be seen by anyone who likes a scary plot, not big names, but no less big plays. Unfortunately, copywrite is now owned by someone unknown, and as such, this great drama is not likely to be sent soon. I recently acquired The Woman In Black at VHS, so now I will be able to enjoy this truly amazing British drama again. You should also try it! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
