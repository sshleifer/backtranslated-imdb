This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his films and actually had a plot that could be followed. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is a fantastic, underrated actress. There were some moments that could have been a little more out of the way, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room do it, but all in all, it's worth the price to rent and see it. The action was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his distinctive speech to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts well.
