At first glance, I expected this movie to be crazy because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previously published comments, I agree that the feminist part of this movie does not bother. I never thought that the protagonist exaggerated her position as a woman. It's like Guzman is presented as someone with a spine, this as opposed to her classmates. So I was surprised at the story, I actually thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps it would have been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist, so the viewer is a little more surprised. In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez received his respect for the way she removed her character. I can't really explain why, but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. It just looked right, I think. I gave it a 7 out of 10, only because of the boring last half hour.
