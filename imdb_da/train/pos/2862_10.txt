My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. This amazing series was one of the first to be removed on television, and it was very influential in persuading Americans to purchase a color television set that was about $ 800 in 1959, equivalent to more than $ 3,000. Today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of seeing a show transferred by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series began and I saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> When you see it now, 50 years later, more things come to mind. First, many of the history's lines involve Comstock Lode and the silver mining ceremony dating back to 1859. In 1859, weapons and clothing are mostly not authentic. (The hair clippers are out of the discussion.) It's basically a nitpick. And it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and have assembled a 100-square-mile ranch for the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem as late as 1847, and Gold Rush did not even begin two years later. Indians are not played by Native American actors. John Ford used Indians in the 1920s. The Bonanza producers could easily have done thirty years later. It's a great nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other timeline issues. In season 1, Mark Twain appears and he is depicted as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also stagger between 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and what was more suitable for an 1880 timeframe. There are continuity issues over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is also a daunting thing that there is so much killing in the first season. In time, the killing was reduced. Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slope that would be hard to believe in the timeline, but give the authors credit to predict the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes that began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> After all, it's all right, and I have come to conclude in recent years that Adam's character was better drawn than anyone else. I don't think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved. Season 1 also reinforces that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. Many of the stories track real historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was great family entertainment, and the range goes very well with any action.
