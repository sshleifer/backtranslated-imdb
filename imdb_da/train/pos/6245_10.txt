"Dog Stage" is Seidl's first fiction film (before he directed great documentaries such as "wildlife" or "models"). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but it only cost about $ 2 million. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who almost played themselves.the cinematography is also good. The whole movie is shockingly disturbing, and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. the film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and not able to communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films in recent years. please excuse my bad english. <br /> <br />
