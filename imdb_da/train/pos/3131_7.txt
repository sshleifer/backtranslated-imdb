I really enjoyed this. I made it think that it should be a documentary, but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in the cheek's fun. <br /> <br /> I think it has been well done, pretty much an expanded TV show in a movie, but because of the signs or rather the willingness of original actors to have fun and be fun, this helps work with a great old style innocent way. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original TV shows then I'm sure you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Q
