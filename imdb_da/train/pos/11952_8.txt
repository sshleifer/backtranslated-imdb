Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite instructor, but I enjoyed the "Match Point". It was an excellent dark romantic thriller who fortunately did not steal Woody Allen. It had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody's Allen's latest movie, and even though he looks in it, it's okay. It also has Scarlett Johansson, and the two work perfectly together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets a lifetime from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.). Joe heard the scoop on a boat with the ugly reaper and a lot of other souls that Reaper has taken. One of these souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter can be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with a lifetime tip, returns to the living and provides this information to Sondra during a magical act. Sondra is on a magical show with magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She volunteers to go into a vanishing box, and while in the box, she gets a visit from Joe. She doesn't know what to do, she listens to Sid Waterman's help to help her crack the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lovely light hearted feel to "Match Point" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work well together. Allen's humor fits perfectly with this story and role. Hugh Jackman is great as Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little movie to see if you are ever looking for someone to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that you see Woody Allen himself. I say give it a try because you just like it.
