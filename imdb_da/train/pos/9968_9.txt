My mother took me to watch this movie as a kid, and I long to see it every year as I do all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most was the stupid devil and Santa looking through his telescope. I waited and looked through T.V. Guide every year after that to see when it would appear. I would normally find it on a Saturday afternoon. I only found the movie in English, which took something special away from the film and longed to find a copy of it in Spanish. I keep this movie dear to my heart and never have a bit of nightmare that others could suggest. Yes, it's another movie about Santa Claus, and that's what makes it special and unique. I can't wait to get a copy of this movie and see it with my kids as I explain my favorite parts and memories !!
