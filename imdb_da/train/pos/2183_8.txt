Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unintentional touch is noticeable in this completely original story of ghostwriting songwriters, both working for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings have gone out of the way pretty fast, thank you sky, and what's left is a witty and breezy concoction with some nice songs (and some more forgettable ones), Crosby on his most charming, great tour of Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant give most cynical barbs (Levant is in rare form and his quips have not dated at all). A wonderful surprise and recommended to all fans of the genre.
