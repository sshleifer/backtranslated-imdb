A classic series that must at least be repeated or published on DVD.Billy Toth, after acknowledging that he was adopted after the death of his parents, begins on a journey to find his real parents. After various rites of passage, his search culminates in the discovery that his father's identity was stolen and used by a human trafficking in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian (?) Ski slopes and a cliff over which results in Billy's father's in-laws becoming dead. This series was all filmed at locations in various destinations across Europe and seemed polished and incredibly well-crafted with some episodes that cross into the film's nodes and crime scene. The main arch was often obscured by the slices of life, Billy went through in his years of living Finding the secrets of his mother and fathers. A class works, but underestimated and forgotten.
