Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I liked it, but as I did not want to sleep yet and nothing else was on, I continued to look and felt fascinated by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi created recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume drama. Great games, great cameras, good music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)
