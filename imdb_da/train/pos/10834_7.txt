I didn't have "Still Crazy" with any real expectation. Just another rock'n'roll picture, I figured ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partly it, but so much more. Brian Gibson, the director, formerly the hell of a biography of Tina Turner, is quite successful in his style. I suppose it was appropriate that this was his last movie. <br /> <br /> Cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the band's front man. Actor-turned director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's washed guitarist. He does a fantastic job, even though he has not appeared on films since the late 70s. If you're looking for a touching and fun movie (with some good songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
