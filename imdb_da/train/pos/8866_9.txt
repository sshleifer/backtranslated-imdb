"COSBY," in my opinion is a must-see CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've ever seen every episode, but I've still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you ask me even though I liked everybody, it would be great if Madeline Kahn hadn't gone away during the show. Since it happened, I've always wondered what the performance would have been like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend that you just catch it if it goes well in the air
