Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, each person has the special place that he loves more than anyone else. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most prominent directors today as they went to enrich the eternal love of the special place and portray situations in its citizens and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris du t'aime, where our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a fantastic stroll through Parisian arrondissements, human emotions, longings and expectations. /> <br /> Always a second quarter, always a completely moving story of ordinary people in search of love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, subway station. And Paris you t'aime is about a wide variety of love - love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us, but are no longer around, love to revive, serendipitic love for the stranger, When your eyes meet, or love that just isn't supposed to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film is not just about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, the ups and downs of everyday life. And the most important quality is the fact that it is not as fun but warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9 because the last section of it suggests how some of the stories may evolve further, but not all of them, and that's what I find lacking and by "developing "I do not mean any specific reference to the characters' future. As for everything else, I can only say captivating. Make you leave everything behind you, escape to Paris and live the little romances yourself.
