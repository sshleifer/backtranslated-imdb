I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to see. Not this one. It's just a great movie, an old-fashioned story - and based on a real guy, I did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who is spoken of trying, late in life athletic speech, to become a jar in professional baseball. Eventually he reaches his goal of making it big leagues, even though it was very short time. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, the kind you fight for, from Quaid to players at his high school, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a star on television.) /> <br /> Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike previous sports film players, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a jar, a guy who could burn it 90 plus miles an hour. And most of this movie is true, as witnessed by the real jug in a documentary on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a great inspirational true life sport movie, you can't go wrong with this one.
