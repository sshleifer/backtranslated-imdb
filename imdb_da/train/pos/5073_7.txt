This documentary drama is what you expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly cast, well-written in the measured, literary way that Hollywood discarded in the 30s and exactly precisely. It stands out as a genre film that distinguishes itself in its depiction of native Americans (or more appropriately for its Canadian attitude, "First Nations") culture and stands with "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe land and its culture (here around 1934). This idyllic portrait comes out of drama from its subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (UK) by maidens who were then obsessed with the "red Indian" stories of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into the forest and became a staircase and adopted the son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and leaving <br /> <br /> Indian brides, none of whom seem to think of him less, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (a smarter than he, by most accounts) drove him to fame as an author and early advocates protecting the wild land in the north, and this is the focus of Attenborough's narrative. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Gray Owl's wife Pony) is engaging, and if it's not fired, it's still touching. A good movie when you need some time from the madding crowd.
