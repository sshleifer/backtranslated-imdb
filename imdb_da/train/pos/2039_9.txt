Firstly, I would like to point out that people who have criticized this film have made some clear mistakes. Everything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly complete fool. <br /> <br /> Creep is an amazing movie with amazing movie effects. The actors are very credible, the narrative thought growth and horror and graphic content are extremely disruptive. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this movie. Many issues arise when the audience is revealed to the strange and freakish creature that creates habitats in the dark rat clearing tunnels. How was 'Craig' created, and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A great movie with a big chill factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. Look forward to more of these amazing movies !!
