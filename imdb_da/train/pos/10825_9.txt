Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate for their television work. However, their film work has been much more routine. (2008 is the Bank's job was fine, last year's entire universe is definitely weak). <br /> <br /> Still, Crazy is fortunately a solid success. It has a great story, great performances, a lot of humor, fabulous music and all other true heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy "moments" and this movie has one of them - just when everything goes pear-shaped at the festival reunion ... <br /> <br /> Absolutely comfortable.
