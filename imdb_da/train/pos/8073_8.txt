An excellent portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in Oscar's winning performance) who is hounded by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward under Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion. The scenes showing fighting and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on desperation within individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate that is worse than death. Director John Ford creates a spooky and exciting atmosphere, enhanced by the fog and ugly portrayal of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic joy. Oscar winner also for best script, nominated for best picture. This is one of Hollywood's Classic.
