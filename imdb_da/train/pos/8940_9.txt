The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heart-breaking books I've ever read. It tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both of whom have earned devotion and respect, work well in their 70s as a teacher and dentist, and then lived another 30 years of dignity. Ruby Dee steals the movie with its perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious "blacker" Bessie, the dentist. She expresses not only her anger, fear and wisdom; She lets you know exactly where they have come from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, perfectly, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe she's over 100. Whatever the stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is a little too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter. This is also only a minor distraction. The stories are just the right attraction, and although two or three are slightly damaged in the translation, they go almost completely. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as important reading to anyone I recommend any book to. I can't quite but this television movie in the rare air, but it certainly takes enough of the taste to be extremely worthy in itself.
