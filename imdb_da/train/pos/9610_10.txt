I shouted my heart out and looked at this movie. I never have a bit of an eating disorder, but I think it must be a real image. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is great! She expresses these feelings incredibly well. My teenage years came back to me so vividly. Anyone who has undergone difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie. I recommend you all to see it! <br /> <br /> The music is also amazing - I have now discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I also look forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Olives because I am positive, she fits perfectly into Agnes role.
