I recently watched this movie because of Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I figured I wanted to see the movies I missed. I had no expectation to go into the movie, so it was astonished that I had missed this movie at all. It is a poignant father and son story, and it is also an underdog story. I even ran a tear in the final of this wonderful story. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it lowers a little in the middle, but it comes back strongly at the end. The action was great, the story was magnificent, and the filmmaker was captivating considering the film's attitude. GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Rent it, buy it, see it, LOVE it! I know I did!
