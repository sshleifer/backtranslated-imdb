Another for the Babes & Bullets crowd. The story is much more than any other musical I've seen: guns hide the women's missing legs and place them generously in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the local area. More effective than today's 'drama'. It is difficult to identify with a woman holding a gun up in the pants. Exactly remarkable if you are considering the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the cannon up in the leg, giving 90% of the surprises, this film also curls how greed replaces all other considerations in life for a group of yakuzers pursuing a woman holding her leg up a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (therefore no group player or tongs). The hidden projectile launcher pulled out from behind the protagonists back, apparently from nowhere in the Miike's Dead or Alive (1999), the Fuck brought forth the heroine to the end of the original Tomie (2000) or the harrowing flame-thrower scene in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all testifying to an almost third-world Cantinflas esquire influence in the contemporary Japanese cinema that I lose to explain but can't complain. <br /> <br /> You won't see good quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood, it's all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill, anything but ridiculous. This is a real movie, and while it's great in its entirety, the end is a brilliant, if not unnoticed, rip-off of some Sergio Leon images involving guns where the legs should be and certainly are appropriate!
