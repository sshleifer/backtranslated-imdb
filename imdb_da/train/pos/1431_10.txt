This is simply the most amazing movie you will ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it's really something else. It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I don't want to talk about the quality of the pictures, because of course, by other comments, it's unmatched. <br /> <br /> The Earth is fun, excited and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you are sad, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, but we do not appreciate It a little. /> <br /> This film should be shown mandatory in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you'll ever see, so go see it. Who knows, maybe the last time we might see our planet here ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would easily judge it more if it was possible.
