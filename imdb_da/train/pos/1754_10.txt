This movie starts hilariously from about 15 seconds of mark, and continues the whole movie. I can't remember a scene where I didn't turn to look at people laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were amazing to watch from actors who weren't big or popular. As you can see people like this movie, it is currently rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's say this way, I haven't seen this fun of a movie since American Tart or the original vacation. See it if you want a laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs I've ever given since I found out about IMDb, great movie site.
