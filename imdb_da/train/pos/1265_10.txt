hi .. I just consider one of my favorite Sean Connery's films, it's a thrilling psychological thriller with excellent performances from Cast, especially Connery. It also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good in this one. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean's interviews Ed Harris character in prison is just great .. I enjoyed this one a lot and I can't recommend it enough, you really can't miss this one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that say the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really find just because a very entertaining movie ..
