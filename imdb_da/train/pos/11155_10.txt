The young, beautiful, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York and thinks he'll live by being a stud. He comes there and finds out that it is not going to be easy - he goes through a degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope, he breaks up with crayfish Razo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of town and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very ugly portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. That way it's dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it's cleared up considerably now. He also uses every camera trick in the book - color turns to black & white; trippy dream sequences; flash forward; flashbacks (especially involving a rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you are called. It keeps you disoriented and out of the center - but I couldn't stop seeing. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a story - basically based on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an influence that they might have been lovers (the last shot kind of shows it). It is only a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel city jungle. This was originally classified X in 1969 - the only reason being that MPAA did not believe that parents would want their children to see this. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high school students (then X meant no one under 17). It has also been the only X-rated movie ever to win an Oscar as the best picture. Hoffman and Voight were up for appearances which were (mysterious) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture (maybe) 5 minutes! It was eventually lowered to an R (without cuts) when it was distributed in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" was introduced in this movie - and became a big hit. </ br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give it a 10. Don't watch it on commercial TV - it's cut to band and incomprehensible.
