This film is proof that film noire is a lasting style and highly worth keeping alive. For me, this is his best example of film noire since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it will never get the recognition it deserves. It was never promoted properly as it was first released and had to build its cadre of fans through places like Vanguard Cinema and mouth for rental referrals. I highly recommend that people search for something more than mindless Entertainment rent this movie and fit into their highly intricate plot.
