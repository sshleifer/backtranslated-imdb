I look like many bad Trekkers (or Trekkies, I don't care!) Through seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager" and dreamed of a better show when it was over, and regretted the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. replied. "Enterprise" is amazing. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, amazing new pictures, a pop song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can't think of anything I didn't like. Sign up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager," no one misses you! Continue with Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
