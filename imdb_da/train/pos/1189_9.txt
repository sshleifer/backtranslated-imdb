The last hunt is one of the few Westerns ever made to handle Buffalo hunting, both sports and business and as a way to win the plains of Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have American Bison crews as large as some of our largest cities. At the time of the period The last hunting has been suspended, buffalo had been anything but wiped out. The 20th century due to the efforts of conservation companies experienced a revival in the population of the species, but it was hardly as if it was once. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger co-starring in another movie together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were valiant. Here is Stewart Granger the good guy, a world tired buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations. The partner he is chosen to throw in is Robert Taylor. Forgetful Taylor at the moment I doubt whether there has ever been a more cruel, soul soul than Charlie Gilsen, whom Taylor portrays. In the devil's doorway, he was an American Indian who fought against prejudices raised by a racist Louis Calhern played. In The Last Hunt he is the racist here. He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal their mules and take the widow to a prisoner. As a barbaric conqueror, he expects the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. He's actually angry when Paget doesn't see it that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half-hearted, I was never really convinced he was part Indian. That's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> But Lloyd Nolan, the grizzled old buffaloes Taylor and Granger bring, are just amazing. Nolan steals every scene he is in the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who like their western real who want to see a side of Robert Taylor who has never been on the screen and who doesn't like cheap heroines, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
