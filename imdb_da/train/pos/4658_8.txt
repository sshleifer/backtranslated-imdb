Talk about a dream cast - only two of the most wonderful actors who have ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in the "Hot Millions", a fun and fun comedy that was also Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who receives a resume from a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a stand on a solid board of Malden - for the purpose of overcoming it in mind. It's not smooth sailing; He has attracted his competitor's attention to the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a short period. She can't hold a job, and she's seen in the whole movie in a number of jobs - everything ends with her being fired. When Newhart progresses to her, she invites Ustinov to her apartment for curry as cover-up, but the two soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course she doesn't know that Ustinov is a villain. It's such a good movie - you can't help loving Ustinov and Smith and being fascinated by Ustinov's armies, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there is a twist ending that will show you who really has the brain. Don't miss this movie set in the 60s in London. It's worth it if only to hear Maggie Smith whine, "I've been fired."
