I am a parent of a special needs child, and I have had very good in the film! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. In particular, I thought it was sweet how all the other characters were concerned about Frankie, and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. I participated in a focus screening of the movie with other parents and siblings with special needs children before the movie was edited. Everyone enjoyed the movie, and it actually inspired wonderful discussions. We talked about how our children make us laugh, and we also talked about how we care about them. The writer wrote about how she works with autistic children and other special needs children as volunteers for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has got us through some very stressful times. I give the movie two thumbs up !!!
