I was too young to know much about prince, but in the last couple of years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee's and I thought they were cool, but I didn't want to buy a shirt, I didn't know anything about . So on a Saturday it came on security and I decided to see it. I didn't know what the movie was going to do before I saw it, but it was good when I found out. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but as the "child". All the shows how great for me, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs tied to what was going on in the movie when his mother and father always struggled with the song, as pigeons cried out describing what he felt. I also like how wise the prince was with the way he whistled with Apallonia. I liked when Prince and Appallonia first met in the club and he was behind her and then she turned around. good movie and now i can't even find one of the tee shirts :(
