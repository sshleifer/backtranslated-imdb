This is a good movie, a good family movie to see if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in primary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new kid in town named Billy. He makes a bet with the school's bully and the bet is not like most games. Billy has to eat 10 worms in a day or the bullet wins. <br /> <br /> The play is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. The child actors over exaggerate on many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy doesn't eat the worms. However, Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job. <br /> <br /> The baseline is good as a movie, but it sucks like a book fit. I could see this movie without looking at the time .... sometimes. All in all, it was a good family movie with some weak points. I rate this movie 7/10.
