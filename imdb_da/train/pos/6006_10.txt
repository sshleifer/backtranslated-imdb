When I saw this as a child, it answered all my questions and removed any fears or misunderstandings that I had. It is easy to see because it is animated, making it uncomfortable. It has no moral disturbances or "preaching" aspects, so no one has to object to it. It is a comfortable movie that merely provides menstrual facts in a soothing "matter-of-fact" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
