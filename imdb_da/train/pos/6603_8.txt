I have to mention two mistakes for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded in failing: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were fond of the concepts of these two movies and felt terribly disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy the Renaissance. It immerses you into a future in Paris. It's not quite dystopic. They made the animation so good that I thought it was rotoscoped, but from what I can tell, it was not, it was merely trapping. The facial expressions are amazing! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well shown in an animation / live hybrid. The black and white medium is used to slowly focus your attention on the subject's subject; My favorite effect was what they did with headlights beams, beware of it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but ultimately you're happy to find the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a hard and greedy city world filled with small surprises. The reason is secondary, but it's not terrible. It's noir-ish. There is a backstory for most of the great characters that give them a depth. There is weather. There are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is something and even a car chase. I have to see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see it as "set" is detailed and the credits are small.
