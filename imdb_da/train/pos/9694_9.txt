I was entranced by this touching and funny movie, not to mention surprised. I was also surprised to find out that Paulie's voice was performed by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, neither ventured into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger that I thought this must be something unsung old pro, not the baby-face Mr. Mohr. A very impressive performance, yes, and it is gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a number of exciting indie films.
