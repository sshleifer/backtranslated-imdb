Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally fun this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, not even the Norman Jewison Director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note in this amazing work is "When the Moon hits your eye like a great Pizza Pie, it's Amore," a song sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many), and it continued to have a long afterlife in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and doesn't have to fall in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) undertakes to offer her her pinkie ring as a replacement for an engagement ring and rushes out to Sicily to be with her dying mother. He instructs Loretta to see his brother-in-law Ronny attend the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. Everything goes out eventually, as it inevitably does in movies of this genre. Meanwhile, all the actors uncover admirably, and the audience enjoys themselves. In its way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be best: rollicking entertainment without any social significance at all. If they had only lost "It's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
