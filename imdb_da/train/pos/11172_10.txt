Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I read the book first and decided to watch the movie). First of all, the plot is really original and one of a kind. The action is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (playing Fred Gwynne) perfectly fits his role and really sells it to you. There are also a few corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they should be corny) but they will really brighten up the mood and give a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect place to film this movie, and that kind of draws you into the whole movie. Not only will you love it but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan !!
