Once in a lifetime, that means once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and no one comes in or out of `The Life 'for free. The neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run fraud because they can't do it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record or drug abuse or because they're just lazy. This simple story with a few twists on mostly disgusting characters manages to give compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for one another. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all hoodlums have nicknames), and is based on his game, "Riff Raff." It feels like a game from start to finish, especially in the longest stage where the three main players squares to determine who can trust. Often the dialogue comes very quickly, much faster than it would on stage, and I think it is the movie's biggest mistake. Mixed as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street, a kind of iambic pentameter rap that is violent and evocative of the world this movie describes. The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these hoodlums, who murder, cheat and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or in our contempt. The disturbing thing about this movie is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last one suffers from the conscience, while the audience wonders or even laughs at the mercy of irony that requires him to hang in the gallows to tell jokes in the middle of his death.
