One of the most appealing features of a Gilliam movie is that the well-framed images, the disturbing scenery and the manic-frustrated characters are indicative of the creators' inclusion. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some rental directors who are paid to have a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 Monkeys" are signs of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire: repressive / recessive societies, loneliness of the protagonist, the frustration of unbelievers and parallel realms. In this film, Gilliam does a fine job of blurry lines between the two worlds and uses ambiguities to force the audience to believe, rather than know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill some gaps leads to criticism of the art house's pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all his images are significant. Cole's two almost identical bathing scenes have begun to draw comparisons that leave the audience uneasy. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in the disease-touched future world, but makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the bulk of the story to be carved out for its importance to be fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to see yet, also requires thought and interpretation from the audience. The movie has a huge re-watch value as there are subtle details and tips that can be missed at the first impression. Definitely one of my favorites.
