Just considering that it is based on the most infamous mass of suicide event in modern times, it would have been enough to give this 2-part-1980 movie attention. But the fact is that it is a fantastic recreation of Rev. Jim Jones' life, which built a church in a virtual empire and then urged it to disintegrate into a sad cult where a congressman and his affiliation were murdered 917 cult supporters committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid doused with cyanide. Performed very tastefully but terrifyingly, unlike the eerily sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED, GUYANA TRAGEDY has an all-star cast, including Ned Beatty (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it is Powers Boothe (in his first major role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. He is actually the man, and his performance is riveting and chilling. Thus, it is no wonder that this movie still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
