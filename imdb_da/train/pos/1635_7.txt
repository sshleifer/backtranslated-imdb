Back in my colleges in Salina Kansas, they filmed something called "The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg" locally, and the film staff was quite prominent for weeks. Eventually, we learned that the film was "up the academy" and was a bit ummm, "lower forehead" than we had been led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it since I was there, and the local audience seemed less than happy to show. I was 17, and thought it was a pretty nasty attempt at a post "Animal house" type comedy right down to the fix jokes. <br /> <br /> Looked it many times ago and my opinion has mellowed a little. It's stupid, but sometimes it catches a bit of the "crazy" magazine humor, at least as well as most "Mad TV". Ron Liebman could hate it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment had been a short scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I had parked my car while I bought some guitar strings. Too bad, my Pinto's short look, usually seems to be cut to television. have not seen the new dvd, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
