I remember seeing this as a child in the UK, fascinated by the story and Laurence Olivier's story. We didn't want to talk about anything else in school the next day. I imagine the ratings for the first view were huge. This is simply the best most comprehensive documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story down to the leg, they managed to catch as much. What is interesting is that the battles in Britain and North Africa were crucial, yet not recognized as such by the Americans. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, mistreatment of Japanese prisoners of war by US troops. The images of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, eternally guilty of the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not number one in the IMDb ranking. Maybe they show their bias against documentaries. Spoiler - we win.
