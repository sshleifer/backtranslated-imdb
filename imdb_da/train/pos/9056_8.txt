So we compromised. This was a pretty charming movie, I liked the art scene (it felt much more "right" than most kids movies), and the costumes were not for cutesy. The child's actors weren't bad to look at (the adult performances needed cheesy). It was good that they showed how a bullied child bully others as well as children who stand up for bullying. I do not know how many adults will see this for themselves, but it is a great movie to take a child to. And when "Barnyard" appeared to be attended by 100+ children at the same time, I'm really glad we chose the sparse "worms" present instead.
