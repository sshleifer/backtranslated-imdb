This Columbo episode is probably more noted for director Steven Spielberg, as one of his early films. It should be seen in Jack Cassidy's role as the killer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy wanted to be seen in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his fight in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mysterious writer who discovers the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general manager / widow who would extort him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to see Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's confidentiality as Columbo makes him aware after seeing this episode repeatedly over the years. What TV today forget about this year's success is that people will see the shows over and over again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it's Columbo's familiarness and his likeness, which scores high with viewers like myself.
