At first it looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Basic forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner and Oscar and BAFTA nominee Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo and one was brought together to revive their hospital chart for a TV show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is convinced that they can come together again without any difficult feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They can't come all the time, they're both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. Also starts Lee Meredith as a nurse in sketch, Carol DeLuise as wife Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Muppets from Space F. Murray Abraham as a mechanic. I think the best line in the movie is Burns, who mentions that Matthau called him "a son of a bitch bastard". It was nominated Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted from other material, it was nominated BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy and it was nominated for Best Manuscript. Very good!
