... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on a movie? This movie begins with a touch of Brazil ... when at some point the story moves right into the twilight ... nothing new behaves but just nothing ... and nothing is fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie is really fun ... jumping heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise of this year's FantasyFilmFest ... Like in Cube and Cypher Natali, this gave a minimalist, strange but much special design, which makes it hard to find history or time ... timeless in some way ...
