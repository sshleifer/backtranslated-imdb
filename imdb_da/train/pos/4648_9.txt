Hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant movie. Reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain - lots of weird characters who are joking about and looking for ..... what is it? I almost laughed all the way through, constantly keeping a peripheral eye on the confused and occasionally horrible reactions of the audience surrounding me in the theater. Entertaining through and through, from the beginning to the intestines and poisoned interventions all the way to the end if it was an end. I only wish I could remember every detail. It hangs me at times. <br /> <br /> Honestly, however, I have only the most positive memories of this movie. Since it does not seem to be available to go home and see, I have to assume that I will have to wait a few years until Crispin Glover returns with his Big Slide Show (and then "What is it ? "Screening) ... I saw this movie in Atlanta almost immediately after being involved in a rather devastating car accident, so I was a little dazed at that time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to see the prophetic talking arthropods and retarders in superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting, wisely dressed gifts that rise out of the floor like a magnificent DADAist wet dream. Is it a declaration of life as we know it? Of course, everyone understands that art is the same. Rather, I think the truth is more evident in absence and in the negative space. What you do not tell us is what we should derive, but it is far more valid than the lies that other people give us day and day out. Rather, a "WHAT IS IT?" than 5000 films such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle". (Shots, gag, moans). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (in addition, a fun man to watch on the screen or on his big slideshow - smart, fun, quirky and scary hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
