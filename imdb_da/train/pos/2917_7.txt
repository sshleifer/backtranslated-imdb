While this movie is not a classic of any stretch, it is very entertaining as I remember it. I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur", and even though it's not as fun as that movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon achieved with "Arthur".
