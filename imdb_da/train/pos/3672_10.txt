A mock documentary about a couple of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic book of their struggle to pull everything together despite a series of conflicting threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works like a movie in a way that looks very much like why this spinal tap (1984) works so well. Namely, even though it is exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and the truth is "behind the scenes" facts that are very different from the public face in the industry. It is not easy to make a movie, and it must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Movies involve tens if not hundreds of people. Many have incompatible wishes, motivations and personalities. Particularly crucial are the financiers and the talent on the screen as if they either fall out or become incessant at any time while the film is in production, it can endanger the whole matter, either necessitating extensive reshoots or completely abandoning the movie. <Br /> <br /> So, it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on such forms of relationships. The result is an excellent movie that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch. This is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a great interest in craftsmanship. It must also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor. A 10 out of 10 from me.
