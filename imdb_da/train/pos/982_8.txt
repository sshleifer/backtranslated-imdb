This is one of the westerns that stands almost alone in the effortless quality of its dialogue. Very few can stick to it over the long haul. That said, the rest is pretty bad. Nevertheless, I give it an eight because there is no other Western with such a consistent good dialogue with perhaps the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe a few more. <br /> <br /> It is riddled with weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore the most brilliant. But it has a truly memorable scene. Nothing like that. Its just after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elam's place trying to get him to a fight. Wonderful things. Right up with the best in any western.
