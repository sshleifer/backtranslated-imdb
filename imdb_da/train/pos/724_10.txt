The movie is simply fun .... maybe more fun for us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" around the time the movie was made. I've watched the movie over and over, alone and with friends, and it's still fresh and fun. With the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a particular band is timeless, and the school's upset of cramps by some classes is just as timeless. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some pearl lines / scenes ..... references to how our "permanent record" in high school follows us through life. (Let me assure you that I've been in high school for a few weeks and it doesn't follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I get some static" ..... "Not so much that you will get "as Principal Togar approaches. ... the scary board member who is so slow that he is present by nurses .... Nazi Hall Monitors love a "body search" ...... Principal Togar announces, "I'll give you the final solution" and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before the CDs) .... and of course Joey Ramone notes: "Things have probably changed since we were kicked out of high school", followed by Togar asking "Has your parents know you are Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Just a piece of advice ..... don't look up where stars are now ..... Joey Ramone died unfortunately young. Dey Young, who was a big hottie in the movie, reminds us that we are all aged .... PJ Soles career is never advanced as we might have expected ......... Marla Rosenfield, as a of the other students, apparently appeared only in this movie (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the movie), although I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her several teen roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So watch and enjoy ..... don't think .... just have fun!
