Holly deals with the issue of childhood propagation, which is fiercely worldwide (about 2 million children are smuggled every year) and makes it so sensitive and without manipulation - a high order made by the team at Priority Films with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the movie with novice Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress playing Holly, and together they bring on screen what is common to the people of the infamous k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Though it tackles a heavy subject, the film keeps moments of laughter and hope as we know the characters close to each other, as the two-hour movie stays to be too difficult to see. I'm glad a movie like this brings the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution must be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's big and a movie, everyone must see.
