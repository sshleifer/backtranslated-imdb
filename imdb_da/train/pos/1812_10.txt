This is one of the greatest movies ever, perhaps even the greatest movie ever. I had forgotten the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an add on TV to ADGTH and it brought back good memories of me seeing it when I was a young child. And when I saw it a couple of nights ago, I became dependent on the movie. Usually I don't like animated family movies, but this one is special, it's the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie always touches my heart and grieves me a lot, but that's what makes this movie great better than all the garbage cans that come out for kid movies today. I think the movie is G-rated, and it's about 2 dogs involved in games, there is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell depicted in the movie. Which I think makes the movie from good to big. I think movies today do not bring reality to children and in this movie they did. RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
