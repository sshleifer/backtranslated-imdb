Saw this movie twice in community screenings and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the movie really conquered some of the essence and taste of society - grin, determination, exhaustion, creativity, in your face with a dose of desperation. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid, and I have really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman Raya, as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. Great dance sequences, and it is not just the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera also moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multidimensional - no good or bad, and the women's characters are admirably strong. This is a movie that has a strong heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of young, hip hop and society like Jane Finch.
