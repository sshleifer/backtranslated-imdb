No other movie has made me feel like it before ... and I don't feel bad. I don't want my money back or the time I waited to watch this movie (9 months) and I also don't feel bad about spending two hours of sunny day to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how hard I hit my brain, I just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages ​​the movie helped to sum it up. I have no idea what was going on all the time and halfway through the movie, I needed a break. No movie has ever done it to me before. Never in my life have I liked cauliflower, milk and baguettes so much. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * clearing the neck * No words. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
