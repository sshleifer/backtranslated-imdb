It is true. The film is better than the book. Don't make me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just so much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I haven't seen Scatman Crothers and of course Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about them in my comment on the mini-series. But I missed a few. The film is shot at a better location than where the mini-series was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are frightening than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But expect to have nightmares every night for 3 weeks
