Things to come are really a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and progress. It makes some surprisingly accurate depictions of the war that were to follow a few years later, but are extremely naive in the utopian ideal. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are a fine cast, though the drama is more like a stage piece than a film work. There are grandiose if there are any stylish speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words there. Is technology the savior of mankind or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual celebration if one can detach from reality. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world of underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters and secret organizations of scientific saviors. It has all the possibilities for a sci-fi pulp adventure, but uses the place for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> Things to come to and Metropolis were the hallmarks of the neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operational in scope and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them, but their ideas are still leaping. There is an art scene there, one with more heart and feelings than the computer-generated mass-produced cinema today. These films are the products of craftsmen, not industrialists.
