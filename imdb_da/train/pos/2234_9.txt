While the "special effects" and technical features of this movie may be ridiculous for some, I have never been able to delete the pictures of this movie etched on my young and impressive mind when I first saw it about 8 years. The story of this girl's survival and the trials she has shown have stayed with me these years and I've been thinking more than once about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything I've seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story and that I was only a child when I first saw it may be the reason for my high rating of this movie. Every time this movie was broadcast on television in the 70s and 80s, I would be ridden for television and drinking in every scene of interest I can't explain. I suppose to see this for the first time as an adult (and with a combed view of the world) it may not be so much fun for some. I actually went out of my way to get a copy so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other films, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories, partly for Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I think you can enjoy this movie as much as I have had in the last 30 years.
