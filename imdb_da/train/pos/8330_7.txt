What a lovely little tree ?? a very competent film that has so much charm and an emotional factor that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein appears brilliantly by Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable ?? better than I've seen her in the movies towards Tom Hanks ?? as the young mathematician struggles to be recognized. You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic to her immediately, and as a young man it is easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There is universal appeal in these feelings, though I.Q. keeps it all light, fun and bound fine. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not heavy, but if you see there are some subtitles. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his proverb as something like 'if it is not impossible, why do it?' suggests that he is a believer in achieving higher goals beyond one's immediate understanding. In this movie, there are questions about what an accident really is? As if Albert and his whacky sidekicks' interventions on curious Catherine away from stiff upper lip, beloved James (Stephen Fry? who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you can't help but feel his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention does our life take that we do not see and come across as serendipitous? <br /> <br /> Of course, we want to think in real life, despite what we often observe of the people we know we Edwards are getting Catherine's and Jameses to learn to defrost ice water in their veins. How nice to know that it can work in I.Q.'s innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower era.
