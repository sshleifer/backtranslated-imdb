I'm constantly watching this movie. I've seen it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. It is great for those who love comedy films, tower films or even pets. The music is wonderful, the animals are spectacular, the scenes really well thought out and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters are the true and nicely mixed personalities: Shadow (the oldest, a Golden Retriever) He is the wise, full of wisdom and mindset for any dog. Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.
