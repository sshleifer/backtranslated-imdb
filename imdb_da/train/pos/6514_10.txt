I thought the kids in the show did a very good job. I especially enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Well done! The stunter was pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to watch the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the toothpick and the burning of her. The ghostly notions of children's souls that were released were also good. Another good point in the movie is that it continued to move together. There were not many slow scenes. The adult driver was also trustworthy and therefore helped keep the show entertaining. All in all, an enjoyable night watching movies.
