This is a collection of documentaries that last for 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists worldwide. The documentary files are varied and deal with all possible concepts. The only thing that is shared is 9/11 as a theme (much less in some cases). Some of the segments are weak, while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are only around 9/11; some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch human emotions, feelings and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been censored in any way by anyone so that the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think that two segments might be crossed from the right wing (one from Egypt, where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits, another from the UK, telling the US-backed overthrow of Chile on September 11 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, telling the tower's fall and the resulting death in a lively way (you have to see it to believe it). Although the final product is uneven, with some segments almost "meaningless", I still recommend this. It is very difficult to rank this movie because the segments vary everywhere (some weak, some very powerful;). I give this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
