"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely talked about. The movie is only available in a low quality VHS format. It's a pity that this movie hasn't got a DVD release. "Erendira" is amazing and beautiful with its magical realistic images. "Erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Loneliness". Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burning down on her grandmother's house. Her wicked grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her into prostitution to pay for the damage. The whole town gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the subject sounds loud, the film does not exploit sexuality. It is done in a mature artistic way. The film also has some fantastic costumes. Some of the more surrealistic aspects of the movie that stand out most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the middle. Erendira is a great movie that even manages to throw in humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD release. As they would say in espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
