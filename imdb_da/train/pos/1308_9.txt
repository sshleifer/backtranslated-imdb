I must say that I really had no idea that I should sit down and watch this movie. I think it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between the class. But for once, a television movie got my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really wasn't a big fan of her before this movie. Sure, I liked Twister and as good as it gets. But something about this movie really did it for me. I will now see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with high marks from ... me. Give it a try, it won't let you down.
