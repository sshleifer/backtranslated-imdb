This movie describes the life of a person who grew up in the worst cases, but unlike many people, he actually grew up to be a respectable person. What's more, this is a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent, yet he was mistreated just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years, and he has never been fooled by women, cola, cigars, weeds, alcohol or any of the things that are very popular in the places he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about this movie, it is excellent. The only rating I can give is a 10/10.
