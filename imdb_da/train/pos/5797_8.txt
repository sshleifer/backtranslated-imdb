And I'm not saying it in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins, it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew he had no idea. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I watched this movie that was released a few times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring that sense of magic back and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I only watched this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to see it again. If I saw it today, I know I couldn't help criticizing MJ's action, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings about it are those in a child from 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult himself going into my rating and giving it an 8 for memories and wonderful music. For the little child who saw it in awe 20 years ago, but it's definitely worth a 10.
