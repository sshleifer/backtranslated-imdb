I can't quite understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" over political reasons. No, the film did not investigate both sides of the story, but then a movie in favor of Chavez against the tide of propaganda against him must be seen as an attempt to balance the narrative in general (especially given the history of CIA involvement in Latin America in fermentation of civilian uro - google National Security Archive and B. coverage in this country and elsewhere in the clear phony scenes of Chavez support shooting non-existent opponents. The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that the filmmakers were in the presidential palace all the way, though the coup - surely a first in documentary production - pictures of a coup from both sides !!!
