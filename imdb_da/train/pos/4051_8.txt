Eric Rohmers "The Lady and the Duke". could have used a better translation for the title. "The English woman and the Duke" might have been more precise. Although it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments made on this forum, it is worth looking at because Mr Rohmer has made a film that could be seen as an art exhibition in an intricate pattern of history. museum. The mixed technology used in the film ultimately works well. <br /> <br /> The weird story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who had been the French king of England and the French Duc d'Orleans, keeps our attention. The setting is Paris in the days that followed the French Revolution. The country was in turmoil and power was in people's hands, which could not fit less for the aristocrats. The pictures show that the agitators run around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the guillotine. The Grace relationship with the Duc was completed, but she remains a true friend to the big man who is in danger even losing his own head. Grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able to escape. She even has an enemy in her own house, in the form of the chef, Pulcherie, who would not hesitate to condemn her at least provocation. <br /> <br /> Watching the movies at times, the viewer gives the impression you are walking through the Louvre and looks at the great canvases depicting this crucial era in French history. Instead of finding the digitizing process distracting, we found it to improve the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, does a good job of portraying this woman so much during her lifetime. Her French seems to be excellent as it seems she is fluent in it. Like Duc d'Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution that made us believe that he is the nobleman himself without any effort. The support molding was also great. As an ensemble piece, Mr. Rohmer good performances around. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, "Lady and the Duke" will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
