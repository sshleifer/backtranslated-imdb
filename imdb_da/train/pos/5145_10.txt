<br /> <br /> An old man works as a vicar at a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is patient there and to try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a wonder of Japanese cinema history. Long thought lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack that was added to what fits perfectly with the pictures. It could have been influenced by Dr. Caligary's cabinet (director Kinugasa claimed he never saw the German film). But it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing (and cool) depiction of the inner mental state of the asylum-inmates. To achieve this, the film makes use of every single film technique available at that time: multiple exposures and out-of-focus view, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist illumination, and overlays among others. It is also a very complicated movie to follow as it does not have text. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a montage of rain showers that hit the windows in the hospital, wind shaking trees and thunder. The disturbing weather metaphorizes the mental state of the patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder acts as the music that encourages the dancer to enter a hectic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient involved in another frenzied dance, she is monitored by other inmates. Several exposures of the dancer represent the patients' point of view and their confused "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples from this amazing movie that attempt to represent the patients' subconscious and vision of the "sane" world. <br /> <br /> In three words A MUST SEE.
