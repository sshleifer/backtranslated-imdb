This is an incredible movie. I can't remember the last time I saw a Swedish film this layered. It's fun, it's tragic, it's convincing, and most of all it's a piece of Swedish little city life. It crushes the cliches and lives deeper. It makes you feel connected, not just to the main characters, but to all the characters. <br /> <br /> Her big-city tracks back to her roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she hasn't met for years. Although the story itself is not unique, it gives a fresh approach. The center of history is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life) that are not very close. Or at least not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> An important reason that makes it so easy to connect with the people in this movie is the immaculate cast. First, I am more than happy with the fact that there are absolutely no so-called 'A-list' Swedish actors in this movie. Usually there are a handful of players who have the ability to find their way in almost any major production in Sweden. This time, the manufacturing company managed to keep it right by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva RÃ¶se to prove that you do not need words to convey a feeling. Scripture is also very appealing. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films from the previous year or two, it is forward for miles. Maria Blom manages everything from the start, and if you didn't know, you would never guess that this is her first time writing and leading a movie of her own length. I can't wait for her next. <br /> <br /> As you begin to see this, you'll really see it through.
