"Pandora's Clock" is a gripping thrill / thriller that is a cross between a virus movie and a disaster movie. This film, which was broadcast in two on NBC's 1996 debut, is about a flight being infected by a virus when one of the passengers is just carrying this disease. The US government is debating whether or not the plane should be destroyed while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure out something to avoid disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked "Pandora's watch". It is a heck of an exciting trip. Jane Leeves (TV's "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also star. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
