A must see for anyone who loves photography. fantastic and breathtaking, leaving you in ore. seen it twice once in a movie theater and now on DVD. It does well on DVD, but on the big screen it was something else. <br /> <br /> Took my two daughters to see this, and they loved it, my eldest cried at the end. But she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it in the video store. Its simple tale of a child's love for nature and especially a fox is well-known. In some ways it reminded me of the bear in telling a story not documentary. that works very well for children. Not being preached to it is very important, you make your own mind up. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie is the cinematographers, how did they do what they did. fantastic just amazing.
