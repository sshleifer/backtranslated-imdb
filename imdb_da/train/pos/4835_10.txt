It is a story of Siberian village people from the early 20th century to the 60s. It's about passion and emotion, about Russian soul and very romantic. This movie is NOT action packed, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find good songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made for example. Runaway Train.
