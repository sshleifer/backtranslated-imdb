This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very much affected by the theme the film intends to convey. One phrase that continues to come up with me is that "history repeats itself". Life is what it is shown in the movie: When people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have every excuse not to share the dearest time with their children until they are too late; people must always work hard to support the whole family, but are only responsible for neglecting the delicate sense of their partners; People change their perspectives always at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their loved ones; Nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and one is never too late to talk to their people about what they feel at the bottom of their heart to gain a better understanding between them, so that when life has To end a day, people must not feel deplorable or enchanting as they have kept their words and there is always hope --- a new life. The actors and actors are amazing. They have understood the director's intent perfectly. The film's charm lies in, for me, the effect of bringing a talented and fantastic fusion of toast and tears to the audience.
