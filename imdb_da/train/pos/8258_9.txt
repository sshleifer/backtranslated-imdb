At a risk of sounding a bit sacrilegious, at first view, I am so inclined to put this all on the level of 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, considering that I see Simon Pegg as a undoubtedly comedy genius, I realize it's a pretty big requirement. And to what extent you agree with the last statement can be a good preliminary measure of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> In a way, the comedy comes up where 'Shaun' relaxes, except we are back in the original 1950s Living Dead era stereotypical Central American small town. Zombie Wars is over and zombies themselves become more well-adjusted, useful members of society. This, so that we are oriented from the start, is largely due to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a great game about romantic comedy perhaps? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie lies in its death-pan depiction of a respectable neighborhood that maintains core values ​​while creating space for zombies and the particular dangers they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is almost perfect. Themes that you can expect from a more common kitsch comedy come through - good life, clean appearances, suppressed emotions, confused parenting, social decorations, and the alienated person's situation. <br /> <br /> It is a story told with merry heart and broad appeal, vividly made by the film's all-round strong cast. It is one of those works where it really shows that everyone involved got a kick out of participating. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly teaches his script to be like ... So in conclusion, you're likely to appreciate humor in this movie unless your father tried to eat you.
