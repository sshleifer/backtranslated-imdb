This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. But I think men all over the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some extent! These thoughts are very entertaining, and women will also enjoy this movie, I'm sure! All cast members are doing well, and this movie could have been a huge hit all over the world if it was made in England or the United States. But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish, you are in love! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
