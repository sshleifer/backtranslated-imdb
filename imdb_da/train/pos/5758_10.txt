This, in my opinion, is one of the best action movies from the 1970s. It not only has a great cast but is also filled with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about the fact that a Vietnamese veterinarian (Kris Kristofferson) is recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town, and what happens when Kris begins to exploit his position And being as bad as criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Kris play against type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer great support as the respective ladies in the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star persona in this movie. I don't think the Vigilante Force is on video, but it occasionally appears on television. It's a good flick for guys who like movies.
