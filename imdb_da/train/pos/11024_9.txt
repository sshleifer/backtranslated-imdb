This movie is just amazing. It's entertaining from the beginning to the end, you'll always sit on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this film is highly underestimated by the critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of well-educated mountain rescuer Gabe Walker. Along with him, Michael Rooker makes a good appearance as Hal Tucker. And then John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen on him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place on a mountain with many bad guys on it makes room for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movies!
