Okay, so it comes a few weeks late, but this is here. This is mostly due to statements made by various negative natures. Starting with the technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, special power technology was extremely low tec, and more than that, the crew had some money to do any kind of real mock ups. In the 35 years when the TOS was premiered, the crew of Star Trek has become economics experts. Ultimately, they have quite rightly decided to abandon the look of TOS and reverse engineered TNG et al. So what if they decided not to make the carrier out of gold glitter or made the phase guns closer to them from Star Trek II? Regarding the nits chosen for first contact with the Klingon Empire, it is believed to be based on comments from Kirk and Riker that Earth only met Klingons in 2200. Nothing was fixed. <br /> <br /> The company is giving us the most promising place for exploration that we have seen for some time. This may have been Voyager. No series can develop without a few inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so few. So stop grabbing and enjoying.
