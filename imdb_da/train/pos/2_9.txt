Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. The expert script and perfectly delivered, this sharp parody of students and teachers at a public school in South London literally leaves you rolling with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are an excellent caricature cross-section of British society (or, to be more precise, of any society). After the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" to have a better expression, the show does not shade from parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out of the window of each episode. If you enjoy shows that are not afraid to poke fun of every taboo topic, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
