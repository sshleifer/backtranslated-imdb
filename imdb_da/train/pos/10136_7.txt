This is one of the best episodes from the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills them all, they are often victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I can't remember Argento's episode in season 1, etc., of course Imprint). I think he enjoys seeing that women have been burned, tortured, mutilated, and I don't know. Never at least "Right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and excitement (especially with photos from the cell scene, wonderful). The action is like the whole series, regularly I can be worst as "Pro-life" or "We scream for Ice". Also I think the plot could be made into a movie and not just for an episode. The series's ideology is horrible, killing and closing women, mutilated animals and over and over again. The first season was better than the other with episodes such as "Cigarrette burns" ("Better of all") "Homecoming" (The Most Fun), "Imprint" (really shocking).
