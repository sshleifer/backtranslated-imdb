Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! The music is everywhere, and also shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, all colorless to entertain only. Clean cinema essentially. A wonderful experience to see. And one is especially grateful as good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, it is one, and if you enjoy Kusturica's earlier films, you will love this, even if it is a chemical reaction in all comedies, and you have to be in the mood for it.
