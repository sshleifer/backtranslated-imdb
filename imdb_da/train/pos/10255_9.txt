This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems to be realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is false. The story is about a woman who was caught and tortured in many different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it contains a manga video showing the torture. The men who catch her test the limits of a human being before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as The eye club scene and others are not shocking as the girl is beaten 100 times because you see battles in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of fun, so I would recommend this to people 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
