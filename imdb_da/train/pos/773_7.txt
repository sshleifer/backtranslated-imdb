I expected something else: more passion, drama ... Yet another unsuccessful attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the movie falls into the old clich√© of 'cheesiness'.15 year old teenagers can appreciate it themselves. not very convincing and the lines common, missing something. On the other hand, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can't say that this movie is a total flop because people see it, but it doesn't meet the public's expectations and lowered to mediocrity. So to conclude, production keeps you in front of the television for almost an hour and a half, which is a noticeable thing. So I think it's worth seeing if you don't get annoyed
