"Someone on the door". OHHH, How I miss this show so bad .. but we are lucky to have now "Invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had it all. If I were to pick a thing that I liked best about the show, it should be its "unpredictable plot lines". Favorite actress was Lucas Black .. I love the southern accent. I bought the DVD and my kids are also fans. There are some hot n steamy scenes. Some Devilish too. So if kiddos want to watch, you might want to edit (fast forward / skip). It has humor, at a Joss Wheedon level, so many shows are missing. Adult adult and adult situation handled with finese. The DVD has some extra features, but I want it to have many more. If you want to be excited and enjoy a good show, come and see "American Gothic"!
