A whole, this movie is not perfect. It is not well connected, as history is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a little 'for 80' and tend to dance the picture. </ br> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that a movie has something special when you and your friends still refer to stupid quotes from it over two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are also a bunch of known faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles in Alan Hale Jr., skipper from Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> There are also some amazing absurdist moments that reach Johnny's puppies with a prize pistol or the pope's appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. Also the scene where the false priest makes a lot of words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too loud ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney, who beats the English language Danny Devito and calls on Griffin Dunne for 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinks he lost his crew The fake VD movie <br /> <br /> This movie is not home . But as 'Porky's', it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
