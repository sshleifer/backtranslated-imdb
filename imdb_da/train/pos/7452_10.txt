I'm a big fan of a Faerie Tale Theater, and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's fun, romantic and a classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's good for young children because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it's fun and not over the top. I saw it when I was a kid, and I still see it now. It has big lines that my family and I quote all the time. The action is great and it never gets old. If you like adventure and romance, you will love this. I've seen many Cinderella movies in my time, and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theater shows. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.
