I've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. This should be a cult fair! The best line, "Your dress is deeply cool!" says the prince to cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a boardmate. I also like the 1950s and motorcycles. The melancholy prince is a great deviation from the typical swashbuckler. He tries to remain cool, but fails to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess-to-be. Her slippers are not glass (threatening to the original story), but Cinderella loses anyway, but gets it back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it doesn't appear anymore and seems to be almost impossible to get. Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will begin to stock this one soon.
