I'm surprised no one has thought of making a movie like this before. Horror is often most effective when it uses reality discomfort as a theme. And no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Dental tours have been done before (see Marathan Man for example), but it brings the terror to suburbia. The plot is about a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who falls into madness. Now, our dear doctor did not start playing with a full tire at first, but driven by jealousy and a compulsive disorder, he began to throw chaos on them around him. The doctors spiraling mental state is a bit close to what we see in Micheal Douglas's character in Falling Down, but with a horror edge. Written and directed by horror stalwarts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, it is witty and has a great flow. Also emphasized playing a policeman is the always welcome Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now, I think this movie wouldn't work without the amazing performance of Corbin Bernsen. Having only seen him in LA Law before, I was blown away by his acting. <br /> <br /> The sequel Dentist 2 is also worth looking at, but slightly below par compared to the original. <br /> TTKK's bottom line - A fun movie with some scenes that make you hug, shortened (word play) with a great performance from Bernsen
