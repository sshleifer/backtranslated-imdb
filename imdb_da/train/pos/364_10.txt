Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's popular novel is not without its part of the controversy. When the first published members of the black community criticized its treatment of black men while others asked why a white man led this movie about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children of her battered father, who moves from her arms at birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in recent years by beginner Whoopie Goldberg) is married to a fierce man (Danny Glover). The man is humiliated by her sister, so she is quickly removed from Celie's life. The story is often heartbreaking when Celie stops hoping that one day she will be reunited with her sister and with her children. Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a hard nail wife to her stepson and Shug, a tall and sweet saloon singer who teaches her one or two things about love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction is this whole picture, which offers brilliant filmography and some stellar performances. I dare to watch this movie and not move! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. While it tends to minimize the lesbian aspects as well as the African history, which were so alive in the book, the movie is still true to its themes, so Alice Walker's voice shines through. <br /> <br /> I couldn't begin to react to the controversy surrounding this movie. Suffice it to say that this is one of the few movies I can see over and over again and has left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
