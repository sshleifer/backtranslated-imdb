Perhaps it is me and my perverted ways, or the fact that I have a very sick mind, but I rented this movie randomly a very weird night and to my great surprise, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured I was prepared for everything it would offer. I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything to cut a long story short. I can see why it was banned, not just for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality. <br /> <br /> Of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the animal, a personal favorite of mine, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening of a dream that a duchess is being chased by one scary-it-thing-like-like animals with a huge erection and a considerable amount of ejaculation. Of course, the animal gets what he wants and the duchess decides that she likes it, and they continue to flirt in the forest. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there is so much more! <br /> <br /> Not only do we see interspecial sex, but there are also humping horses, the babysitter coming down and dirty with the slave when she doesn't bump the bed to get her ... is ... satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbates with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and comfortable, but it took a while for my dad to talk to me again after he saw it after I went to bed ... I was 15. Word of advice when I watched this movie: make sure you are the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed. It can be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like this one.
