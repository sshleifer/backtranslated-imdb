This is a movie that the regular market is unlikely to ever access, as it does not easily allow the viewer to see. The story of troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but it has its own unique edge and I found it entertaining. There are moments glimpse when the film was shot at such a low budget as when Spike inhales the aerosol. But I didn't really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the movie trying to make it. And also I did not like that most of the film is used with the two friends who talk and not really much "action". It's a small movie that's complex to see, and that's what makes it appealing.
