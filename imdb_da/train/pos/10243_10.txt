It's good, I loved it because I love dinosaurs, they are the biggest animals, but I loved the show because it was not copied from another show and it was originals. It has a good story and great for young children (if they like dinosaurs it is) I have a few downs, because it is not so big cause for the dinosaurs, look a little mutated, so I should have had but a 7, but just now it is a little late for it yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this can ruin a part for you so if you dont want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is a little weird cause all they have to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm dont guess a spoiler so remember i loved it and that is my opinion and sorry for any missing spelling words if any
