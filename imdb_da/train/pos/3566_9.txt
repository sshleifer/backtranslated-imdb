In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had not yet reinvented on the silver screen. But Sinatra's account as former Nathan Detroit helped restore Sinatra with his fans. It's a great screen version of a great game, and the choices of managers and support players are amazing. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his only song role that he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, the woman's leaders, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (who plays her stage role as Nathan's long-suffering boyfriend Adelade), put superlative bets. Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (as nicely nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no version of Rockin 'The Boat even comes close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who would be known as the television producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, make "Harry The Horse" wonders, BSPulley is excellent as the hard way and rough talk "Big Julie" and even Regis Toomey offers its expertise as "Brother Wife". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun musicals to watch, good comedy and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck be a woman tonight" and brother ... "it's your dice"
