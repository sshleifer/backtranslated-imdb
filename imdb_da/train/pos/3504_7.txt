This movie feels like a movie project. As if the filmmakers chose a cross-section of society without experience and came to work. However, signs are kind of uninitiated and naive. Despite this amateur feeling, the movie is effective. It is like a cross section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or care for their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grandparent, of course from that generation, is shameful about sexuality. This allows for some predictable but well-executed conflicts. Probably most pleasant was the way in which the protagonist grew slightly in his romantic relationship and realized a greater depth of sexual feelings. A good watch but no stirring ....
