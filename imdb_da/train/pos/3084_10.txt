Oh man, why? "Six degrees" is a show of this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this show, it was not my attention at all. It seemed too common indeed. Then I saw some episodes ... and loved it! First of all, the signs. They are all well-written and different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose fianc√©e cheats on her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a restless brother and so on. Contrary to what we are used to, most of the characters interact with each other in accidents, as in our daily routines. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> So cast. They are all good. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", shows here his actions in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton. The others also give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan who play Whitney. <br /> <br /> When I got to IMDb, I couldn't believe that after seeing some episodes was canceled. Seriously, I can't understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's too bad it didn't have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
