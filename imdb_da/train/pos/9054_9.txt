"October Sky" is a movie that steals your heart, fills your mind with moving images and lifts your spirit. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seems so simple in the beginning, especially when the film is set in a mining operation, where the future is just as carved as the ball of the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff and his friends, Homer tries to make his dream a reality. But as in any sand for life story there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, witnessing the chilling events of the memorials bent beneath a ceiling on rock. With lit helmets and bent body posture, the alien insectoids looked more like people in the dark. The miners' hacking coughs and the black faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners face in their work. <br /> <br /> Contrasting the minuscule's head load is the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Under the blue bowl of heaven, rockets are placed on a pillow and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. But what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. Love and support from Miss Riley is also evident. Best of all, the movie is uncomfortable. It doesn't all tie in a nice bow. It tears you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered a complete work. First, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what a good movie does for a person. If it has done its job, you will not end it. And "October Sky" achieves just that.
