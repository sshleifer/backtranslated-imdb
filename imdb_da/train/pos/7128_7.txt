It's undoubtedly John Thaw's finest performance, with which he successfully shakes some features of his Inspector Morse character and brings a perfect fit of Tom from the sides of the book to the TV screen. This is a well-produced production that maintains its family view, despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> But it's the relationship between Tom and Young Willie, who is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from London and the grinning old man he is left with developing - a real grandfather / grandson. It is a pity that this story was not made with a larger budget with a more established director, as it belongs on the big screen, not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Because of the right guidance, John Thaw will be celebrated worldwide and donated with many awards for his amazing performance in this movie. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at that time.
