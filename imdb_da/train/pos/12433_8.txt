This is a good movie, although people who are not familiar with the Modesty Blaise comics and books can find it a bit slow and lacking in action. For the Modesty tab, the movie will be very entertaining, especially because it is very faithful in its presentation of Modesty Blaise "History". Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credit as "Creative Consultant", and the filmmakers must have paid particular attention to it as the plot follows the details presented in the comics over the years, although the events have been reworking into modern days. The only thing that the true fan can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in history. This lack of Willie is again just true to the Modesty Blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of Modesty's career. The Alexandra City makes a very credible young Modesty who actually looks a lot like Modesty should see. A welcome change from the travesty of Monica Vitti depiction of Modesty.
