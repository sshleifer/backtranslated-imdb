A beautiful shopwoman in London is swept off the feet of a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and lives with him at his British Ceylon villa. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this original line-up is very similar to Hitchock's "Rebecca", with the leading lady Elizabeth Taylor clashing with the impressive Chief of Staff at the Manor and (almost immediately) her own husband who is still the thumb of his late-but-dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute replacement for a scary Vivien Leigh, looks slick in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; But when the man Peter Finch begins to drink strong and bend orders with her, one might believe that her dedication to him is rather masochistic (this feeling inhibits the ending too). Still, the film gives a gentle party to soap buffets: romantic drama, a bit of travelogue, interpretation dance, an elephant stomp and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera! *** from ****
