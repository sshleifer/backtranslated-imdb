This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I watched this movie for the first time a week ago since every day I see the opening, and every time I feel so excited as I felt the first time I heard David Niven pronounce the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's Pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Give me my scallop of peace, My faithful staff to walk on, my joy of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My dress of glory, the true gage of hope; And then I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressuburgers life is thoroughly justified in having created such a wonderful opening? Because they were already in the Poets Paradise long before they made this film. I imagine they both face the trial during the judgment day and say nonchalantly to an Irish God: I beg your apology, sir. Then you know what we have done during our life? Well you want to see: We have written directed and produced: I know where I go, Colonel blimp, red shoes ?? Do you think sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with God, the Nature Mouse, or whatever you might call it, as they shot the questions of a life and death. That other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could not be clear to everyone, even though I feel my life would have a meaning, I would never have done anything else to watch this movie. Of course, old timers will be tempted to say: they don't make movies like this anymore. They are partially confused; They haven't made movies like this in the last few times either. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats here, but I repeat his words: A beauty is a joy forever.
