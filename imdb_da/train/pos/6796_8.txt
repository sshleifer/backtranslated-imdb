Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film from German born director Ulli Lommel. He leads, produces and co-stars in this latest production. Not only does it make an interesting movie on the cheap. But he reaches a new low when Herr Lommel works in recordings from almost his entire movie catalog. I have watched movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Wolf's Tenderness, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a como beyond the grave courtesy of this movie). Although he uses lots of old footage, he works well (and I can add very creatively). <br /> <br /> The movie follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. He also responds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer at the end of sixty and early 70s. The author's friend (David Hess) helps him to find this wannabe Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the author put two and two together and regain some of his old glory? Is David Hess still the man? You have to find out for yourself and see the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about the original Zodiac kittens. I've also heard people whining that this movie is being shot on video. So what. The director's old school artistic style distinguishes the fact that it's shot on video. My only complaint was the transient use of stock footage from Mr Lommel's previous film (but I understand why "blink" "blink".) Don't believe the hype. This is a greedy and street-level horror movie. Like the disclaimer in the early states, this film also does not glorify murder. You may have this statement. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
