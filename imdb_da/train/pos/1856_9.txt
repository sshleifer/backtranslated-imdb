He glorified himself as a great supportive actor in `Glory ', he proved that he was not' Malcolm in the middle 'mediocre actor in' Malcolm X ', he showed his brotherly love to appear in' Philadelphia ', he drew a slamdunk in `He got games ', he took no blows and rocked us like a hurricane in` The Hurricane', he gave us an effective thespian training in 'Training Day' and now he has shown that he could also lead! Denzel Washington's direct debut `Antwone Fisher 'is this year's most moving film. This tearjerks' fisher story is not related to the debate that took place with the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the final game of the 2002 season. Unlike this Dolphin tragedy, "Antwone Fisher" has an emotionally happy conclusion. The film is based on a true story of a young naval officer who has an angry management problem because of the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the sought-after psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convince him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable spectacle I have seen of a beginner actor for some time now. In fact, I saw some of the detailed eccentrics in Luke's play that I have seen in Washington's earlier performances. It was as if Washington was telling Luke-la la la Luke, I'm your actor. Okay! I will deliver the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far away. Talking about the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting 'Master D' yourself. "Antwone Fisher" was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional patches he put into his story movie were of "fisher king" material. I hail to the boss `Mr. Washington 'catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Excellent
