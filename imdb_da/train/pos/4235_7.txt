.... after 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! Whatever happened to Old Burton, who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as research for his preparation for leading Batman back in 1988-89? Burton didn't investigate the book or movie because he got everything wrong! This movie sucks! It's not as good as the original, and it's not about the same subject as the original. If you want a good monkey film look the original. <br /> <br /> ** out of **** stars
