<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the second night. I have been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since I came out of high school. I didn't grow up on this movie ... maybe my mom kept me away from it. It is certainly not for children. Not that it is bad in the graphic sense, but that the themes would go just above most 10-year-old heads. All in all, the animation was excellent as this was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book pretty well in loose sense. But I'm bothered that Bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and thanks to the Return of the King parts. It would have made it the ultimate movie. I was bothered by the sudden end and when I heard the Return of the King sucked, I was even more bothered. Too bad it wasn't a big animation movie. It could have got a higher voice from me. I give it a 7. I can only hope Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR.
