Page 3 is definitely a very enchanting and captivating eye-opener, very cleverly exhibiting the hypocrite's lifestyle in Mumbai's elite. From the false kisses to the plastered smiles, no stone leaves unchanged in revealing the appalling lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal snakes in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert of this world, where social Darwinism is the dominant mentality. Everyone is constantly in demand for more money, more fame, and a higher reputation driving them to do the most shameful things that can be imagined from signing a movie treaty at a funeral for child crimes. Everything is possible in this big city where there is such a big gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugly of both these classes through the main character's eyes. She observes the stifling atmosphere and the enchanting frenzy that the socialites live in. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians and the underworld are all intertwined in a terrible mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track, like the naughty Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Great movie with excellent character development!
