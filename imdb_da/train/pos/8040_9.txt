This will be a little short. Don't listen first to the critics as it is not as bad as most people say it is !! Snipers use a classic movie formula that many reject immediately as the flawing movie. While snipers do not fully reflect the truth of how our country's snipers work, it gives those who know nothing about professional snipers a glimpse of the sniper's world. And yes, the movie has many errors, but which movie doesn't it? There are many good scenes and good plays by Tom Berenger. I must say that the two worst scenes are at the start of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine's bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposite force sweeping it !! There are also lots of good shots from the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as if you are looking through a rifle head. And yes, the Sniper Motto is `one shot, one kill '. Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
