I remember watching this movie when it first came out in 1982 and then loved it. About 4 years later I had the privilege to see Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca), so seeing the end of this movie reminds me a lot about the big night. What doesn't you like about this movie? The music is brilliant, and the Pavarotti (Fini) was the best and still so great. The story is actually a lot of fun in parts and the 'food match' scene is still one of the most fun I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful and so was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And hear the dove of Santa Lucia beautiful. Get real people, this was a movie about an opera singer called Georgio Fini, who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supportive roles. I am very happy that I still have this almost worn VHS tape of this movie, but I would love this to be released on DVD, especially now Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes Nessun Dorma's best priest he still sold on film today!
