This movie is a great one. The plot is very true to the book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called "when you stump your toe on the moon" It reminds me of Sinatra song High Hopes, it's fun and inspiring. The music is amazing all the time, and my favorite song is sung by King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a fantastic date movie. This is a movie you can see over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye in Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie.
