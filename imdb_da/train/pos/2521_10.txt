I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and a * big * fan of Hyde. I had expected a good movie with many shots, as we should say, pleasing to the feminine eye, but a little cheesy story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded out there. And now that I've just finished seeing it, I feel the need to tell the world its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heartbreaking performances, and my eyes are still warm from the cry that lasted throughout the last half of the film. You get sucked into the story and you really feel the characters at the end. Vampyrism's element - which I love, but it is very easy to exaggerate or destroy a movie - blends subtly into the big line so it just makes it exotic, usually for this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. I ranked it on a 9 out of 10 first ... and then I went back and tried to think why I didn't give the last point. Come up with nothing. So a ten out of ten is it. After all - I'm not much critic - the fact that I'm bothering to write a review at all, I either really hate the movie or really love it. You can see which side I am with Moon Child.
