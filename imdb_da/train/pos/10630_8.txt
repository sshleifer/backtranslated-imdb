I think it is unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words "Clueless and appalling nonsense." I think it's a very fun movie and great entertainment. One must suspend his disbelief that a gay man and a lesbian woman could fall in love, have a child, and live together happily ever. But it's always great to watch it play in a movie and get its heart warmed. Is that so impossible? There are far more incredible events described in other films. The action is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment is that the story might well have ended when the family drives away from its original house instead of stretching to investigate whether the man retains any remaining homosexuality.
