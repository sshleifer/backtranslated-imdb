Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The bottom of the triangle is barely there. At the top is Marie, a serious, short and lean tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby - I dare say fat - and wants her first kiss with a boy, but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her chubbiness, boys do not seem interested and that makes it painful. <br /> <br /> The other leg at the top is a beautiful "rag fatal" blonde vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming, which performs at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie seeps into the life of the vamp by the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has a reputation for being a whore that does out with any young man who orbits her. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. Put stress on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is created. We get to see very synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls. Finally, the story tells synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy-turvy relationships between the three. This is when unexpected things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films that release the nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This is no exception. Here it is about ceilings and dying. Watch the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says the use of synchronized swimming is targeted. The fact that women alone sports is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface, while it is hard-working and competitive underneath. A number of scenes run this point: elegant movements and smiles for the public, legs kicking ungainly underwater. The title of French is also suggestive: "prieuve" or squid, suggests a person to juggle many prints simultaneously.
