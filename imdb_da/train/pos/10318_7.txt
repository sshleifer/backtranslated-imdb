It has said that movies and baseball both thrived during the Great Depression. It seems that the naked realities of a nation trapped in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary escape could be found in the continuing soap opera, which is Baseball. Also an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours in the cinema's dark auditoriums. The presence of a radio in almost everyone's household kept depression time America tuned to the world's events and gave many a drama and (especially) comedy programs to a comfortable interlude from the harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of the time also flourished at all levels. The juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic did not appear magical, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all in itself. There were media that were their ancestors. The open comic book was, of course, a parent who gave the visual / narrative method of narration. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was the mass magazine. The cheap prose history publications that started many stories of the same fairy-tale characters, but not necessarily serialized, stories. The mass media had been around for decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO. The 1930s produced a buffer crop as character figures like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8'S BATTLE ACES and SPIDER, MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news among many others. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a full blooded superhero in the written story; The tires on the pulse might have the only "picture" of the hero. Doc was the Super Hero prototype. He also collects 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free launch team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a given field. So we had the highest grade: Chemist, Lawyer, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineering, Geologist-Archaeologist-Paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were published in in the mid 50s. Then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. Then the brainstorm came to repackage the old novels in a new "container", the paper book. A new look for cover art was introduced with a highly stylized series of paintings by a very muscular Doc with an eternally torn shirt. <br /> <br /> The reintroduction proved to be very successful with the publication of a title every month (and a while longer). Soon there was rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by which manufacturer? Well, the venerable "Man of Bronze" was back on the news for over 10 years before a real project was put together. It was the veteran Stop-Action Animator and Producer of Top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who made the film with Warner Brothers. When DOC SAVAGE, BRONZE MAN, arrived in Movie Houses, it boasted of a well-cast team of actors, albeit in virtually "No Name" so much knowledge of viewers. With former Tarzan of TV, Ron Ely is almost perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty by a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the women's management and veteran character Paul Wexler (like the villain, Captain Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And just maybe it was a plus in this case. The story does a good job of getting most of the audience to know the incredible group and at the same time get a plot to go. Using narration, by Paul Frees and short film clips, is the method that is being pursued to move the introduction together into history. <br /> <br /> From the start, there is advice that this story will go with the same kind of "Camp" humor produced as the Batman TV series. Some really nice early scenes that involve Doc, and the entire crew who make their individual specialties are thrown against humor by Paul Frees tale and the unexpected, unlikely results. (For example, an experiment with Doc with a miniature rocket / missile appears to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one thereof.) The whole story unfolds like that and hits the viewer with a small 'Camp' every so often that We keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. We are also amazed that Mr. George Pal is the producer (his last). He, who had been so famous for Special Effects, probably a factor that could be used for a sci-fi action setting of Pulp Character's world. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it all alive. Mrs Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, just born our 2nd child, Michelle (08/14/75). Our older girl, Jennifer, visited her grandmother, so after the visit there was in the maternity ward, it was just over to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was a little let down by the final product. I could accept a bit of this "Camp" business, but would not have objected to whether Mr.Pal would have liked to let it all hang out and have some really nice dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it a little more Pulp / Comic / Series-type voltage. <br /> <br /> And yet, the cast, led by Mr. Ely and the others, the whole movie to suffer, if not lovable. The phrases and locations were, as far as we can see, much like those of a 30's serial or adventure file that would be fun for anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's just what they tried for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE.
