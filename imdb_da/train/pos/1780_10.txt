My mother and I were coming home from a trip up to the Northeast (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to a Boston Film Festival. Now I don't know much about movies, so I thought it could be a little educational. The first movie we saw was this one, THE ROMO DIVISION. Now I don't know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas, and where I come from, we can't see too many movie pictures, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted it was too violent, but said I didn't know much about what she was saying, but it was a good picture. I was shocked by the fighting sequences, they were great. I'm also a big fan when the good guys win, so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. This was truly excellent. I'm not sure when it will be released on video, but if you get the chance, check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise, but it is rather violent and there are many cuss words so you may not want your children to see. It's more for adults.
