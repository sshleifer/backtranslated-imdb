Erich Rohmer's "L'Anglaise et le duc" is a perfect companion to Peter Watkins' La Commune (Paris 1871). "Both films -screened at this year's Toronto International Film Festival-ironic illustrate how history is shaped by storytellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the US during the festival. <br /> <br /> Set in Paris during the French Revolution, the film based on Grace Elliotts (Lucy Russell) "Memoirs" is a first-hand account of how she survived them heady but dangerous days, also describing her relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus ), which, contrary to itself, is a supporter of the revolution. <br /> <br /> True to forming, you do not know if the side of the story Rohmer is going to come down on. One of the earliest of the French " New Wave "filmmakers, Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative. In the midst of the rebellious-youth-Viet-Nam days in the late 60s and 70s, he played romantic little apparel like" Claires knees ". But don't sell it old boy card, people have always been a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues to carry this out. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" or the "good guys", they are primarily people who are able to exhibit a wide range of human potentials and limitations. Therefore, his film is always provocative, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now for the technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> However, Rohmer is still at the forefront of cinematic innovation. The view of "L'Anglaise" is like something you've never seen before. You guessed it, the old guy - like several of the festival's directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All the scenes of the film look like they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian settings. In fact, you may be so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the movie's watch you have to go back to another screening to capture the subtleties of the movie's psychological - and yes, I will say it - political insights. <br /> <br /> This year, Toronto has some of the world's most noble young filmmakers, as well as some of the world's oldest. And the old gentlemen are standing there on the cinema's cutting edges right next to the young. <br /> <br /> Long live youth. Long lived old age. And long life Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
