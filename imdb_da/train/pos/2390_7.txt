My 2 year old likes the Doodlebops show, it seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, alive with primary colors and all. There is not much educational content that the intended audience could benefit from, but they seem to have a theme each showing and trying to teach children to share and respect and others basically so I like it. It is well produced with high production values. But it's really just an average show like most of the shows on television these days. We do not buy into the item angle and have our son wearing everything Dooblebop. I don't think we would spend money to go to a live show if they ever came to town. Going to The Zoo or Science Center is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion the money is better spent.
