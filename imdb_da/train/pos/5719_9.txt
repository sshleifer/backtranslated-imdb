As I have noticed with many IMDb comments, some reviewers seem to require every movie they see to have smugly intelligent plots flying in their own wisdom. I'm not one of those people. If I see an action movie, I will see explosions, rifles and heroics. If I see a comedy, I will have tears of laughter in my eyes. You get the idea. Therefore, I see a horror movie, I will primarily be afraid. Grudge is a very scary movie, in both it is well done "jump" scenes, and it's scary imagery. I've been a horror movie fan for many years and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. The road scarier than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a good movie).
