Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sexy crazy teen, the clever mouth, the pot smoke and not forgetting the guy who burns things. Throw in a strict nonsense Sergeant, a gay Sergeant, and a sexy ammunition teacher, and it makes a crooked movie adventure. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie and it's fun because the comedy is turned around the fact that if you're trying to work together, things are done. <br /> <br /> These tapes of misfit students at the Weinberg Military School have been placed here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes "because you are out of stock, embarrassments for your families and communities, disgrace." One of Ralph Macchio's earlier beliefs before the Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with performances by Barbara Bach, also appeal to teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
