"Atlantis" is a new and real step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie of such a mysterious legend as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this movie, but after seeing it, I don't quite understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Even in my country, reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's biggest, though I doubt this movie will ever get "Disney classic" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's fun to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movie reputation, he he, I just kidding). <br /> <br /> Enough enough. "Atlantis" is a clear, exciting and very entertaining movie. Even this movie is a PG-rated action feature, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite must not kill me for writing this, he he). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it doesn't spoil the movie. The cartoon-inspired animation is suitable for movies and sets is a departure from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The movie is also fun sometimes, even though I giggled than laughing through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also very sympathetic, but unfortunately there is not enough time to know everyone so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The result of James Newton Howard is amazing. It is bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this movie is how they make Atlantean sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really amazing (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but still there are some questions that aren't answered in the story. But fortunately there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> If you are a service yourself, don't listen to the reviewers and see "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
