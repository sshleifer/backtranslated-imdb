Van trotta film rosenstrasse is the best movie I've seen this year. I'm actually not really interested in movies with a historical background, but with this she won my interest in that time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie has been the scenes in New York, and the impression I had "tried to be as American as possible" ... which I think has totally failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the back really came to my heart. the German actor Katja Riemann deserved its full price. She is one of the most impressive actresses I've ever seen. In the future I will see more of her movies. good luck to me that i am native german speaking =) and only a year in us so as soon as i am back i will buy some riemann dvd's. <br /> <br /> to everyone out there who hasn't seen this movie yet: see it !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is all about, especially all flashbacks and time switches are hard to explain, but just watcxh what you want to be sorry !!!!!!!
