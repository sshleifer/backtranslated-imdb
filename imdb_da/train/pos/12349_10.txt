This movie just shows you don't need big explosions, muti-billion dollars computer graphics or much over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is an excellent storyline and plot. as the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa pulls brilliant. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves an epic period piece. and for those who enjoy Kurosawa's earlier works. 10.10
