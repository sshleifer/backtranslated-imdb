The movie Torrent was a first and one last to Greta Garbo. It was her first American movie at MGM, the only US study that she would ever work on. It was also the last time someone else was billed over her in the credits, it was her leading man, Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez's work Entre Naranjos. It's about a couple of inconsistent lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can't quite get together, mainly because of Machines by Cortez's mother Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a wicked woman who has some ideas about who her son should marry. Remember this is Spain, and such arranged marriages were still quite proper during these times. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in mind as her sister-in-law, she is Mack Swain's descendant of a man rich in pig farming. Swain gives some moments of comic relief with its tender concern for piglets before growing into large old pigs to be slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had previously filmed The Four Rider of the Apocalypse and Blood and Sand with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It could have been interesting if Valentino had done this with Garbo, but he could have been without film production when this was done. In any case, one of Valentino Wannabe's Ricardo Cortez fills with the male management. <br /> <br /> One reason why Valentino might not have liked this movie is because the lead is Garbo's, unlike the other two works mentioned earlier. When she gets dirty from Cortez, which does what Mattox and her adviser banker Tully Marshall tell her, she leaves Spain and goes to France, where she becomes a great opera star. And totally lead the scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to rebuild things, Mattox is even more furious. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish parliament, curiously named Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam that causes all kinds of chaos in the countryside. Cortez actually strengthens Torrent in a row boat trying to save Garbo from the road. When they come together, they have a brutally honest discussion, the brutality comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, primitive, though they seem now, are quite remarkable for their time. They look very much like the shots that were used in the 20th Century Fox's The Rains Came, which came out in 1939, and won an Oscar for Special Effects. Unfortunately for Torrent, it came out a year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away any endings, so you'll have to watch the movie to find out if Cortez and Garbo finally meet. Garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and at an age when exaggerated movements were the norm in silent acting, she was remarkably subtle in her role. So she wanted to be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable close-up face. Although Greta Garbo would continue to do much better work than Torrent, this movie is still an appropriate debut for her on the American big screen and is very good at today's audiences.
