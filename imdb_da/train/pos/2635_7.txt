My Take: A fun take on LION KING, which constitutes a successor. Surprisingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another fun straight-to-video that's worth playing in the theater. I can't see why Disney released this directly to video and release crappy movies like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" theatrically. These movies are better seen in the video stores (in the "new releases" area) instead of watching their theatrical posters outside the theaters. This one is just a spear on the first movie (though the events of "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), on Timon (pronounced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaas (pronounced by Ernie Sabella) point of view. We'll see them make fun of the events of the first movie. Original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voices from the first movie, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller provide an adventurous comedy help like Timon's mother and grumpy uncle. /> <br /> Sounds funny. Maybe not now, but see it for yourself. The fact that it is not so serious in its plot makes it more comfortable. It's a bit like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video movie rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
