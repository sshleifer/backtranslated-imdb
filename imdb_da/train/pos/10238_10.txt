People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg leads a movie, and this movie is no exception. Some movies I love did poorly at the box office, but I'm happy to say that this movie is not one of them (over nine million dollars which I didn't think was bad for then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated movie. I didn't think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for young children (the audience for this movie), but I thought what happened to the scary professor at the end was a little too dark for a children's movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved a lot for years.
