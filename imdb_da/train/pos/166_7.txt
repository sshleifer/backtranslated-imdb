This was the first movie Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together, and they would continue to make more. Crawford stars a young rich girl whose father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They've never worked before, and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job at Gable, a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it's going to be an easy job, but comes in pretty quickly. Crawford becomes a journalist at a newspaper, but wants to work on the big stories, but gets worthless things to work on. Their is a massacre where several of Gables' men are killed, and Crawford was a witness to it all. It's a good movie, but not one of their best.
