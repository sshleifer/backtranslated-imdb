*** Can't consider having a spoiler, but I'd rather be careful than careless *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with the first time I saw it with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it again and again. <br /> <br /> For the little play Ilene Woods did in her life, she was a wonderful voice to Cinderella; very appealing; very trustworthy. The music really fits the movie perfectly. The action was great; loved the mice !! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the step-sister; they were just awful. The cartoons portrayed the spoiled behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are in love stories. My daughter has watched the movie about 25 times and is still tense at the end.
