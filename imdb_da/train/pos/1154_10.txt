I think this may be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just check out the "quotes" section; For second thoughts, just hire the DVD as it is the delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives you a comic, over-the-top performance that you've never seen anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a rebellion as the besieged consumer. I was never a great fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as the one * real * person surrounded by a wealth of cartoon characters on the phrase "The Sun Also Sets" - which holds you under you, Hemingway is rolling over in his grave. Either that, or he laughs really hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Fun, fun, fun.
