I hadn't heard of Brashear before I saw this. This is the story of him and the man who trained him, and helped him become the first African American American marine doll. A tale of willpower. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout. It looks like the typical underdog thing, and it doesn't hold too many surprises. It's also Hollywood, but hey, I don't know the actual man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. Nevertheless, it gets the job of dramatic scenes and adversity along the way, and it is inspiring to anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" talk about their lifelong dream. The acting performances are all good. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well-written, trustworthy and consistent. This is well-edited and has a good filmography. The production values ​​are high and it makes a pretty convincing job to transport us back to the 50s. This is the only movie I have seen by this director and the author, although I can now consider looking at more they are responsible for. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise not offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the topic interesting and / or fans of those who did it. 10.7
