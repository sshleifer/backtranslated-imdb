Poor geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is terribly burned because of a gruesome April Fool's daylight went very wrong. Flash up to a decade and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known for horror fans for her turns in Maniac, Faceless & The Last Horror Movies) in the prank is psyched for the coming 10 year high school reunion not aware of a court jester-masked murderer hides in school (now closed) school and out of revenge. <br /> <br /> Chaulk this one up to be a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the characteristics of one. But there's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to see it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I am even willing to overlook the horrible end (which I must say I hate). I guess I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager both get topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the ladies): A free cock shot by Simon Scuddamore at the start movie <br /> My character: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extra: Optional trivia track; trailer for this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
