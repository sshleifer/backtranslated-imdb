This episode apparently grew out of the Cold War. There has been a holocaust, but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through undamaged. It then becomes a fight for grass. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct of survival takes over. It is a quiet, slow moving chess struggle as they try to gain confidence. They come to the truces, but mistrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role in the sixties comes into play, and modern viewers may find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it is still captivating and interesting. Because she does not speak, we do not know very well here, but in the end we can guess.
