William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film that also starred Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show where Philo has entered his Scottish terrier captain serves as the backdrop for a local room mystery with too many suspects. The mystique is very wise, and denouement is both complicated and interesting. As the talkies are still quite young, the camera's work is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job of steering the action. <br /> <br /> The support molding is excellent; The entire casting brings the film up in a notch. Lots of actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was made before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to great stardom - he had already spent about 12 years in film and began his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92. We are fortunate to have his movies available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie - don't miss it.
