Peter O'Toole is an experience to see in roles where the lines he speaks are good and gives him a chance to swagger in drunk stupidity. The lovely Susannah York gives a good foil to O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The movie suggests that incest - without a single explicit scene - but it is able to entertain the viewer in its healthy social comment. While this is not a big movie at any expense, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a good treat to see, radiating tragedy silently. The possible weakness here is Thompson's retreat. But the movie is flowing because of the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie twice over 20 years - both times called "Brotherly Love". "Country dance" is a pretty dangerous and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.
