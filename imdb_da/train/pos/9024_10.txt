Five years after Tenko survivors return home and from Marion's double page "Well that's it". It is now 1950: Reunion Time. The bands are here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and late-morning Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original series. All the questions left at the end of the series have just been answered here. From Marion's family to the Joss health center, everything has changed in five years, and everything hasn't changed best. <br /> <br /> A trip to Dominica's plantation brings lots of shock and some really edge of this tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster, which in turn takes the fate over and the women are fighting for their lives. Dominica finally shows its true colors, and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama. <br /> <br /> Lush filming in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends It's such a shame that this is really the end. I could see it all over again. Perfection.
