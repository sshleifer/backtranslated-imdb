I saw a trailer for this at Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies with African Americans. It looked like what it is; a very tendentious "crazy" comedy in which an unbroken black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that Redd Foxx's (RF) wife has left him to his brother working with him at the "store" back in Phoenix. He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman's Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> As RF comes, Norman has nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts, coming out of his water to answer the door. Trying to buy time by getting his older father to take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman is trying to awaken his beloved, deviant speaker. It was just to the point where I wrote "WHY WILL NOT WAKE UP?" When he suddenly does so and I and my friend jaws fell to the first of many times when we presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed, swirling Garson, Norman's white living in-lover, who just "had the most faaaaaabulous dream? ? "Garson is a fiery queen of a type that can only be imagined as from 1976 LA He has dresses and a purse and large clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona at Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch. <Br /> <br /> Norman orders his lover to find another place to live during his father's visit. Garson goes with Waylon Flowers, and wife answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So RF is trying to reach his wife in Mexico. While on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him. With an outbreak in the 70s, soul music was meant to evoke its daily revelation (but more like we are hearing a particular trace of The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first impulse is "I will kill him, I will kill him." Then RF goes on a long walk where he cycles through all the thoughts a confused parent may have, like "maybe we trained the toilet too fast." His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees in his turn, such as a cold truck driver who arises just as he contemplates what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This must be said to be about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought. He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her to Norman to try out heterosexuality, but it pisses Norman and he storms out to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson comes over and offers to take the RF off the night. He commiserates over the loss of RF's wife and tells the story of her own mother who has an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because "she was bullied on a luau." They participate in a variety of achievements by Wayon and Mrs., who culminate in wife's fierce bashing her head toward the piano until her hair loosens. Once again, the mouths were agape. So it seems you didn't just want to know, RF and Garson have a nice evening together! You see, stubborn, traditional older black men just have to watch the crazy, loud entertainment of mega-queens to get around to ALL the gay world has to offer! It's really just as simple! This still does not prevent RF from shouting "Rape!" when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you think. <br /> <br /> There was so much going on. What is the basis of Norman's and Garson's relationship? They don't seem to have any report, and Norman has no trouble kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or speaks of their relationship. There were some kind of quaint touches like RF would buy all these books on homosexuality - and sit right down on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out of homosexuality, rather than just running out of being full or acting with her friends. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's just the way it looks like: a little relic of a bygone era, an era where some gay people thought that if just men just sat down and then on a dragon puppet performance, we could all learn to love and understand each other! And because of all this naivety, the extreme stereotype and message-laden dialogue has just come so charmingly obsolete and gives a lot of grievance to discuss how things have changed for homosexuals over the past 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them to sleep full and convert them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hi, check out Cinema de Merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in).
