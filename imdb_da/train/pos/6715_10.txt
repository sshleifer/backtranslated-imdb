I used to love to see "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" Friday night on ABC's TGIF. I think it was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to come together every Friday just to see this show and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was sweet and sweet fun. I liked Sabrina's girlfriend Harvey. He was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". These episodes were great. In general, I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
