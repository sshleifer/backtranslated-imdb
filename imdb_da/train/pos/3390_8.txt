The time is the future, and for many it is not clear, the day is now. In this last film for legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green," becomes a landmark classic. Many film films and environmental service believe that this is our last story. The film is taken from the short story entitled 'Make room, make room', but who's working title was changed to "Solent Green." History relates to Earth as it develops in the future, with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing less than catastrophic. Earth's natural resources are exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now 'Solent Green'. But there are those who know the 'right' ingredient in Solent Green and cringe for their own sake and fear divine retribution. The first is a food writer named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with Simonson's Bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security Manager Donnovan (Roy Jenson), targeting Thorn for a waste disposal plant. Thorn's boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him of "Higher and Hot" who want the case closed, but Thorn will not risk his "Job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him to death, but as the film, a final warning awaits. ****
