In the story of movies based on comics, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated. This is no ordinary cartoon superhero movie! It follows the exploitation of a modley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which includes Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman", as the pithy proverbs and questions of secret identities. Most of the superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with strange jobs and neurotic home life. So it looks like director Kinka Usher makes the heroes something that the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very fun. Although it will not be a franchise, it is still a pleasure to see!
