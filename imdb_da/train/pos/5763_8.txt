<br /> <br /> I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them, I see them all. Fear especially. My friends and I gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy ties, order a pizza and have a blast. One of those we got on Hollywood Video was this, Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a large box so I expected less than normal. The story is about a housing project built over a nuclear plant that has had the above layers bulldozed, and the second underground layer is simply covered. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered facility when some children fall into a hole in a hole. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point it is chunk-city. The gore effects and action never stop until the final credits roll. Okay, it's not a good art, but one is with joke dialogue and the over-the-top cruel thing was our favorite of the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bands" I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. And you could tell it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild ride.
