This movie is cold, just truth. We often think "oh no, it won't happen to me." But it can. Drug trafficking is big money, and often people are unknowingly (or tricked) into doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, only wanted an exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to really appreciate this movie. It is very emotional and raw. Worth looking at and definitely staying in your memory.
