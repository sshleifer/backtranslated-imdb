The freedom to have your own Sea Going Power Boat, the thrill of going on underwater adventures a robust, man of the adventurer and lovely (and so well equipped!) Assistants in fine bikinis were all specific sales points for "SEA HUNT" (1958- 61). What was the reason for producing a kind of ocean-going "gun for rental" * series. Let's look closer now. There must be some traces. <br /> <br /> Looking back, we see RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER! (1955). The star Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive divers working on the salvation of the Caribbean, including a pre-Fidel Cuba. The movie was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its history as for the manager's look in swimwear. Fine, Well-Made Women People in some really nice swimsuits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a plus for Guys; and the presence of robust athletic folk musicians showing their best beefcake "poses" is just as enjoyable for Gals. <br /> <br /> And there's an element that is a true legacy of this ancient RKO feature. It is on Soundtrack contained in musical queues and themes. It's the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (with Lyrics) will soon not forget it. Its Carribbean Beat is so lively and its rich use of the Orchestra's Brass Section is powerful and instantly gives instant impression and memory. The 45 RPM recording of this song made it the 10 most popular songs of the week for many Saturday nights on NBC TV's "YOUR HIT PARADE". We cannot remember just how many weeks or how high it is. (Maybe one can fill in on one topic, thank you!) So we came back to "SEA HUNT" and its own odyssey in getting on "Tube". The public had been submerged! Okay, but they would go to a television series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions got a reputation for equipping a type of product that was mostly not signed by the network for multi-station hook-up processing. But they had had some great successes with TV syndication. ** By this we mean offering a series for stations for exhibitions at one for a TV station per. Each market area. (Like the various Newspaper Syndicates "comics" sell various papers around the country and the world itself. <br /> <br /> Then we got "Mike Nelson" even in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges had existed in about 15 years or so and had transformed some very memorable performances into mainly support and widely varying roles in a pair of Boston Blackie movies (with Chester Morris) for THE STOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), BRAVETS HOME (1949) and WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way to his characterization along with a fine convincing athletic physics, looking like a guy living with his physical abilities. He did very well as a diver's diver, whether it performs duties aboard the ship or grooms under the sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did take on the role quickly, but unlike a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with SCUBA. *** before landing this Mike Nelson concert. But Athletic Mr. Bridges turned out to be a quick teacher, as so many of the close-ups showed that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbler (the air tank) and the flippers. <br /> <br /> Stories almost always involved the helping client to pay, just like a private detective would. So what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in swimwear, the better. <br /> <br /> Like so many of the other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, despite the fact that I believe "SEA HUNT" was the top syndicated television series, a success that the ZIV series had known together with as "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As far as the location of this underwater story is concerned, it was shown here in Chicago late at night (after 22:30) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as the WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember who was the original sponsor in this particular market. And there were even stage advertisements performed by Star! How good we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, who runs his motor boat. And as we were invited to return next week and see "..... another adventure of" SEA HUNT "sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin" The Creators of Old Style Store Beer! "all while Mike shook us and traveled an old style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your floating boat! We're telling the coast guard!) Then the boat will leave the dock, accompanied by Sea Hunt Theme and Rolling Credits. < br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figurative than literal, Mike was for rent and things ran a lot like a Deterctive Story NOTE: ** ZIV's syndicated successes included "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and its clone "Men in Annapolis"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course, SCUBA is an acronym for Self-Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
