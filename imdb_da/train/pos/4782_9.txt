Well, it certainly is unlike anything else directed by Lynch. No supernatural things, no violence, no profanity. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick. It's a bit slow, but maybe it was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week trip (that's my best guess). The characters are everyday people, and thus they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Anyone who has a sibling can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the battles are forgotten.
