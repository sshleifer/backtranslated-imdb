This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think it's better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave a fantastic performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is amazing in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another unfortunate character. I'm always amazed at the incredible number of characters John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man who doesn't solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his awe. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story is about; Honor of the common man against the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
