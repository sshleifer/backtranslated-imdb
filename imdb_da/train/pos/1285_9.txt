Frustrated middle-aged deputy lawyer George Maxwell (a good performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this image) can no longer be his insidious, free wife Edith (a completely bitchy Anne Bellamy). Even worse is the bad George also sat with a newborn baby sol and a huge lesbian teen daughter (crazy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an unfaithful fling with lovely, enticing and open-air swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (lovely game with sexy aplomb of yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications occur when George finds himself harassed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a nicely poisonous turn of Kathy Williams) who wants George to spring his psychotic biker girlfriend Laurence Mackey (a scary Robert Tessier, who has a hairy head here ) from prison. Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same guy who portrayed Billy Jack!) And the screenwriter James McLarty slips the sparkling nautical story with a winning and very entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling soft-core sex and raw violence. In addition, they accurately point to the unforgettable inappropriate sensibility of the 60s youth culture and relate the plot to a tight 75-minute maturity, ensuring that this movie does not exceed its welcome. A particular highlight arises when Candy invites his groovy friends over Maxwell's house to an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking, grueling rock music and of course hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. Stanton Fox's sharp black-and-white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the scary sleazy goings-on. Best of all, it's like a great showcase for the extremely charming and fresh face of Pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively illuminates the screen with its sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat.
