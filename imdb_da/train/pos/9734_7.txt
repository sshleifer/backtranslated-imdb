Now comes another, well-romantic comedy ... but unlike any other movie of this genre, this is by far the best I've seen in a long time. I will admit that first I would watch this movie because of Megan Fox and suffered because of Simon Pegg ... First of all, if you have seen a decent amount of movies, you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie and somehow ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Okay, now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg. I can't see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a much weaker movie, if not for Pegg's great performance. There are a number of good gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing very hard, thanks to Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie (I don't usually think of her as more than an average action resource, but she was really good at this one), then there is Jeff Bridges who is Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox who plays spoiled bitch star Sophie Maes ... great role for her ... <br /> <br /> All in all, while I generally do not agree with the reviews here on IMDb, I would totally agree with them. .. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie, it's really light hearted and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
