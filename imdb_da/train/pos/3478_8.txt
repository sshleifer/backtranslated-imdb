This was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought every episode had more edge to it, and the bad guys had a lot of creative thinking put in them (and even very scary and credible too). Some of the best episodes were "I left my throat in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand screams under the sea", "Ghoul, Bat and Ugly" and "When You Wish Upon A Star Creature". If you've never seen these episodes, do it. This series was a bit of a mixed bag but since there were other episodes that didn't seem to have the same kind of edge to them as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Ransom Of Scooby Chief". Like the series before, it became very well composed, interesting story and excellent character. As everyone says, it would have been so much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and distracting to the story that was told.
