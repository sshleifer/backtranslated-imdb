This movie is like marmite. You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this movie and expect a proper movie with decent production values, a good plot and great characters will hate it. If you go into this movie expect a low budget slasher, you will probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go into this movie, expect to see one of the most horrible characters ever set to film by Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely glorious in his over the top portrayal of the crazy, murderous coke enemy. <br /> <br /> The special effects are best at best, but really, who cares? If you're the kind of person who's ready to watch a movie, schizophrenia: The Whore Missing, you've undoubtedly seen scoring movies filled with gore. With the budget, this movie was made even though they had tried it, it would probably be mediocre at best. I'd much rather be able to laugh at something uncomfortable than being unaffected by mediocre. <br /> <br /> To sum up, you'll probably hate this movie, but if you're one of the few to decide to see it anyway, it'll be the best side slice of bread # 2 I hate marmit.
