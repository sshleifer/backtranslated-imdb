This is a very good Spanish film, but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish civil war was about or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage, but could easily see how the movie could be confusing until you gather all the pieces together. I doubt whether this would be a major concern in Spain, where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be a little confused until later in the movie. The movie begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and you collect that they come to Spain from New York City. Despite the peculiarity, Carol speaks pretty well Spanish, and much of the film is about how she adjusts. Regarding why her and her mother are alone, I am wasting it now for those who do not choose the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the republic (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film gets amazing characters for its lovely camera work and music. The rather slow and exciting pace is not bad, provided you are one who can accept movies this way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war, and this compares quite well to them - no better or worse - just a decent piece of life movie about those left behind, and a nice wine unit. /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side there are, the Republicans were mostly Social Democrats, and they were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The Nationalists were led by Franco and were assisted by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
