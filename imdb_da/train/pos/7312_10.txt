It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child I remember that I really enjoyed successors, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to get to that point. I saw it a couple of times recently, and now I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It is at night, his demented brother comes home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is supposed to be scary, and I think it succeeds very well. It is also one of the first slasher films, a horror subgenre that I always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, scary music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Should I say more? Anyone who has never seen it, scary fan or not should do his filming lessons right now. Highly recommended!
