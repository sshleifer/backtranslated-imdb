Some movies you just know you will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing it's roots back to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 40s - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays the protagonist "down on his luck", which is rooted in a murder wife murder plot - and his luck goes from worse to worse to even worse as he tries to get away from the people, the city, the violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists, amazing performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic slide-guitar musical background and seamless steering make this a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas meter in the exit car, he shakes his head and says, "F *** in" the story of my life. "
