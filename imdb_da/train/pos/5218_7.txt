The flock is unfairly malignant as a minor "Se7en" ripoff. There really is no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the corresponding landscape in the final showdown. Now, as it is out of the way, I go into why The Flock is very interesting in some respects. For the most part, it is a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. In the beginning you can clearly see that his work has got better from him. Apparently in two scenes where he first interviews an offender and beats him the second time when a woman tries to pick him up and everything he can think of, his standard question is from his questionnaire. Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his work is not unlike a police officer, he is carrying a gun and constantly checking newspapers and supplying information to law officials if some of his "flock" can be responsible for sexual crime. He is also a person who has lost all happiness in living, and his only relief seems to come from demanding his own vigilant justice on his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he apologizes for treating his partner rude and the other after he is beaten by a member of his party. <br /> <br /> As an exciting flick, The Flock is not that successful. Something confusing and with some annoying plot holes, but it has a number of nice sets. <br /> <br /> General The herd is a solid drama of a man who performs a dehumanizing job, and finally he has to work hard To remain swallowed by the abyss he is surrounded by himself. The world we live in is a beautifully sick place, and it can deviate from the worst, the happier the person is. The flock gets that point nicely.
