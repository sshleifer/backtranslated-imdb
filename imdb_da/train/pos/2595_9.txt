Brilliant adaptation of the highly interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick to restore the endless portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to celebrate - double entender calculated! Bravo director Strick, writer Haines, as well as casting director and cinematographer to create this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another fine-film adaptation of interior monologue that I favorably compare to Strick's film. <br /> <br /> While clearly recognized Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the movie, there are also recognizable characters, even though they are with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be such a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This movie for all its excellence becomes even richer by further viewing. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
