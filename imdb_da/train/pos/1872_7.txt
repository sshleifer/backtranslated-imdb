When I did not watch the movie in the original theater release, I was fortunate to be surprised when the DVD arrived as this movie did not have the broad distribution it benefits. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's director's debut and finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme of more accomplished directors. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot to be on the other side of the camera. He brings another angle to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things the movie has is undoubtedly the fine performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far without any doubt. He uses the troubled young man at this time of his life in turmoil and suffering for a bad life, so far he has treated him very much. His Antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give, but no one seems to see the side of his character. <br /> <br /> In the worst case of his despair, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober way if it somehow subdued. Because of the fear in Antwone, he lacks the opportunity to open up to this man who will help but because of the limitations that are in his office have just three sessions and then has to reject his patient. <br /> Things work out when Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffers from Mrs. Tate, his foster mother, is brutal, at least. Attempts by an elderly woman in Tate's house for a sexual abuse give Antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life as he has been shaken by the shame he carries with him. <br /> <Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see another world of love, she and support she gives him. <br /> <br /> The main performances are very good. Denzel Washington's Dr. Davenport also has its own problems. He is also not a happy camper. He can help Antwone, but he can't help himself or his relationship with an adoring wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a nice Cheryl. Novella Nelson, a fine actress, is great as Mrs Tate, the abusive mother-in-law. Reunion of Antwone with its unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental, but of course, if one is to believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, one must also accept that part of the movie.
