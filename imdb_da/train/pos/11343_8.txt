I remember watching this on TV in the late 70's - and it stayed with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great kids movie. I made it to some friends at a party recently - and of course they thought I was angry and expected something sick to happen to the dolls la "Meet the feebles" But no - it's healthy, fun. <br /> <br /> Jack wild is in good shape, as is mama cass and somehow attractive witchy poo. <br /> <br /> If you like banana split and you are in your 30s, this will restore the surreal childhood Saturday morning Even though I have realized now that Puf itself is a little shy - as everything he does, caught and run away! Quality TV Movies - if you're like you in death metal - you'll love it!
