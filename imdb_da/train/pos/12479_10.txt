What are the odds of a "Mermaid" helium balloon traveling from Yuba City, Ca. (November 8, 1993) and land 4 days later (November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. (About 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film not only helps children cope with losses, but also older people. Hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
