I finally got to see this after hearing good things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved, this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of economy has actually helped this movie in several ways, especially in view of the plot. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie was better for being shot on video rather than film. Another bonus: While most low-budget horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre to unintentional hysterical action, this movie actually had a talented cast (save one or two characters), especially the two leaders. The only thing missing from the movie was an original story. It borrows heavily from better-known films such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you are like me, movies of this kind never cease to be scary. Plus, the director keeps things interesting all the way through. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget, and I have a feeling that it is only a matter of time before we find out.
