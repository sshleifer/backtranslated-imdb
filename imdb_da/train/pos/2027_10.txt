What can you say about Tara Fitzgerald's convincing performance? She is absolutely credible as the wounded wife, Graham, who is hardened by experience, sharp and strong, but not immune to Mr Markham's passionate attention. Through every rude look and any glare of temperament, any flickering of the distinction in his eyes and telling facial expressions, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's damaged spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unformable villain. Yet, after all, what he has done is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end; He is at least aware of his own mistakes and how they have brought his ruin. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of - is a triumph of hope, hope, and faith in the value of any human life and soul, but rude, though sinful that person can be. Markham's constitution can then be seen as her reward for her faith and unpleasant moral character. Although the perceived moral ideas so strongly presented in the Tenant seem obsolete by today's standards, history is imbued with integrity, passion, and conviction that still has influence. Tenants are far more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; Here is an adaptation that makes the novel fair. I highly recommend seeing it!
