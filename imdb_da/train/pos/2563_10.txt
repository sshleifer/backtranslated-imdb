I have seen several comments on Brando using a southern accent, some of which felt it was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. The Jim Crow laws were still in force. Civil rights were in their childhood. Could this possibly have been a subtle social comment, a southern man in love with a woman in another race? Likewise, MASH was a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki, which appears "cold". Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotions in front of strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. The Americans in Japan were quite foreign to this culture, and the bluntest attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. One of the Japanese moves was to smile when they were embarrassed or unpleasant, as many American soldiers took as a sign that their progress was being welcomed. Also, remember that at the time represented in the movie, Japan had just been defeated and the occupation forces were treated with restrained acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been. Seeing her interaction with the American actors brought more memories of my own experiences in the country back. I could meet a couple of lovely young ladies who, after I convinced them that I was not the typical American man, taught me their language and culture in my time in their country.
