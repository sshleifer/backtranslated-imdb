I saw 'Speak lightly' one night and thought it was ok but lacked something. Perhaps Buster Keaton, strangely, cast me or a leading woman's birth. The next day I thought about the movie. I couldn't get Durante's song out of my head, I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd's first scene, I thought Keaton might have made some fun falls and physical comedy. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a peeping corpse trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with his sex appeal. A very fun scene, the actors excellent, their faces, their eyes, their silly expression. So I saw another scene, their show opens on Broadway. Buster in his happy innocence crushes every action. Again I laughed aloud and appreciated Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So next night I saw the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Stupendous! It's sensational! It's Sublime! Three good comedians! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Sure, it's not poifect ... but there's a lot of laugh in this picture.
