Jazz aficionados will treasure this classic card, showing some of the best jazz men who just do their thing. It's like watching a no-frills music video today. <br /> <br /> The jazz men give us an extra treat at Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side of the Street. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds remarkable as Billie Holliday. It's a compliment guys. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also tops. With the black cinema of its time leading to many white stereotypes, this movie must be seen and appreciated. No good production values, just a lot of good music.
