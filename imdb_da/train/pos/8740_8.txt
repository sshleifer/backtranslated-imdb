There are good details in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The movie looks good and the animation is sometimes staggering. The movie is not terribly ugly, it is basically a modern play on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, with errors only. I enjoyed the character interaction, however, and the evil in this movie actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. The grasshoppers are threatening, and Hopper, the leading bad guy, was a brilliant creation. Check this out.
