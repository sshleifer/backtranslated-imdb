My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby does. We bought him DVDs and CDs so we can watch and listen to them ourselves. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, sharing, and caring. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme song, he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts jumping up and down in excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a good voice. Moe is a fantastic dancer. I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can't help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
