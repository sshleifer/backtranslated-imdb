Series 2 has come to a good start! I don't think you should have seen Series 1 to get hold of what's happening, but like any series it's great to feel a sense of the characters and to care about what's happening to them. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 30-something women seem to live glamorous and exciting lives, but the premise is credible and realistic. So the twists that come, thanks to their love and sex life are exciting to see, but you also know that it is also a problem with real women. Its about the decisions we make as women and how we sometimes are led down certain paths in our lives instead of deliberately making those choices!
