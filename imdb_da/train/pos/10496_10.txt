Great actors, an Oscar nominated actress, great scenery, good strong history and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag (and that's pretty big). This movie was brilliant. It was beautifully traded in the more serious scenes and the fun moments were. .well, side shift I have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much, and tears poured down on my cheeks on the "rocky ladies in the tea shop" scene. Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson whose magical ingredients have made this one of my favorite films of the year, if not at all times.
