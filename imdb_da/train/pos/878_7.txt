Interesting characters, lots of tensions. So close to black and white without being black and white. I was dismissed by how random the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, near deaf secretary, could turn to crime to destroy colleagues, destroy people on the road and finally join a heist and set up a person who was hit off as a bait for his own get-away. I am a little discouraged by the tendency of otherwise quality films to depict criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the harm they have done to others than portraying their closest opponents as jerks. In this movie, we never know who is money, they are the ones they evade, or what happens to the innocent wife that the sympathetic deaf secretary uses to create the bad bar owner to take the fall to the lack of loot. Too bad the movie could have been good.
