After being sent to prison for no less than 10 or more than 40 years to be busted with drugs and refusing to give up, Jackie (Erica Gavin from Russ Meyer's "Vixen" and "Beyond the Dolls Valley" in her last movie role ) must get used to life in the big 'dollhouse' or at least try in this early movie by Jonathan Demme. Because of the silly nature and the pure surveillance, I would also place this as one of his best films, just below "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but so far above any of his other movie. This smaller classic is just campy, sleazy and fun enough to be an incredibly good guilty pleasure and fortunately never once goes overboard for everything out of the parade of the Women In Prison genre. It almost rinsed out of the ludicrous sermon "Philidelphia" from my mouth. However, the film is not without its downfalls (the "un'talent show" is a huge task to sit through and goes too long, Barbera Steele is unfortunately wasted among other little things) But don't let them stop you from seeing one otherwise funny movie. <br /> <br /> My character: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: 5 minutes Roger Corman interview; Cast & crew Bios; Original Trailer; and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity), & "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold, and some others show all skin
