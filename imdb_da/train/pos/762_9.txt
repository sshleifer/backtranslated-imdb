I enjoy watching people do breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes in this movie that takes you to a disco called "Roxy". Especially during the Christmas season, because there is also a "Christmas Christmas Law". <br /> <br /> Although this is an old movie, and even though I have recorded it from television, when Finland's state film archive showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It is much more fun on the big screen than on TV. Although many people here seem to see this on a big screen are a waste of money for the ticket price, I disagree with this and I believe that when I paid my ticket I got the money worth seeing this as it is at big screen, especially sitting on the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just video.
