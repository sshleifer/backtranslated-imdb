I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than "the always best actor" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some bad choices in movies, even though he is a wonderful actor, but in this we really gave the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger with Fishburne's well-presented paranoia and, moreover, we get finally a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I don't think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mix of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and not to forget the burning eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at its peak, Ir√©ne Jacobs Desdemona is pretty good but a little gloomy while Laurence Fishburne really lifts it and makes it a very interesting and fun movie. Look at it.
