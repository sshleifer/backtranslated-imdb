I just watched this movie on TV .. I lost my dad when I was young and this movie probably touched me .. <br /> <br /> I feel the lost little girl Desi felt .. feeling wanting to see her dad again .. <br /> <br /> would like to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least given the chance to say goodbye .. < br /> <br /> and I'm so touched with the letter that was written back to her. <br /> <br /> says her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to answer her And buy her a gift because there is no store in heaven. <br /> <br /> It just makes me feel like miracles exist ..
