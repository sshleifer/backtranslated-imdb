Always fancied this movie from the videotape. Eventually came around to buy it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a movie. A simply amazing achievement from the whole case, and it's filmed so beautifully. Even at times from a distance, you can hardly hear what the dialogue is, as if you really are the distance away from the story. It is really moving, often entertaining and very attentive. Not much dialogue, but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout. A 9/10 from me. One should see.
