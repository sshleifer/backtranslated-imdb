FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (the origin of Off Off Broadway). Although not for everyone, it is a truly brilliant, dark fun, more often deeply disturbing tale of love, sex, personal freedom and revenge. A serious moral story is even more relevant now at a time when Congress wants to ban homosexual marriage by destroying our constitution. The story is not about being gay, but it is about love and sex that does not comply with social norms and must therefore be removed through violence and hatred. On the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any big template, it is not really about animals, it is about something bigger - swirling in America. <br /> <br /> The scene version won international recognition in its original production, it toured the United States and Europe, and with others of its kind, almost every theater influenced it. Fortunately, we have kept the show pretty much as it was originally designed, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary, easy to take studio movie - this is an aggressive, disturbing, delightful, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative storytelling that you will never forget. And it can just change the way you see the world ...
