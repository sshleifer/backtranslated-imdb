There is plenty written about Mamet's "The House of Games"; Mostly good. I decided to revisit the girl to see how it stopped after 17 years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed seeing it again. The movie's success and durability probably have a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his signature moods and obvious histrionics to the movie while he scamming us, the audience and the brand at the same time. Then he only explains the art of closing only to do it again, etc. The whole time builds the story. "The House of Games", now a freebie on cable, is worth looking for first timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans. (B +)
