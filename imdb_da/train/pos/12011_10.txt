I am stunned by the negative comments I have read and can only assume that the people who made such remarks were less than honest. This is Joseph Smith's most moving and true portrayal I have ever seen. It was well-acted to the point that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Joseph's life with adversity, good-natured optimism, persistent faith in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice to life in such a way that honestly left me speechless and quiet in awe. If any of any Christian religion can see this movie without being touched in any positive way - I would say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie. I give the film a "10" and urge honest souls to see it. At least it is an extremely heartfelt depiction of man who gave everything he had for what he believed. In a world where values ​​and beliefs become ridiculous, this film stands as a lasting reminder of what kind of people we assume no matter what religious beliefs we hold .- Ann Pruitt-
