I went to this movie expecting an artistically scary movie. What I got was frightened by scare. It's a horror movie in its core. It is not boring as other horror movies, where a haunted house has ghosts and ghosts only. This movie doesn't even show you the most deaths that show the characters' fears. I think one of the best things about the concept is that it is not just the house that jokes what goes into the house. They are haunted wherever they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. After reading some of the external reviews, I am really surprised that critics did not like this movie. I'm going to see it again this week and am excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie was going to. It scared me out.
