First of all, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are big, cumbersome wholes in the story, and questions raised will not get anyone nearer to being answered; 2) The film is not for all people, so rude viewers become restless and begin to move under the film. <br /> <br /> Item two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type of theater (like the one I went to), you can hear the wheel through the projector at times. I loved it. The movie doesn't keep you busy with music or effects: it lets you reflect on what's happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that creates an atmosphere that is fascinating an enjoyable one. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would highly recommend it to movie theater fans as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those who base their appreciation on a movie exclusively on the story are completely disappointed. It's the kind of story you have to tie the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty crazy, but surely pretty excited!) If you start capturing the movie, there is a very cool part: when the two policemen talk to each other on their cell phones. An ultrasound sound effect that really puts you at the moment. Hats off to the person who was thinking of doing this.
