I want to be honest, I finally checked this movie not because of the stars - even though they were reasonably attentive and convincing, especially the three leaders - or even the compelling story of a break in the presidential secret service (something I 'I am Being informed through the DVD extras of this show, has never ever happened. It is remarkable that it is true!). I got it because it was fixed and have a choice cameo of none other than detective Meldrick Lewis !! Okay, Clark Johnson, one of my faves from "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say that he does as well as possible with a project that can be seen but fairly average, despite the possibilities. Veteran and Ace Secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) will find out both who fend off him and who killed his friend, targeting and blowing an air force a helicopter and making for Prez. (David Rasche. Someone remembers "Sledgehammer"?). His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of HOTTER's first ladies we have ever had, fictitious or genuine) certainly does not help his standing. He must both equip the real mole in the service and avoid the dog's dog as a hunt for his former best friend and associate and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost entirely in "24" state). Throw some other pivotal Service Agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy, something hard to buy as Gig Eva Longorria) and shady alien characters, and you have a pretty standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it claims and when desired, if underwater results. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers. DVD extras for me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie, even though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself with) interested.
