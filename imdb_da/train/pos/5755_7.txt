This is a pretty strange movie. It faces an exploitation movie with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations, but uncommon to be built around rural signs of war with each other, as opposed to an invading 'other'. <br /> <br /> The movie is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a wide variety of films depicting the animals of that war as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is 'I am not lost a war' when he meets his death after hitting a long track of murder and destruction, including the city's police officer and his brother's boyfriend in a special chilling scene. But Kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth. Vincent is obviously the golden boy, but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness. The movie has some plot resemblance to Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The movie has b-movie grade action, although Kristofferson, Vincent, a beautiful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give it an A-class lineup. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 to be a long lost prospect of a US psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a film industry willing to deal with them topics at that time. <br /> <br /> Seen on this channel, a great network that continues to play many old movies from the 70s to 90s, regardless of political bends.
