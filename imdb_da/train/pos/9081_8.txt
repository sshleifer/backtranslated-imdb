If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends then you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen many years ago. Although the play may have been slightly less than desirable, history and effects compensated sufficiently for it. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen this in the theater on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore .... you have to watch this movie !!
