Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this start of gangster movies performed in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s, catching a child stealing a puppy and then telling him in flashback how he came to own the pet store. He turned to the theft at a young age to get his mother a pancreatic operation ($ 49.95, especially this week) and began working for a bully (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerous" in the mobster world. <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a rebellion like Johnny's foul-mouthed mother who ever needs the organ in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very fun performance, like Griffin Dunne, a retriever DA who doesn't want to "play ball" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is amazing. Richard Dimitri is a standout like Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you must hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it fun is that he does everything with an angry face. The movie gets a little tired towards the end, but it is well worth seeing, and Keaton is great as a good boy / poor boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was underestimated when released, and like Keaton's second gem, "Night Shift," you don't hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" incredibly fun.
