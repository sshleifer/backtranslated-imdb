One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the game before I watched the movie and loved them both. It's the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to come to America because he can't make a living in Ireland. It is told both from the perspective of the young person (as the other characters in the film can see) and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings. But as cannot be seen by the other characters in the film. It is a very sad movie, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish movie or almost any movie about Ireland, and any movie that has late Irish actor Donal McCann in it gets my vote. I wanted to see the man chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately I have it. shame to have lost him so young.
