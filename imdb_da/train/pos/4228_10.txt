A top notch Columbo from start to finish. I especially like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an avid Columbo fan, I can't remember another where he doesn't create the killer at the end as he does in other episodes. In this one, when he tries to determine the correct order of the boxes and the "message" that the nephew left, it finally begins to hit him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good as it is in many others.
