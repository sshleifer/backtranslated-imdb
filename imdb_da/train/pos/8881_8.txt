First, one must take into account the period this movie was made in 1995. Rappers were in it and it was added to the flair of it. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teen who tried to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was conscious of Nazis. They took him in. Nazis are not all that awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a gap that is lacking, if economically, socially, emotionally, regardless. Michael Rappaport played the game perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the hot shot track star, with a dubious work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He went on trying to get upset with himself and his suffering and made his girlfriend and professor fix it. Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was date raped. She then found her self-experiment with her sexuality and became politically involved. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with racism and, like most things dealing with racism, people's own perspectives come into play. <br /> <br /> I read so many comments on how there were no 'bad' black characters, but there was vicious white one (Nazis). So what? Remy was not portrayed as evil at all, he tried to find his way and was wrong until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared it was sad to see him exercise how he did. He even says just before he kills himself, I didn't mean I would be an engineer. Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were delicate black men, ice cube was somewhat intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a stupid thug. They both did not at all consider their roommates and generally do not seem to like white people. They were angry as the Nazis, but not at the Nazi level in terms of overall badness. Excuse me if it makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = -bad black = good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which are more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy and even Remy was a good guy, he was just wrong. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inappropriate. Though their constant police harassment seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in also seemed to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like any movie dealing with racism, it's a good deal to get a discussion. <br /> <br /> I don't think Cube and Busta could beat these Nazis themselves.
