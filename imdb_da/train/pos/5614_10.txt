It took a long time before I could find the title of a special video game in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies ever. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I must admit that I couldn't laugh when I saw it for the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski seems so lovely and even sweet in his shy behavior, but on the other hand, he this boy in the playground and there is no explanation for it. But the most woven thing is of course his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact that he doesn't know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most scary in this movie. Of course, that's all in his mind, but is it this flat that brings this female side of him out, or was it before he moved in - I think it's an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is terrible to see his two sides or identities fighting each other. The result of this is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of the window. But this terrible cry - does it mean that everyone will repeat again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - it's not an incident, but a clue in my view.
