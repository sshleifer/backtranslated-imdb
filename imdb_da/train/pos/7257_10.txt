The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and knew very little about it being done until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote it to some manufacturers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I heard about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably concerned when I heard it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson through my agent if he might like me to make another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name away. I had no idea what they might have done for my manuscript. Then I was invited to watch the finished film. I was so impressed that I asked very quickly to get my name back on. It is a beautifully crafted piece, from a hastily written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; Maybe if I had it it wouldn't be that good. I would love to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I would also love to watch the movie again, I only saw it once in a small show theater in Soho.
