Okay, so Robbie is a bit of hokey looking for today's standards, and some of the actors are pretty stylish, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old kid with a decent computer editor. And don't get me started on the poster. <br /> <br /> This is still a good movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching "science fiction" at the local TV station "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoon, so I've seen a couple of SF movies from the 50s. At a time when most movies were happy to put a rubber costume on someone and make him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed it was possible to make a science fiction movie that actually had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt many SF movies made in the 90s are still considered worth seeing in 2030.
