Had a bad day? Dog bit mailman? The car wouldn't start? People got on your nerves? Then refresh yourself with a wonderful experience. Two women decide to pool their resources in response to a one-month rental villa in Italy. Because of the economic conditions, two other women go with them. Two have humdrum marital life; one is an older woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman who is completely confused by life. <br /> <br /> As the villa's syllables permeate their spirits, each grows in its own way and is raised in her outlook. This also changes the people in their lives who have visited them. As they leave you, the magic of the villa will stay with them ... and you will find your prospects changed for the better. A nice uplifting movie!
