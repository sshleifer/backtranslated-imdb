This is an excellent modern movie noir .... "excellent" because it is interesting, start-to-finish. There are some gaps in here and some bumpy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ..... but I haven't found anyone who didn't get caught in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, excitement, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it cultivates some beautiful colors and films as well as a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I marked this film a "film noir" because it's greedy and all the characters aren't good. Even the only supposedly good guy played by Nicholas Cage gets into trouble by lying and having a quick affair he shouldn't have. He also does something at the end, which is not true, but I do not want to ruin it by saying. Suffice it to say that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Are you talking about "evil guys", does anyone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "disturbed" category, he is hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to look for a lot of reasons. J.T. Walsh also provides another great supporting performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that never got much publicity but it should have. You want to have fun watching this. By the way, try to say the name of this movie three times fast without destroying it!
