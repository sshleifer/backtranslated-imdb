This is certainly one of my early fav episodes of Trek. There is only so much going on in this one movie that it is cute cool. First, the guys beam down to a strange planet that is about to explode. They meet a freaky librarian type guy (very well played). Then Kirk manages to get transported back to what is much like the 17th century land. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow, but almost freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years earlier. Kirk manages to unlock himself and leave witchcraft, while Spock enjoys some crazy time with a sexy cavegirl who was overcome for this frozen, horrible world of a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Spock determines hes happy how hoarse and gives McCoy a royal assestment whuppin 'when the doc suggests they should seek a way out. In any case, they all escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. It takes a ton of convincing before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally taste the sadness at the end. Leaving the cavegirl alone in its frozen wilderness just seems cruel and is really touching. Spock must have been out of his volcano's mind to leave his greatest hope of love and humanity. But in a not so nice neighborhood! <br /> <br /> In any case, you get as much bang for your buck with this episode .... A love story, the Salem witch tests, Spock as a human, the desperation to be left in total isolation .. Abandoned and three completely different settings on the alien planet. Its amazing managed to jam all this in a fifty minute movie. This is a classic, don't miss it .... I want it on dvd go shure volcanoes !!!!!!
