Airwolf The Movie, A variation on the original 2-part pilot, But the film, even though it is shorter, contains extra footage Invisible in the 2-hour pilot The pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot movie is usually the same ( 2 parties combined) But the film is actually another editing with extras here and cuts there. <br /> <br /> Worth to see, even if you have season 1 DVD set, I will still download a copy of "movie" It is still in some stores like virgin, Woolworths and similar mixed media stores, although in general requires ordering, but it saves having to buy online (as many of us still do not trust or trust online shopping) but if you look at airwolfs in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the 80s most popular ratings. <br /> <br /> A full size Airwolf is currently being rebuilt for a Helicopter Museum:) Info and work in progress photos are on http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games it seams she finally is re to be :)
