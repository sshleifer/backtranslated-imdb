This is my favorite movie, EVER. I have seen it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family asks me not to see it, so I don't want a crying fit. I think I love that it's a true story written by Antwone even as much as I love the movie. The action is top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has made so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious little boy I had ever met. He has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I watched this movie while the fight was still on, and his future was uncertain, and I'm so happy he's safe and loved. And I'm so happy Antwone is happy and found her family. <br /> <br /> I would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family. I just can't say enough good things about it !!
