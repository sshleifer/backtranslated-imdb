This is one of the best movies I've seen this year! I'm not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she's excellent as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is amazing as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is hysterical as Miss Bates. And check out the beautiful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Anyone who said you need sex and violence in a movie to do it well has never seen Emma. I think that's what sets it apart from so many others - it's classic. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie you can watch with the whole family, or look for a romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is that movie. With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes and an excellent cast (have I mentioned the beautiful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
