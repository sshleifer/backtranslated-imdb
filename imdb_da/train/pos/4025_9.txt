Superb. I had originally believed that when Amrita Pritam's communist fate and dr. Dwivedi's nationalist leaning film will be more honest than novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find out that it was the other way around. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Marita Pritam for not being pseudo-sec and for Dr. Dwivedi to be objective. This film touches a sensitive subject in a sensitive way. Accidents with any war are women who some poets said and this movie personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on Hindu psyche as they cannot resist kidnappers by their girls or the Hindu brother who can only burn his plagues. On the other hand, it also shows economic angles behind the partition or actually why girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt. will not be able to ask them to return houses. This several will pay tribute to the courage of characters in Puro and her Bhabhi, they are two simple villagers reminiscent of the foreign world and risk everyday by trying to come back after being disgraced. Because there are many documented cases where such women were not accepted by their families in India. No wonder it required a woman to understand the pain of other women.
