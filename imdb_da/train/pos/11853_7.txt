Life Pod is one of the movies you just look at and doesn't try to analyze too hard. The actor is at best amateur. Of course, special effects are low budget, but not so bad. The story is quite stocked, but with an interesting twist. Computer runs amok, but not exactly a computer, and the running amok is very understandable when truth is revealed. Still, the film has its moments and is completely visible. For me, at least part of the film in this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but has been a former playmate this month, she is sweet enough. Throughout the Life Pod, there is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies from the 1980s and a little predictable. The white star line is cute if it is completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was Britannic (not the Titanic's sister) sold to scrap in 1960.
