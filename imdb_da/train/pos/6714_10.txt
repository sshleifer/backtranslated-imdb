Why did I enjoy the show for the last episode? Due to the true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her support cast had demonstrated that whit, comedy, merry humor and deep thought could actually coexist. What I enjoyed most was that I could come home from a hard day's work and bust a smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to see as this magical person was so happy while helping others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was quite in my opinion ... although she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own ... to very different; she had power at her fingertips, desires and command that could be used for good or bad, which can only exist in many of our beliefs. Most of what we see, have, know, own or even desire ... can be used for good or bad, and how we choose to define it, defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She raised the globe and other worlds with these constant and motionless ideas in mind ... learning, living, laughing, and loving. She always learned to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; She made mistakes when she lived her life, went through another journey of growth, as she, her aunts and Salem (the undervalued but imperfect hero) did well to demonstrate that even at fault you can still be noble, gifted and wonderful. <br /> <br /> She also showed many selfless, learning and loving actions as she walked along the road. If this is not enough for 10 stars in this war-torn world where people are so hostile to each other, not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill ... then I do not know what is. This show was definitely a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better yourself and a gift that should bust a smile on our chops ... I have previously heard from a doctor all that I mentioned above leads for a healthy "hart" ... and isn't that what we all need? :)
