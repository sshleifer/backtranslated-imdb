The number of times I've had tears in my eyes when watching movies are few. And there is only once where I really cried, and that was when I saw this movie. This movie has some clichés, but I don't care. I cry just as I write this, and it was some time since I saw it. It seems perfect and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. It is only when we love that we really are alive. I know how sentimental I sound, and I promise, I'm usually not like that. I'm pretty cynical. This movie has shown stronger feelings of both grief and happiness in me than any other movie, and it will always be the first movie I recommend to others to watch.
