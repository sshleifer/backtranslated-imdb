In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the cinema's great directors and great pioneers, created a lightweight comedy gem that, for all its ease, is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film that clearly influences subsequent filmmakers such as Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian . The reason, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot, but must seek frantically throughout the city for the missing ticket, is basically just a unit to support a number of wonderful witty comics scenes introduced in a dream world of the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this movie is that even though it is set in the center of Paris and does not contain anything that is actually impossible, it achieves a lasting and engaging adventure / fantasy atmosphere where it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they speak or that a juggling over a stolen jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million contains what may be the funniest opera ever put on film (O the blonde braided soprano! "I laugh, have! Ha!") Also a joy is casting: Clair has assembled a group of fantastic, distinctly different character actors, each illustrating with deadly satirical accuracy a bourgeois French "type" so that the film looks like a set of Daumier prints come to life. <br /> <br /> Hilarheid takes some time to get rolling, and I found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films.) For these reasons, I do not give the highest rating. But these smaller caviles should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? In every way. Highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work with cinema or just a fun comedy.
