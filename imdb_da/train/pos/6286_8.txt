gone for 60 sec. where do i start, it keeps you in the movie with some good actions and some cool cars. People say it's not a good movie, I disagree that it has some cheesy parts, but what action movie doesn't. I gave it an 8 out of 10 reason for the action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off than this movie is right up in your slick cage dose a good job with one of the most under rated actors in my mind Share -Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people far out in movies sometimes, you have to sit back, enjoy the movie and, in words, ask yourself, they achieved what they showed. which means that if they went into action, it was a pact of action. If they are trying to make a movie to change how films are made and are trying to win each prize out of their good, did they? I think they made the action movie they are thinking of making it a chance, and you won't be sad.
