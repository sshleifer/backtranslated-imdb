updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or music dramas, to be more precise (Meistersinger is the other.) Although it's hard to imagine it as " top of anyone's popper ". The libretto, as the composer as usual, is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism and possibly even homo-eroticism, and its length can make it audiences like hearing paint dry. <br /> <br /> Wagner being a famous antisemit (Klingsor may be one of his surrogate Jewish villains). Of course, the premiere entrusted to an unrepentant (not for the will of RW's attempts!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go figure!) Kundry, a most mixed-gal and another likely Jewish surrogate, is both vicious or benevolent, depending on the scene. Considering that many video versions of Parsifal seem to be stodgy side, this movie of the opera is in comparison a fresh air. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, has brought great imagination to it, but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices. For example: the infamous double parishes (of each sex!), The puppets, the death mask-of-Wagner, and various dolls and symbols as Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the actual music to cover the scene revolutions.) Although Wagner himself died far too early to be an actual Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his other wife Cosima.) Were in the smallest fellow traveler, including their grandchild Wolfgang Wagner, who still runs the Bayreuth Festival in an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang's son Gottfried Wagner, in complete opposition to his father, tried to make honest conviction with his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous about what I've read. In 1977 he made a famous movie about Hitler, "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (Sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English.). Since it lasts for 8 hours and is not widespread, most have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the leader of the audio CD on which this movie is based, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick plays the two Parsifals (both songs by Reiner Goldberg.!) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland both play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period and everyone (except Kundry?) has been described as being significant between actions 2 and 3, nobody sees one day older at the end of the opera. (The magic of the Grail? In this opera, the grail is the cup from which Jesus drank at the sacrament and not Mary Magdalene as in recent times, an idea I find sensational!). <br /> <br /> The management and song are all quite useful and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the picture, to a great extent. (Yes, I agree that "Kna's" approach is superior, though the other stereo edition, but he is probably better than all recorded versions at all.) Not a Parsifal for all Wagnerites, but I think it seems pretty good as a filmed opera.
