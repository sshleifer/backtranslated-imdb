I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself thinking about it two days later. The story of a lost son (Scott Cohen) returning to his family's tailor-made furniture business after a jail in prison gives it all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp, observant dialogue; Sensitive use of the camera by a film maker who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it presents something too rare in the multiplex these days: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensation. The talent of director actor Todd S. Yellin seems to be full blown, but we get the sense he (as his protagonist) has paid his fees. He knows how real people are struggling in this world, and he knows how we long to see - or at least experience vicariously - success. Yet Yellin respects his audience too much to blow up happy smoke in our rear ends. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph does not lie in commissions or even in his family, but in the "work" he could not trust if he tried. <br /> <br /> It is an important theme in a world (and especially a film industry) that cannot rise above the "bottom line". This movie deserves a wide audience.
