After high school graduation, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to take a trip to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After some time with Nick, he asks them if they will take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport, however, they are busted to smuggle drugs and then get sentenced for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they haven't done. Not really knowing what to do, they stop contacting Yankee Hank, a US lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Words have it that if you have money, he can help you. Things start well, but they still can't get out. The film is really good because it does not turn on what will happen and it is interesting all the time. However, I couldn't believe in the end. It was one of those ends where you do not know the 100% truth, but you are still able to know what really happened to Nick and drug smuggling due to "owning" etc. Claire Danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here. However, Beckinsale's performance was a little weak. Both the Danes and Beckinsale's characters friendship are good, but could of seemed stronger. Paul Walker even has a small unredited role here. ;) <br /> Anyway I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10.
