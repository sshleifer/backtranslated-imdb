The fascist chief Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is lent by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she was ten feet tall) has a plan to turn her high square. Complications result in the challenge of the nice rock'n'roll Riff Randell (PJ Soles, who lights up the screen - she also has a hot bid), an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose large rhymed glasses and nerdy role cannot hide his stunning beauty) goes with Riff to put an end to the suspected crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good, which is Togar's desired mission . /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a fun role as Tom Roberts, a success on everything but being laid. Kate loves Tom .. if he could only pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the movie almost (honestly, who can steal this movie away from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, the "vendor" who can get everyone almost anything. His office is located in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who is allied by Riff when he enjoys a concert by RAMONES. <br /> <br /> A raucous high school torso that tolerates all the rules of normalcy .. and I loved it. It's like someone says, "Let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours." The movie is really anarchy .. a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring THE RAMONES with all it's heart (although they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to get new audiences with this movie). <br /> <br /> ending up pretty much sums up the movie as a whole. Riff and her classmates take over high school and a massive party begins. To be honest, I wouldn't have the party to end! Not conventional in any way, this movie just lets us lose a frenzy. Accompanied by a stunning rock soundtrack with some of THE RAMONES best songs, this movie gives a viewer the opportunity to accept a time of life as war did not dominate headlines and people just had a good time. Those I guess were the days.
