Although most Americans have little knowledge of their work besides Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced a fantastic working group - especially in the 1940s-1950s - from dramas to strange comedies. I especially love his comedies as they are so suitable and seem so natural and real on the screen - much different from the usual Hollywood fare. <br /> <br /> That being said, it was the movie that sparked my interest in these movies. The plot is so quirky and sweet that it is very unlikely that the film would be made anywhere - except for Ealing Studios - which had a special love for "small" movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist working for a textile company. He will experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, even if he does not work for the company as a researcher, but for guarding! Then he tends to sneak into laboratories (either during the day, if no suspicion or at night) and try his hand at inventing. He repeatedly gets caught (as after he blew up the lab) and got the luggage for a day, he actually succeeds! So, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unexpected chain of events - and then begins the funeral. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
