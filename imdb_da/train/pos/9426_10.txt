This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed at my sides split and rolled around on the floor. If only someone would release in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it's released in the UK, but it's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let us give this series its just trembling. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's quirky, goofy role in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Release this show in America! or Show it again at the PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please greet us, thank you! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
