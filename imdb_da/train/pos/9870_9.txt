With a relatively small budget for an animated movie of just $ 60 million, the folks at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. <br /> <br /> They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, perfect cast talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very entertaining family movie with a strong message co-operation, friendship and care for your fellow crew members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make a crew. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie, I got a strong political message to come together with the people who share your space - perhaps it must be necessary to look for all world leaders! <br /> <br /> Another new member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - David Newman gives a great score that is not intrusive but serves to move the action together and sometimes is positive toe bottling. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the movie is incredible; an intensely colored, oddly credible fantasy land of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were also wonderfully credible, with Ray Romans' Manfred's facial expressions being a special treat. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of DoDos gives no doubt where the phrase `Dumb as a DoDo comes from. '<br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can alert or scare children, very dirty - but real anyway. <br /> <br /> Watching the theater and buying at home would be a great movie.
