I really love this movie, watch it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great actor, good story, good directing / camera work / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad did jaco van dormael not make any more films after this. Top 5 work. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today, the comment above is 3 years and 3 days later. It was never posted because it was no more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw the "laughing mind" again yesterday. This is undoubtedly in my movie top 3. along with "Cinema Paradiso", which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I'm really curious about "jaco von dormael's new movie". I hope it will complete my movie top 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you want to see it again.
