I watched this movie without knowing it at all and found it thematically thematic for Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a troubled father / son relationship. In both films, the son will not follow his father into the mines and dream of a better life away from their hometown. Both sons face their classmates, and both have a strong female role model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The big difference I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern sets in motion and Chris Cooper plays the distressed father very well, as he continued to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle instruction, very different from his other direct features like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
