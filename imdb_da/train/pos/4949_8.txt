10 POINTS OR Smaller is one of the 'under radar' images imbued with the simplicity that most independent films have: Honest ad hoc performances by its two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who establish a quite complementary if unlikely duo. The big thing is that this whole movie looks unlikely despite its 'road movie' roots. How Morgan Freeman's named character is psychic (not physical) arrives at where he meets this enchanted check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current guide (who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering man being played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left for us to testify more than derive and their Kuwait help - two people on opposite sides of the coin - is misleadingly simple. So in a nutshell while there is nothing scared! Moments of earthquake revelations, this movie is a nice little mood that probably was lost in the Indians blowing out in 2006, but deserves to be seen if only honest.
