Deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Definitely a classic in its own special way. This movie provides a refreshing second look at barbarians. If you get the chance to watch this movie, do it. You will surely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's fun or something like that, but because it's so bad it goes the other way and gets good, but maybe not clean, fun.
