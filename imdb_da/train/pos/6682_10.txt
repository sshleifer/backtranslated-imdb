I saw this in theaters and absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush provided the best performance as a super villain I've ever seen since Gene Hackman like Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a fighter in heaven. This movie also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Raja and I especially loved that the sign was not really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was superhero, almost brought tears to his eyes. I loved the fact that the bowls spoke to the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller and his character Mr. Furious's fake anger and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish and that they never had any meaning. I could hardly stop clapping when he said "fraculater, freinken puss" was said. But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I highly recommend this movie for any occasion and I give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.
