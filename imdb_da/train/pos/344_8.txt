Another post in the category "Holiday Horror" that fills the shelves in your local video store. * Spoiler * "fake nerdy teen raising on the" cool "kids who expelled him" plot will of course be known to those who have seen it before. And those who have seen it before will probably see it again; Those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and subsequently being horrified by their lost time must just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye lights - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.
