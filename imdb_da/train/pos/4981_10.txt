I feel that this movie is a rare treasure. Not only is it the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You have to understand that certain things we would see as sexual today would be considered innocent. The parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to watch this movie saw this as just children who mimic adults. Most people did not believe in anyone who saw the children sexually attractive, other than teenage boys lust for teenage girls. For them it was not sexual. Remember, it was before we had internet, TV, etc. Most sex crimes were not openly brought up. Occasionally there would be a whisper about the child with the "funny uncle." But it was often all that came of it. Yes, very sorry. But it is a little sad today, because even I can also see this movie as something other than what it was meant to be, innocent and fun. When I saw Shirley dance like that, and the boy's eye caressed her, well, I felt disturbed. I have to remind myself of the time this happened! These kids didn't know what sex was. The parents knew it, both of the children in the film and those who looked at it. The thought may not have entered their minds. In the eyes of the average adult, this was no more sexual, so if Shirley played house. Even today, the children enter the beauty contest, many dressed up extremely mature for a three-year-old. But the child just pretends. I don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. We honestly say that our media has made a lot of things that work back, so seems to be sick and wrong. This can sometimes be the best. But I really think this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance of an innocent mentality that we have long lost.
