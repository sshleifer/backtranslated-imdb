Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri-directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belong (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) the best chambara movies. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) working for Nakadei who wants to become daymio. Okada, being "cleaner" for Nakadei is treated like a dog - and after a while he understands - what he really is about Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there's so much more in this movie - every fan of Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means the punishment of heaven)
