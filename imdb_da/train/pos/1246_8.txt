The principle may seem lumpy, but as Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mystery and modern hard-boiled child abduction. Outstanding cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy are at the height of his 80s top in comedy / action. There are also some good F / X, a very surreal dream sequence and a pretty original plot. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy flicks, but this one is worth a visit.
