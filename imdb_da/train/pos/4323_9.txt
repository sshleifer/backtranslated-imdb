This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in itself. Plot cuts can disappoint the fans of the book (but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a movie version first? I know only a few). <br /> <br /> I find it quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series, which are clearly written by people who have no idea the story - so you actually see the series or just took a BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the newer version? The series captures the mood, pace, characters and plot drivers (cut out Dickensian flourishes that are not necessary and degrade a movie processing like the Turveydrop story, the Smallweed family dynamics and the extra lawyers - Tangle, Vholes, etc. are very shortened). The only omission I would have liked to have been was the Jellyby incident, but since the first episode is already a bit slow (after the first episode, the pace is perfect) I can see it has to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jos's death could have been more faithfully done. I can see that would have practically canonized Woodcourt, and he has been a little more human in order not to have that scene, but I really believe Jos's death is one of the most pointed points in the book, and I missed it even though it always makes me cry. br /> <br /> Has theowinthrop actually seen the series? How did he think Esther was raised by his aunt and UNCLE ?? Who is this uncle? I assume that someone who could celebrate the name DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond is not really appreciated for English art (film or literature). I also think he fails to handle the law. Yes the law is much drawn in Bleak House. It fails by Jarndyce's descendants whose precious heritage is eaten by the cost of litigation, it fails the late Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and anyone who believes in the suit. It Fails Miss Float. In a way, it also fails to captain Hawdon, who is driven to his death by the monotony of copyrights. Yes it is the feed catcher of Vholes and Tangle. But it also enables men like Guppy and Kenge to move beyond their station in life. Although it was not sweet with social status climbers, Dickens would clearly have preferred that they were not bound to get stuck in the station they were born (contrast Jo and the mason's families to climb out of Charley Neckett's poverty). <br /> <br /> Also, the law, while being abused by Tulkinghorn and Chancery vultures, is the security source of the Court's Ada and Richard, and of Esther, who is simply Jarndyce's Department. Their security was secured by the law that delivers them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can't see how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember you shouldn't realize Esther is Lady Dedlock's daughter right to the beginning. Neither should you "get" all the connections immediately. Instant gratification does not happen right in Dickens. <br /> <br /> With regard to "seeing clearly" through the fog - gosh, Gillian Anderson had such scatty editing that I found impossible to follow and I knew the plot already! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg brilliant (overpowering and drama doesn't make a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they're trying the Gillian Anderson version). It's ADA and Rick not "Kate"! And you get everything you need from the Rouncewell subplot.
