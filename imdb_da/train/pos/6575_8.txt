'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest games if handled correctly and this production does a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a pre-film star, is Raina, the daughter of a military family who has a fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart) and who puts a soldier from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production tears together at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the girl are adorned with the rest of the cast, they still hold their land. Peek Markham and Dinsdale Land as the parents are lovely, and the whole game is generally a happy one. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
