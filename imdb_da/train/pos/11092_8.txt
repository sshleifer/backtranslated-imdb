52-Pick Up never got the respect it should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated but sequential plot. The actors involved provide some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are the perfect cast and provide deep character portraits. Also noteworthy is Vanity, who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career considering the unexpected ability she shows and Kelly Preston whose characters will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.
