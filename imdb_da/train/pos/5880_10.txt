On the contrary, the person mentioned above me, I felt that this movie was really fun, especially in the scenes where there was a lot of confusion. I will not give away plot and storyline to the people who have not seen it yet, but I would say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role as former Priyadarshan films, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays a tremendous role in the small role he has given, John Abraham does as well, Akshay Kumar has proven that he is no less in this movie he had from Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Although all three solid woods in this movie were on a debut, they did a great job of performing especially Nargis, who is very nice and warm. I would say that if you liked the Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is a must.
