Remarkable because of the infamous explicit scene when the beautiful Maruschka Detmer takes his young lover's penis from his pants and into his mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a fantastic, if somewhat disturbing, passionate and dazzling sexy trip. Detmer puts a great performance as the partially awful, insatiable joy that walks around her flat naked. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy, and politics. For me, the last two are slightly lost and the end is most confusing when her fiance is released while other terrorists are released, she seems uncertain who she wants, and the young lover seems more interested in her exams than anything else she cries , beautiful of course!
