The only one was a good movie. I just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional breaker, and I thought it was a good portrayal of how life is like a professional breaker. Now this movie was made 4 years before I was born, but I do not think that the rigors of professional wrestling have changed so much. Sad, fun and everywhere great !!! **** 10+
