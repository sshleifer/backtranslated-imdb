Are you a giraffe? Asks John to Nadia, and she is sure to answer well, answers him: yes. In this way, communication between a man and a woman who does not know each other, and at the same time begins the questions and doubts in "Birthday girl". A movie that I heard many times, but I dare not see ... until two hours write this. "Birthday Girl" is a passionate movie that makes me fall into count at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (except she is beautiful and intelligent) that I have ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and routine man seeking a wife on the internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be the delicate woman, normal, no more. One day, in his birthday, suddenly comes his cousin and his friend. The man begins to discover certain things. Since then he will not be the lonely and routine man who has always been. Many of us will think that this movie is only a regular with a exploited plot. Much of us will think that the action and the excitement are safe and not novel. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative plot that I had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with some fun touches is an excellent natural movie with many suggestions for movies of this kind. "Birthday Girl" has some beauty and rudeness in her scenes, but at the same time touches nature and makes it so deeper. "Birthday girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes fun, sometimes violent, but ultimately it is quite satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say that this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... yes, if anything.
