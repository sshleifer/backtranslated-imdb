This documentary explores a story covered by Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time", published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the native of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islands are technically British citizens when Diego Garcia is a British colony, just as Mauritius, the nearby island where the natives were banished, used to be. But the British government has ignored their reasons for returning to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which has used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilgers coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and current poor living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews around are excellent, and his swing of a parliamentary representative using the government's own information to pin him down is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to expose the natives. The weaving of this recording with interviews and the Icelandic music increases the effects of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "Stealing a Nation" is John Pilger's best. Recommended.
