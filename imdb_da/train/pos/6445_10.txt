In addition to the excellent direction, production, action and the predictable drama are an important message in the script: "Listening Leads All the Way" For the voice to flourish, listen. To harmonize with others in voice, listen. To be able to approach yourself, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems that the screenwriters convey a "secret of life". Listening leads to an awareness of one's self. It awakens the other senses, especially vision and expands the horizon. One's soul can also be discovered. The art film of this movie "as it is in heaven" showed the magnificence of life, not just its joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this by the lead's first instruction to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it leads all the way"
