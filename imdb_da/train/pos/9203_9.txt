This is one of the films by Dev Anand that gave big but clear films to the Hindi film industry as jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple - a brother searches for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from the jar and sang Hare Rama hare Krishna. Nevertheless, the film shows a few of the significant events that the world experienced in the 1970s. Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, refugee, family and adoption of something new as Eastern (which was new to white) religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave his best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used (as opposed to being abused for having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled. A perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka name badnam na karo'. Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it's not the essence of the movie. Overall, Devji, who believes in making various movies, has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal in the 70s.
