When you watch this movie, you begin to realize what a drastically underutilized active the late Dudley Moore was. There should be a dozen movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was already a great talent before going to Hollywood, both a comedian and a musician. But mostly he is remembered for his mating with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He always tended to be darkened by Cook, who's jealousy and weakness struck their partnership and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really nice movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The manuscript fits in perfectly with his way of many hilarious, almost surreal, conversations. There is something so British about him that I am actually surprised that he found such an appeal for American taste. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian after the same way tended to draw a plot. It is Moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent one-liners. John Guilgud especially delivers with a sarcastic and agrarian authority that is a treasure to see. He always steals any scene where he has functions and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'. It never achieves the same weird levels of fun that this one reaches, but it's still pretty good though. Guild god first gets a coma look at the beginning and as a ghost. It's darker. And there are some interesting soul searching. It will disappoint if you look at 'Arthur' first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in seedy Dudley after these two outings. He eventually returned to Britain, rejected, and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But 'Arthur' is a test of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he should have made. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Dudley missed.
