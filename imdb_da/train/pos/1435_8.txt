I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-suited, entertaining, absorbent, well-behaved and neatly directed. Nobody - even Pacino - chews nature *, tries to stand out; One of the film's most effective moments (Aielo pulls on his beloved off ramp) cools precisely because of his restraint. Not as good as, says QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye, ear and heart. Why such well-mannered entertainment flops at the cashier's office is anyone guessing. <br /> <br /> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * You know Pacino is picking it up in a particular scene, but precisely because it is required. Amazing scene too.
