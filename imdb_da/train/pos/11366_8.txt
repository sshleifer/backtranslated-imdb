An amazing and convincing drama about the hunt for the infamous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent achievement by Stephen Rea as forensic scientist responsible for the study, which finds the greatest obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, especially the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has an underlying theme on the decline of communist society, and progress in the pursuit of the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly set across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the overall views of Reas (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea itself. These are first polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in the system looking down and Rea 'low' on the ground and looking up. But they have a common cause ?? to catch the serial killer. Throughout the film, the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is trapped and glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent script. <br /> <br /> Additional credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is fantastic and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the murderer we despise but cannot hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is convincing as the humble psychologist at risk its reputation for helping.
