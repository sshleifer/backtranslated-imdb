I'm surprised at the IMDb's low rating of this movie. With high respect, the low rating is representative of the IQ level for those who rated it so poor. They would rather watch a movie with cheap tensions, a bigger budget and more. The first misconception of people is that this is a horror movie. Nor is it, the film will mislead you into believing that it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews don't make much sense. It's almost like trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare these days - is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll reveal some spoilers to the morons who said it was boring and not that doesn't make sense. Martha brainwashed herself and attempted herself to be a caring mother while she was really an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The proof is all in pudding and the fact that at first view, we sympathize with this cold blooded monster in the film's duration is a testament to the film's direction and writing. I certainly feel that this film should at least be evaluated in 6's assortment alone on originality. I recommend this movie to people at the other end of the IQ scale - aka smart people - as this movie is of course slaughtered by those who would rather see Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the actor as well. For such a low budget movie, you are surprised that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the big direction, writing and acting. Please fool yourself into IMDb. This movie is worth it. In fact, I recommend buying the movie as a first view on a rental will not do this justice.
