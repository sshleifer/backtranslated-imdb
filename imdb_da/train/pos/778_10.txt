I'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deeply. I don't think I'll forget it. A scene special (I think anyone who has seen the movie will know who I am speaking) is printed on my brain. I also looked at the corresponding film Lilja 4-ever (as mentioned by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite to the point and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, it will also bring tears to your eyes but Anjos Do Sol (Sun Angels) can stay with you forever. This is a very depressing topic, but I think no, I hope the movie will succeed in putting more emphasis on it. <br /> <br /> More people should watch this movie !!!!!!
