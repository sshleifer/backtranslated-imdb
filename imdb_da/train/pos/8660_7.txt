This is a racist movie, but worth studying and enjoying. The first time through it is the natural inclination to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed and peaceful thing, how about her still at home from college, and retired and kicked back and waited for inspiration to do something. Second time through you realize how horrible sister's husband is dissed by his friends in the backwoods blues bar. He takes it, that's what needs to be done these days, and the critical moment goes as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene, sister's blues song is a real tear if you are least sensitive and like that kind of music. Her performance feels like the highlight of history; A blues story with the good guys is "people of color" in their element of backwoods, SC. Meanwhile, all the white folk music in the movie leads what seems to be shallow meaningless lives, only to make babies. It's cold as long as you recognize it as a fiction.
