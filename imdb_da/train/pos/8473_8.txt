This fun and courageous sequel to the highly successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a follow-up in name only. Stories are found in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a presumably vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty", deep in the uninvited marshlands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweet celebrating performance with sweet, pigtailed future "Different Strokes" sitcom star Dana Plato) goes awake into the treacherous swamp to check if the creation of the local legend might be a real living being. The trio are hopelessly lost in a violent storm, and the frantic, bear-like, humongous but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the children's rescue. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's informal, non-frills direction addresses this simple story at a leisurely pace that immediately captures the rural workaday minutiae in convincingly accurate detail and draws the various country's characters with great warmth and affection and fortunately develops the feeling An organic, restrained, undisturbed way that never degenerates into sticky-bags moss. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") provides an engagingly beautiful depiction of the children's beloved working class single mom, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer a delightful irascible support as a pair of quivering oil shayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's talented, sunny film shows the woody setting of all its lavishly quiet, extremely clean and fragile unspoilt civilization splendor. Darrell Deck's scoring skill blends the crossbreeding synthesizer and the shaky banjo picking country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this image specially guarantees praise for the way in which it unexpectedly predicts the 90's kiddie function Bigfoot vogue with a good 15 year old in advance.
