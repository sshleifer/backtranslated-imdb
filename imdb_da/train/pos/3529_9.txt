Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is wrongly accused of killing his incredible wife. The night she was murdered was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him his name. After being charged with the murder, the police visited all the places he had been with her, but people only remember that he is alone. He is doomed to die, and his secretary (Ella Raines) decides to find the killer himself because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This was made as a B movie from Universal (see the cast-all-character actors and a star - Franchot Tone - falling). The budget was small and mostly unfamiliar, but what came out is one of the best movie keys in the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish (a pen name for Cornell Woolrich). It moves fast and looks just great. And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., which just comes from the screen of incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censors didn't cut it). <br /> <br /> There are few faults that prevent this from being perfect. Tone gives a terrible performance. He looks horrible, and he's just awful. Curtis is also stiff and bland as Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so unemotional. But Raines is pretty good in the lead role. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene where the killer is after her never calls right. He is hardly a threat physically, and her reactions just seem excessive. <br /> <br /> I still give this a 9. A really good movie - missing aside.
