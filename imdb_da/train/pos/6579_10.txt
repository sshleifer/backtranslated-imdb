Think the best screen version of Quo Vadis? ever made. Well, yes, it's not as strong and clear as in the book, sometimes wobbly and loses its excitement among aesthetic features. But the film is really and beautifully "strange", has a riddle and style, the other versions - with R. Taylor and the new from Poland - are definitely missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of falling paganism and infancy. At least I think it has. Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did excellent work in portraying their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the greatest success of the cast (let alone Brandauer, the biggest player ever) and accumulating the essence of this dying world (IMHO). That is it. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
