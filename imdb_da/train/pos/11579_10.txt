this film is a masterpiece of a young woman's story during the war, and it really doesn't happen like the movie, but it's a great story, i was impressed with this movie, the play and the story how big i like this movie because it is a true story, it's Giff me a feeling that I was there, and I'm sorry about the kara rector, whom Maruschka Detmer plays, because who will end here life that way. I recommend everyone has to watch this movie, especially the young ones, and learn from this movie. You can compare this movie with the movie soldier from Orange or a real story that happened in World War II.
