When I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a few years ago and was impressed with the scenery, I can't help but wishing that this movie, though having a beautiful color and a beautiful view, would have been shot in the current location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the place where the movie takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, that is, when I feel Anthony Mann who used outdoor places so well, could have done the most if he filmed in the real place. James Stewart here again is a man who fights in himself, one side of him will not get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side can just ignore people who become murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who doesn't care who she is doing, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Man is excellent looking at the sliders, but the highlight of the movie is how well he does in outdoor scenes. He uses outdoors as much as possible, and he is helped by the winter landscape, the dominant white, as it was green in "The Naked Spur" and brown in "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the preparation of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
