Greetings again from the dark. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it does not measure up to the classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in itself. The story is a little strange, and the whole wall is never really explained, but the performance is good, even building strong tension. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller) and agrees to pick her up a fallen star ... being played by the amazing Claire Danes. Not much excitement on what happens to these two, but the exciting part comes into the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the Prince's son of King Peter O'Toole seeking to regain ruby ​​necklace that our "star" is wearing. Lots of bad chases well. <br /> <br /> Along the way is a meeting with the strangest pirate (including anyone from the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard on the inside, and we must say in contact with his feminine side. Another meeting involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-talking trader, and it's good for a couple of laughs. Not your typical hunt, age or fantasy movie, but director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Kage") effort deserves an audience. Unfortunately, the poor marketing campaign is likely to prevent it from making money. My guess it will find great success on video.
