This movie was amazing. It's an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth, where director Lucy Walker brings to the movie. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the special movie that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This movie id is a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs man. The inner turmoil and victory is enormous in its subject. The topic of how Tiebtans sees blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice, as he would not normally have been heard. Thank you Lucy for being true to your vison as the filmmaker.
