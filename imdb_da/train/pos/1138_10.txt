When I was a child of 8, I always saw movies and TV that I didn't need and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies from time to time, and it must be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the play is great, they don't make comedies like this today ( movies that are actually fun and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or a type of vomiting body fluid as in the retarded Judd Apatow films that highlight unfunny non-actors such as Seth Rogen, barf). <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the acclaim.
