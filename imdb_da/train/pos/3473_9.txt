I admit that I had a certain degree of trembling when I first saw the researchers for this movie. Was the VH-1 pulled on hollow grounds here? I mean, Harris and Quinn don't really look like or even sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. It is far from the development film I was expecting. Instead, it is a character study, a low key, capricious and ultimately bittersweet to look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn: It is difficult, if not impossible, to catch what we once had and what has passed us .
