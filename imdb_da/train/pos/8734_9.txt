The movie was amazing and cool. The graphics were amazing and it was amazing. The tab was especially amazing and fantastic in the movie, and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent. Circus bugs are colorful and they are amazing in the movie. The grasshoppers were also amazing and cool in the movie. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even the dot was sweet. When the bird comes to eat bugs, the scene was amazing and good. Even the last scene was fantastic and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers. When the ants build the artificial bird, the scene was good and good, I really should appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
