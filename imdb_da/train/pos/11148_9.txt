'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand it, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed like a cowboy he is trying to live like a hustler, making money by the action of love. It doesn't work as he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money, they become friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to make some money. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably rated X for the main subject, but along the way we see some strange things. Editing in this movie is amazing. We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a good and sometimes fun way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give good performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and sounds good. All this makes this a good movie that won Best Picture Oscar for a good reason.
