I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it seemed, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, although its base in a true story, its plays are stupid and incredible. The real profit of the picture is cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30s and 40s provides a backdrop to the entertaining, intelligent work of the ever-underrated Miriam Hopkins, and Claude's amazing, spectacular performance, which, as usual, is best in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains her best work in film. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
