Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. It involves realistic events with really funny and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a crown in his pocket. He lives and performs odd jobs and travels to a new city when he is bored with his surroundings. One evening he meets Trina, a beauty of every standard that is cold and alone. She has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days, but the two are very well connected and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her so that life is rocky, but there is a true spark between the two, even though they live in a coastal river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making him easy to identify with, even though we think he behaves badly. Young is amazing in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, making her much more comfortable. Pre-code elements include lean dipping, pre-marriage pregnancy and crime.
