A boy and a girl are hunted by a local warrior because the boy killed (accidentally) the father of the warriors (or who he was). And they travel through Africa's most rugged areas. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is not as good (except for the elephant child). But it is a very good adventure and it is not very censored, there is some blood, meat and nudity (which slightly lighter the movie). <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 because of its image of African nature and it's action.
