The title got my attention, and then I wondered what comes out in the plot when we have seen so many "super people" movies this year ... and actually I really liked it, as there were a number of unusual fun scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman performed as average in G-Girl role. Surprisingly, I was again able to see her toes in the wide screen (as in the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well idiot everyday guy who meets the great woman I could really get into his situation. If you want an easy piece of fun, you should definitely look at the G-Girl's and Average Matts adventures, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
