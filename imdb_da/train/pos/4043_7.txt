Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I have noticed a lot of disappointed movie genres who loved Versus this director's debut movie or his third movie Azumi. I have heard that they are blood-drained movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of treats. Frankly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to end the wall for wall action, then Alive is not your choice. There is plenty of action, but it comes as a payout for an entire hour of character-driven construction. Personally, I think it's well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the sudden stupid things are with many SCI-Fi action movies, and I think the subtitles of the term foreign body could have replaced the parasite for greater effect. This movie is brutal when it has to be so weak of the heart, does not have to apply. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget down by mostly limiting all actions to an underground building (taking a signal from the cube) but the movie doesn't suffer for it. Another bonus for this movie is intense gothic performances made with great artistic flair under the many flashbacks and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
