A few days ago, I realized that the filmmakers in this movie put a word on words in their title. This movie is not primarily about "riding giants", but mostly about the people who are sports giants, RIDING giants, to change weight. In my teens I lived a block from Wedge, one of the world's hardest and best bodysurfing spots. I have been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have many times enjoyed riding and been hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves. This experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, for all looks a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my understanding. The first safety rule for any water sport is "Never Surf / Dive / Swim". He went where the sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks were all back. <br /> <br /> In the hot water world: The first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin lit all over my body. It's not just scary waves, it's uncontrolled gut evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only survive 40 to 60 foot waves (I can hardly write these numbers) but actually work the faces as a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders that can be compared to that of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it a 9 instead of 10 only because it neglected to mention that there are big wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserved to mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw on outside Log Cabins and a 10 is it!
