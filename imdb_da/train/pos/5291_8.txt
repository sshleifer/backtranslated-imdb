It's only been a week since I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble) and I wasn't sure what to expect the second time. <br /> <br /> While the previous movie was outrageously over the top, Pecker is actually a funny movie that satirises the art critics of New York to a T. Anyone who can't imagine what these "experts" find so appealing About modern art, will be delighted to see these pretentious snobs become so full of themselves over Pecker, a boy who has just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Doomsday) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There wasn't much meat on any of the roles in this movie, but he really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes in with another great achievement as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex and Pecker.) Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also an essential part of the movie and really made it fun. <br /> <br /> There are many fun scenes, but I have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming, "We want shrubs!" "We want shrubs!" want bushes! "I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police retrieving the dancer. <br /> <br /> I have to look for more of Waters work, especially Hairspray, now that it's in the news.
