Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like "The Shining"? There is an easy answer: Modern Directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick once showed to everyone with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and writers all the time. So it's pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliant by Jack Nicholson) and his family moves into a large, secluded hotel to watch it off the low season. The kicker is that the hotel's former caretaker murdered his wife and two girls. The following can most often be summarized by the movie's title, but you should see it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie for a very long time to beat me as "scary". These are some seriously shaken things, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scary factor is the amazing music. Music has been a big part of Kubrick's film (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few), and he does not completely disappoint with this. The score completely sets the tone and this movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is frighteningly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, his stare steals a few scenes from this movie. This is top-notch acting to be believed. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror movie that perfectly fits this one. REST IN PEACE. Stanley.
