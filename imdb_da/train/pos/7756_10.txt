I'm not sure if this is a kind of masterpiece or just blurred fluff enhanced by performances and visuals. Whatever I'm sure, I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, lurid, staggering stories, to the exquisite creepy performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the lively, shiny color that it's all trapped, it's high-class waste, and it's fun. Not to mention the entertaining dull and thin blurry sexual subtitles that permeate the entire movie, always threatening to escape from the picture into the dialogue, but never do it. I would lie if I said that the movie's pure entertainment value did not contribute to my love for it, but there is some bizarre artistry behind the unintentional (or was it?) Comedy, and I really really dug it. I could really get into this melodrama thing.
