I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was an ordinary cartoon .... except when bras and bullets began to fly. I agree this movie will make anyone and everyone disturbed because it is willing to discriminate everyone and everyone .... but the truth is that it is fun as hell as it is deep. I recommend it to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try the Fritz cat and the nine lives of Fritz the Cat. If I'm correct, Ralph Bashki also made that movie. It involves a cat who goes through hard times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title in that era, it was also labeled Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World with a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another comic book that deals with youth street art.
