Disney can just be on something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on truth that involves sports and a small town in Central America. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sporting story based on truth. Both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected to be a good feeling good type of movie. We were not let down when asked if we would buy this on DVD when it came out, it was a no-brainer. Most definitely.
