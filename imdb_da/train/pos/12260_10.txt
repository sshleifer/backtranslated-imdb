This is an excellent start to the movie career Mickey Rooney. His talents show here that there is a long career ahead of him. The car and cargo tickets are exciting for the 1937 era. This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual. Please Mr. Rooney or the owners of the movie rights, take a chance and get it produced on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
