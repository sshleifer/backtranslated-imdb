From the author of "What Happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this tail-end of the sixties horror cycle has something creepy and campy fun. Micheál Macliammóir makes a Victor Buono-type bit, but too often the film hits dangerously close to a poor musical ... there's a particularly horrible child's recital about halfway through. Debbie cranes, tangos and tricks on one lay Harlow, while Winter's religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her. Agnes Moorehead checks in as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
