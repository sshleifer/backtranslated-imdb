This was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. Frankly, even these adjectives just can't describe it. I can't just pick a scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I were to list a few, it would be the firefighter's reactions to the bounce's crashed sound; The reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who did not know what was going on when they finally came to the terrible scene; the spectators shock and disbelief and finally the silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and even now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: "I felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of voices suddenly shouted in terror and suddenly became silent." It is amazing how it is so precisely in the description. There was really a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary apparently shows this disturbance. The feelings are so incredibly visual. The anger, the frustration, the shock, the fear, the exhaustion and the realization of its great strength. That's all there. It is not something that is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and most moving documentary and worthy of Emmy. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it is simply everything it needs to be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to see, be sure to grab a box of tissue. You need them. I know I did.
