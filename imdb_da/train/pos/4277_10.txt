"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with very profound implications for the fate of mankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very ordinary and ordinary people from a godly Serbian province just before the beginning of World War II. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance of getting over that side. It's such a shame that this excellent movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - couldn't find anyone. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of film making for a suggestion of ways to buy a copy.
