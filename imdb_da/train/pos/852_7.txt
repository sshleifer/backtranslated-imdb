THE MATADOR is hit-man movie a little .... if you can say that about a hit-man movie. Violence is never really shown, but often introduced. In the beginning I was afraid I was in for another retread of the mid 90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy, but was fortunate to be surprised when I realized this was just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this movie, but every part of it is being kept laughing at me. The three leaders have the best chemistry offered by the big screen in recent years, and it seems they had a good time to make this movie together. The script is sharp, although at times it felt as if the manuscript had been adapted from a stage play because of the set dialogue scenes. This is a good movie, which I probably can't remember for long, but at that time it was a complete joy. Good movie.
