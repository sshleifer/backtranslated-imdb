I don't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung make cinema on a cleaner level than Claire Denis. That said, I do not love this here her latest movie, as much as her 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it comes very close), which in itself is one of my absolute favorite films. It is only because the story here is perhaps a little too elliptical for its own good. Don't make me wrong, the fact that this movie hardly has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it about a degree longer than it was necessary to go, and consequently, the film flirts with incomprehensibility, and a few key points must have been clarified somehow (so the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there suddenly without any explanation of where he is or why he Is there). Also, some of the other characters seemed unnecessary, and as if they were just excuses for Denis being able to use actors, she may again suffer (Beatrice Dalle's character is particularly distracting because you expect her to have a show importance). Still, the film is incredibly absorbent, and cinematography is amazing. It is certainly a great masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis' more highly acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French instructor at this time, better than Leo's Carax himself. I must also admit that the South Korean sequence really makes "Lost in Translation" better than the movie itself does (and I am, unlike some, a big fan of that movie).
