I simply never get to see FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra so I was involved from the start. Has kept in touch with Jon and has helped promote the film both in cinemas and now the DVD release. Even in the scope of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various locations throughout France. FREEBIRD was professionally written and aimed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus castings. Only Phil Daniels could take care of Grouch's role. Great privilege to meet Jon and throw at the party after the premiere in January. Something else you want, Jon just ask, either email or phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
