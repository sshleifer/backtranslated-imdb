I saw the movie and couldn't really stop my tears. Its tragedy that India does not have such leaders of freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi 'What kind of society do we want to create / do with such people (about Harilal)?' No wonder it will be a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that "After 50 years, one would hardly believe that such a person with body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth." I sincerely thank Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all film actors / actresses for this wonderful movie about big person and relationship with his son, every father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
