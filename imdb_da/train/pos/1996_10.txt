Simply put Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's filled with memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" just to name a few - and just as memorable characters. <br /> <br /> movies are a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel and much like the story of Oliver Twist himself, it's a perfect family movie. There are some scary moments - the villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is scary enough on his own - but in general, the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults. The story - which almost everyone is familiar with now - is about a little orphan boy called olives and his life grows up in London. First, he lives in the workshop with the rest of his accomplices, but after daring to ask questions to Mr Bumble, the supervisor, he is sold to a serving family. After a series of mishaps and close shaves, he meets Artful Dodger - the excellent game of a young Jack Wild, giving his hero in the role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody) who trains young boys to choose pocket treasures that he sticks to. <br /> <br /> The film was shot exclusively in studies and on soundtracks at Shepperton Film Studios, but it doesn't translate at all into movies. The sets perfectly replicate Victorian London, just like the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a great success on his release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all the time and will delight anyone who loves movies.
