Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a good screen crew and it could be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, keeping your husband can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what I love about the movie. I love to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are simply wonderful. It is obvious that they are really good at working together and that is part of what makes this a wonderful movie. The witty dialogue, amazing script and attention to detail are the other things that make this so good movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and on every subsequent show I always notice at least one new detail. For me, this is a sign of a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period (early 30s). I offer classic movies, but I admit that most of them are only average and sometimes do not hold my interest. Keeping your husband is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with keeping your husband a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays code was not enforced until one year after Keep your husband.) This movie could not be made under the code. Well, it could have been made, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God the code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise we would have missed this gem.
