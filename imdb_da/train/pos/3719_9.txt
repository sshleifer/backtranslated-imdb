Just caught it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story, told in a compelling way. The handheld camera access to action scenes is added to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not a Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a large budget to produce a gripping movie. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor focusing on the events of the movie Boz.
