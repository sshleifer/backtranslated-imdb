I really enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, and this movie only emphasizes it. She depicts a housewife in an African-American family moving up the social chain because of her husband's (Danny Glover) success as a lawyer. She moves to a completely white neighborhood, where the people are friendly, though slightly awkward to her. The various events that occur during the film make for some laughs, but mostly appeal to the other feelings. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I strongly recommend that you catch it on TV or rent it soon.
