This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing actual recordings of important events in the failed coup to form Chavez, we get the background image describing a class-shared society. Many of the rich seem to have a choice of people's democratic elections and are willing to use the military to change the regime. "Beware of what you say in front of your servants" is a revealing comment. The head of the country's largest oil company is calling itself the new president, with US support, and these young Irish film producers have it all on camera. A great movie to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent evidence of how media can be manipulated and force used for the sake of big business for the interests of the people's democratic desires. Riveting things.
