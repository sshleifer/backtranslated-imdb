'One-Round' Jack Sander is called it because he is a carnival boxer who fights someone in the audience. If they can hold a round, they win a prize - a popular way to draw customers in travel shows a long time ago. Jack is in love with the maid, Mabel, even though her head turns quickly when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his luck with Jack. What nobody knows about the game is that Bob is the champion so he can beat Jack - even if it takes him some work. As a result, Bob Jack asks to become his sparring partner and abandon carnival circuits. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly he works his way up the rankings until he is almost ready to take Champ. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel are starting to drive behind Jack's back - even though Mabel has now married Jack. So when the final match occurs between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will Rising Sound Wrath Against Bob Help Or Prevent His Performance? Tune in and see. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and today this kind of movie looks strange to a director known for mystery thrillers, back in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre, which he directed or wrote (he did both to this movie). In fact, this film is in many ways more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style when a similar plot appeared in one of his next silents, THE MANXMAN (also contributing Carl Brisson as the wrong man). So even though it looks like a standard boxing movie today, it was not a radical departure for this amazing instructor - even with its rather formal change. All in all, while a bit predictable and getting Ian Hunter to play a boxing champion seems silly, the movie works well. Although it is far from a perfectly silent, it is well worth seeing and packing a good punch.
