I notice that the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between posting the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF except for the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene is like during their failure at the simulation, Kevin Joaquin gets clamped down. <br /> <br /> I think the VHS edition except the ABC can have all the missing stuff. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I would like to know which DVD release is missing the missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD I've seen feels edited for television.
