I just read the plot overview and it's the worst I've ever read. It does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the note on "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a toddler. My sister and I could not wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse films of that time. It is one of the great classics that the whole family can see. The romance is clean and endearing. The story is interesting and the songs are good. They don't make movies like this anymore. Good play and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best with many other great character players.
