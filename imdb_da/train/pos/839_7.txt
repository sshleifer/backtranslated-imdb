Think Pierce Brosnan and you think suave, brave, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against type - and has fun doing it (like the audience). This is a movie about a hired assassin turning to a harried businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with very good scenes (a nosy Brosnan and a good, compatible "off" edge Kinnear has some good lines). My only cavil is that Hope Davis plays the oh-so-tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Doesn't appear more often: she could have been a wonderful foil to these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience while "goes to a killing". The end is great because a story (with a positive morale!) Pops up: This is a frantic, hectic and fun movie that deserves a wide audience.
