dear god where do i start this is bar no the best movie i've ever seen. The camera's angles are good, but in my opinion the play was the best. why the screenwriters of this movie do not write big budget films, I will never understand. another is cast. it is well. This is the best ted raimi movie out there for sure. I know some of you out there probably think "no way he has much better" but not your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. I hope it will have Goten's best movie of the year instead of the crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors. I think this movie is really the most wonderful thing ever.
