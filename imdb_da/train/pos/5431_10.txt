I've seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I can't help but be entertained by it. Gunga Din is one of the classic films made in Hollywood's Golden Years, as the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on amazing special effects and man-made "monsters" to carry a scene. The screen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is suberb and very entertaining to see. The tongue and cheek's attitude, where the three actors play their roles, seems beutifully and flawlessly. Some may consider it "corny", but I consider it "classic" movie recording and performance at its best. One should remember when looking at this movie that Europe was involved in a war with Germany, and the audience went to the cinema to escape the war graves and be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil. Swing Din achieves this perfectly by letting the audience laugh even through the actors during their hard escapades. In short, it's a classic movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't want the audience to.
