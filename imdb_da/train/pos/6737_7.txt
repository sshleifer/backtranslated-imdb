The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were reteamed for this solid politician: Dana Andrews is a criminal's son who becomes a policeman to cut all ties to the past, but cannot control his inherited violent ways while interrogating suspects and, one night he goes too far Gene Tierney is the alienated wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has been involved in the city's leading racketeer and Andrews no. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who himself had been the prosthesis to Andrew's Snr.)! As usual at Preminger, this is a well-crafted film with a remarkable opening sequence and enlivened by a good cast, which also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' superior superior), Tom Tully (as Tierney's mouth-taxi driver) and Neville Brand ( as Merrill's top chew, with remarkable support, also comes from Craig Stevens (like the slimy, wife-born victim), Bert Freed (as Andrew's sympathetic partner), and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrew's high outgoing superiors). When he had already been warned by the latter to rectify his ways or other, Andrews pleads and mimics Stevens for a few hours after his murder to put police on (in this case) wrong traces of Merrill; However, after Tully becomes the first suspect (when Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the police alone goes into Merrill's lair, fully intending to be hit and "hit" the racket for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character, and Andrews rises to the challenge of a first-class characterization, which is typically complemented by the internal Fox noir style.
