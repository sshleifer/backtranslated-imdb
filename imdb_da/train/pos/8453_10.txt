I could write a big enough comment on one of the characters in the Gundam Wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 good leads that lead us through 49 golden episodes of Anime Bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains dialogue that you can roll around for months ... years, and then go back to and derive New meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (though it has the typical Anime features of there is a difference between subtitles and English dubs. It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the cold, distinguished men and loving female characters is an independent aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are happy to see. The apparent rejection of the cock is supported by an inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) by the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. The women chopper aspects of the men, which we rarely, if at all, see, making the leading men the more enigmatic. It takes Heero all the 49 episodes to show some care, but he comes there and when he does, it's a big pay. <br /> <br /> And then there's the huge robot battle. Fun to watch amazing sequences as well as any Hollywood epic battle scene. Any smaller clued up person would see gigantic robot battles as a silly cartoon feature for kids as it has become clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are mistaken. Many of the gigantic robot battles in the Gundam Wing contain a massive dose of patches, usually involving young rebels struggling for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. The constant shift in tone and weight Through each episode, the Gundam Wing makes it impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought-provoking study of the human mind and human potential.
