I like my Ronald Colman dashing and debonair, the fellow you see in movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A rolling Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in a double life just because his role as actor Anthony John is so unfortunate for him, Colman was recognized with a best actor Oscar for 1947. It became his best known part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes the method quite seriously. He's just finished a successful race in a comedy of manners, and he's right the jovial guy. For a change in pace now that the game has completed its Broadway round, Colman is bringing a revival of Othello to New York. If just opposite a part that you can get. <br /> <br /> His leading lady in both is his former wife Signe Hasso, who loves him deeply, but can't change his mood when he's at work. Colman also loves her and wants her back. But he is on his way to a mental breakdown when he begins to confuse himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with his role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as a poor waitress, who a depressed Colman picks up, gets in the way of his madness and she wins up as poor Desdemona in the play. Killed the same way, and now it's a question for murder consultant Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that you do something weird, is this a professional danger with actors? I would shake to think about it if there were unresolved murders in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, they wrote Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never really buy the story for that reason, but I certainly welcome Ronald Colman and what he did with that part. I'm sure there was a regret about him winning the Oscar, but because one of the other nominees was his good friend, William Powell for the life with father. Others during that year were Gregory Peck for the Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Sadness being Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman gets support from the rest of the game, including Edmond O 'Brien, who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealousy imagination. Still, you won't find any Iago equivalent in a double life, no one who challenges the jealousy, that's all in his own mind. And that from one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
