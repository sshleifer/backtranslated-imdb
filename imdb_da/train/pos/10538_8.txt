I work on a movie store and as such I am always looking for an excellent movie. I decided to check Nothing like it was in our Canadian section and I have tried to support my country's film industry. I was in a surprise. The movie features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that seems to dive into so much of our minds and relationships ... without working so hard. It is consistently comical through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some fun exchanges ("We can't be dead, we have cable!"). What more can I say without noticing that it's worth a shot even if you surrender it within the first half an hour.
