Well, this can be one of the funniest movies all the time, and Sandy gives a turn-the-force performance! Alas, her career never took off, but finally she will always be remembered for her three top-notch images: "The King of Comics", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". She falls into different personas from the New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a bitter and fun criticism of the folk culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she is actually "really beautiful". See this one (if you are not from Iowa), you will definitely enjoy it !!
