I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason. Maybe it's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, lots of unpleasant words with bathroom humor thrown in? I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie. <br /> <br /> Falks plays and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating. <Br /> <br /> This can be a great movie for adult kids to watch and laugh at their own people and their foibles. But the lack of consideration for audience families seriously destroys what might have been a family movie, but fails. Certainly not worth spending money on, although it might be worth watching a watch for free on TV.
