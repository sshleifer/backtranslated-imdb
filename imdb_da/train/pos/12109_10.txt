Yaitate !! Japan is a great fun show and I really like it! It was shown in our country recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5.30. It's about Azuma Kazuma, who tries to fulfill her dream of making Japanese bread that will represent her country. He works in the southern Toyo department of Pantasia and he also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They struggle with other skilled bakers from many other countries and learn not only to make different kinds of bread, but also to learn to cook. It's a really fun and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is truly a must-see for people of different ages.
