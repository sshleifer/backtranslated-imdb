The Japanese cyber-punk movies have never really done much to me, but most of the handsome I've seen have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. The meatball machine is no exception. The story is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts, take control of their bodies, turn them into "necroborgs," and cause them to fight each other for the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of parasites. The film is mainly about a shy guy and gal who fall to each other, but whose love affair is shortened because they are both infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will vs. The control of the parasites over their physical body ... MEATBALL MACHINE will always be compared to TETSUO (as most cyber-punk films are) and for good reason. There are certainly some thematic parallels, although the films are completely different. There are lots of fun, splattery moments in MEATBALL MACHINE, and the creature / castle FX is definitely the highlight - a blend of TETSUO meets GWAR, both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE can be your thing. If you enjoy hyperkinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of splatter - this is for you ... 7/10
