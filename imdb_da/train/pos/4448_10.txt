Saw this movie yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a student of screenwriting, and I loved the way the little characters intervened, just when something pivotal / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the background of history is pretty shocking - at some point Barbara Stanwyck is openly pleased with her daughter's boyfriend; And revive some passion in her husband, which she hasn't seen in ten years; And with the shot "two shots and then one" she hangs along with her old shag mate Dutch (the reason she left town in the first place!) EVERY TIME! The moral majority must have been absolutely scary when they saw this girl back in the 50s. <br /> <br /> Love costumes and movies and from the hip dialogue - just to see Barbara Stanwyck and Co do 'Bunny' Hug 'is good enough reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies from the period I've seen for a long time.
