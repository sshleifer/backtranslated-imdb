I liked this movie a lot. I rented this expecting something not so bad to spend an evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie that was not supposed to be just a stupid slapstick comedy, but with some meaning and moral values. It controls both counts. The wires are all good, but especially the guy who stars, also wrote and produced the film. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were sympathetic and made me break what happens to them in the end, which says a lot. The scripture is smart and involves and has a refreshing sense of it. I think you won't be disappointed to see this.
