This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim in Connecticut. The reason is pretty thin. What drives the movie are the characters that are played excellently by most unknown actors. Standouts in cast are Brewster as a high school teacher who experiences marriage problems, and Weixler as a casino dealer who measures as a stripper. The two actresses provide natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature debut for author Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the story moving at a fast cut. Movie title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a wonderful little comedy drama.
