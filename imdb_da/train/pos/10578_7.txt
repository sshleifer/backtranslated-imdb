"Footlight Parade" is just one of several wonderful clear musicals, like Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to avert depression. The "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced in this age and they literally laid millions of Americans forgetting their problems for a while and enjoyed themselves. While most of the films produced had Joan Blondell's great talents, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in the most original dance style, with his arms usually lowered by his side, and his legs make all types of angles and kicks. It is easy to see that he enjoys himself and it makes us enjoy him more. While almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the movie, they are well awaited. I think this movie was made just before the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit of a scam. But that's all in fun. No matter what the movie is, just know there are lots of laughs and a superlative cast. In addition to those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is on his flustered best here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
