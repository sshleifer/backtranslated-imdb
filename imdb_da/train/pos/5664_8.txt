I really like this show. I can easily see how it achieved cult status. It is original and thoughtful. For some reason, however, I have never felt that kind of resonance from what I could have. It does not pack the kind of open door, the winter chill that should be from such a fantastic premise. Every time I look at an episode, I find myself immersing myself and pushing on to answer any nameless, formless question. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion and my only opinion. Different lines for different people. I would have liked to see several scenes in "American Gothic" that were shot at night. There is too much daylight in this show and I think it tends to discourage tension. We are not afraid of daylight. We're worried about what's in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see is often the most frightening. <br /> <br /> Other - and that's what will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a huge talented actor ... a character actor. I've been following her career from The Brady Bunch movie on why it hurts me to say he's probably mistaken for Lucas Buck. He is almost for petroichan, who also likes to be the practice of evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic drug. He's heroin. He frees himself in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of Drain-O. You keep going back even though you know the end will be madness and death. He should be like the ultimate loan shark. He is a creator of book, but also of invisible condemnation. Of course. You have money, and for a long time you also have broken fingers; a cut off hand, a decapitated head and finally a cursed soul. Turning to Buck is a desperation, and when he is around, there must be an immediate, surrounding finality - with interest increased daily - in the air. It's pretty much all strings attached and when you realize it, you'll also know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to three: they showed Buck a little too often. In fact, he is in most scenes, who may have caused him to lose his edge. The sheriff would be like the next door mythology. He is the apocryphal acquaintance. Many would know 'of' him, but only one unfortunate couple would really know him. He would be thrilled with flashbacks and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot show would have been the deputy character portrayed by Nick Searcy. <br/> <br /> Four, the show could be very self-respecting - for a mistake, some may say - and this is characterized by the whistle of "Meet Me At The Fishing Hole" in the series pilot. I think we have already stated that what Cassidy and Raimi shot for was anti-Andy Taylor. We probably do not need the concept that was delivered to us via Fed Ex. I collected it within the first five minutes, so for me the piano was upside down unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> These remarks are about what would have made a great show for me. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup. In their eternal pursuit of LCD programming, the network played a crucial role in the decline of this series. The least these jerk-off packages could have been was to move the episodes in order. <Br /> <br /> Get it right. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it's a massive loss for both genre refiners and casual viewers.
