This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas are repeated by Mamet, but never told so briefly. It's really about the lack of trust, the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Does anyone live today who hasn't seen this in our own society every single day? The film is very structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed, and everyone is participating in con. Could something be more true? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.
