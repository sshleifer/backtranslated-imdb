Another excellent movie that thoroughly trounces the endless crop of crud coming from Hollywood! This is a story of life and living. No, certainly not the perfect little life so often depicted in the completely artificial Hollywood movies, but real life complete with real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses, like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined within this bathhouse's walls, and especially its old owner, are magnificent, heart-warming and very thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and take you away in the simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom learned in this movie if you only open yourself for it. You will not be disappointed.
