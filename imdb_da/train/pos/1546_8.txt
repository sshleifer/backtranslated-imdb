I watched this movie once in or close to the release year 36 years ago (1969). Although I can only remember a bit of it now, I long to see it again. The parts I remember rightly or wrongly include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some unpleasant sexual favors on the back of a closed truck to get military information from him. The music score was especially memorable and emotions gazed in the league Gone With The Wind and I would love to hear it again. There must be some commercial or copyright why this movie is not available. Someone knows why? I doubt anything to do with lack of quality or interest.
