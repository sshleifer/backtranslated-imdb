Honestly, when I saw this movie many years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial expression and comic demeanor make me shake my head about why he hasn't been in several comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing that goes to him, but much, much more talent ... doesn't take anything away from Marty. The movie really shocked me about how close it was to the original Jerk, but then it was so much more. I really think if this movie was released first and I saw Steve Martin movie 2, I think the 2nd was a cheap rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but that's true. I really like Steve Martin a lot, but his performance is 2nd to the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I encourage you to see it if you can find it.
