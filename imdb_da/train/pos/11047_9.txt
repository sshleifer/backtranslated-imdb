I had been waiting for some years before this movie was finally released in England, but in many ways was very pleased when I finally saw it. There are many great things for the movie to start acting. It's not something I need so much in a horror picture, but the people in this movie put everything in fine work. This and the constantly gripping and interesting script, with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel it, gives the film a really solid backbone. Add here the doses of surreal nightmare pictures and occasionally gruesome gore and the movies a winner. It has my favorite kind of make too, supernatural and splattery. Also, the characters in Marcus, the evil bodybuilding transsexuals and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / playgrounds are sometimes really freakish and unnerving, and giving a long way out, everything goes towards morbid adult craziness, which works well with the frequent freudian overtones. This is one of the most impressive latest horror movies, much more shocking or out there than Hollywood can produce. My only gripe was that I wanted the end to be darker in tone, but it still works so I would really recommend this for serious horror buffs.
