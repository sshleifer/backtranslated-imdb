I first saw this movie 40 years ago at N.Y. TV, and thought it was a depressing look to the future. Wells sees the restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. ("no private aircraft". The 30-year war in the movie was the reason why this film was not shown to British filmmakers to make the war. The concept of the future and the Korda et Co. concept for the machines in the future are the real stars of the movie The Best The performance is Ralph Richardson's Boss, a combination of Winston Churchill and Edina of the Absolut Fabulous Comedy Series, and it is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality resembles some of Churchill's war.
