When my current age daughter was in preschool, these miniseries arrived at A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a covenant that we would not miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice. I had forgotten how much I loved this movie until I first got out of my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, shaken face, the monstrous behavior that was tempered by humor and tenderness were from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a small landscape, I couldn't sit through a fitting with starring Wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught in the romance. <br /> <br /> I would love to know what has become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead as Jane, quiet, formula and says volumes with a look. The spark in her eyes gave the viewers a glimpse of the strength and the sprouted nature that helped Jane survive the abuse she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as "tree" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained such behavior, but she speaks passionately when he overcomes emotions. Unlike many other Janes screens, she seems to be Jane enough to give the audience the opportunity to buy Rochester's attraction for her. <br /> <br /> Bronte dialogue is a big part of why the book continues the script holds much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with white and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as ordinary and sweet as vanilla service, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leaders play each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect fit of the best Romanesque novel ever.
