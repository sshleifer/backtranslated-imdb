This is a sublime piece of film making. It flows at just the right pace all the way through. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very comfortable for the ear. The humorous parts are fun and made even more of the film's largely depressing tragic character. <br /> <br /> But despite much comment on history's built-in tragedy, it was anything but depressing for me to see. I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way I haven't experienced for a long time. That is, it is fantastic and yet without all the common traps of modern films like; gender, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'In Real Life', nothing is missing out on the ordinary burdens. It has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require and would actually be ruined by any additional decor. At the same time, the theme is completely adult. It is a work of art in itself that encapsulates you completely and you will no more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a little 'Waltons', but they actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. The roser makes room for the tragic, which then gives way to the idyllic one that turns to the darker, etc. This rolling landscape of emotional film creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and troughs are gentle, but more than adequate for the pleasure they bring. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie no matter what genre you usually enjoy. Put away any prejudices because this is a must see!
