True, the book does not follow very closely, but it is still a very entertaining take on the story. Swayze was far better than expected. And Doody avoided the "stupid woman out of her depth in the desert" image, most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in the "Indiana Jones & Doom Temple"). At least, it's incredibly better than Richard Chamberlain's horrible couple of Quatermain flicks. It is very much like a Western in many ways. About the only thing I didn't care about was all mystique, but I think it's part of the genre. Like "how can you have an African fairy tale story with no witch doctrines and preternaturally wise migratory tribesmen?" Heh.
