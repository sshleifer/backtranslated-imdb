In the hands of smaller actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this movie could have become stupid and thin. But with these two experienced thespians who lead the way, I found "Silent Fury" to be a most exciting and enjoyable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger claiming that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man at that wedding, one can feel that there is some kind of plot against her in the workplace. As Colbert, Ryan and her lawyer set out to disprove the alien demands for a previous marriage, they are met at every turn of more evidence that seems to strengthen the assertion that she has actually already been married. Although it is not very difficult to find out what the most important "baddie" is, it is still very fun as history's intensity and pace increase. All in all, a good, solid mystery movie with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine support cast that includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
