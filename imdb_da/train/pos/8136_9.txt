This movie is a great documentary. It follows the rap group, NWH, which consists of ice cold, tasteful taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap heights, low and back to heights. Through problems with women, egos, police and whitey, this group comes to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of documentaries. I know everybodies favorite mocumentary is This is Spinal Tap, for very good reason, but I think if it is in the right mood, this movie is simply better. I am a white guy who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else related to it, but I love this movie. . Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the manuscript, the songs and the star in it showed great potential, and it's a shame that I haven't seen him since Fear of a Black Hat. However, I have seen him once more than you have, and that is why I recommend fear of a black hat to you for a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot to see white! .... of their eyes? No shoot to you see the whites."
