Barbara Stanwyck as a really hard cookie, a waitress to the working class (and prostitute in her father) flying to New York City and using her feminine wiles to get a filing job, on to Mortgage and Escrow and later as assistant secretary to the other on command at the bank. Dramatic study of a female character who is not afraid to be indecent has not lost her power over the years, when Barbara behaves a storm (portrays a woman who learns to be a first-class actress herself). Parlaying a little Nietzschean philosophy into her shaken life, this lady throws out feelings okay, but she never loses our fascination, our awe. She is an ordinary, hard-boiled broad, but she is not a bitch, nor is she a man-eating or female-hate. This gal is all to herself, and when we wait for her to finally learn about real values ​​in life, her journey up and down provides the state of success of heated, sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) does well in an early role as an assistant in the file office, although all the supporting players are pretty good. *** from ****
