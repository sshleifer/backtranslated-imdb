Yes, Shakespeare would actually have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not the best but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His scheming was wonderful as his toying with the audience. Very nice work. <br /> <br /> There was sometimes too little drama where more would have been expected. For example, Cassio's slaying was somewhat confused by too much incident far apart, causing the spectator to twist his head to understand everything. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness stroked Roderigo was unusual; annoying though. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Othello before, see this. If you haven't read Othello, see this. If you haven't heard Othello, see this. On the other hand, you do yourself a favor by reading it as it acted on stage and heard it also sung.
