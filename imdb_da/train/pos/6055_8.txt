I didn't expect much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and fun and very well observed. The central trio of deadbeat cyclists was surprisingly sympathetic as they staggered and cleaved their way through their drug-centered trip to Wales. The humor was gentle and subtle, like the three figures (testifying to their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady). The atmosphere in rural Wales was captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Gently and carefully written, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic depiction of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about motorcyclists and fabrics. A joy on all fronts, and hard to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit paralyzed - the movie had to be completed when they left Wales. But in general, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
