Yes, it's low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's earliest movies, but maybe it's his funniest movie! John Candy was not so far removed from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you don't jump up when Candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while he's handcuffed to a fledged cohort in having sex with his boyfriend with only the apartment door separating them (huh ?, watch the movie!) Or the way, Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) speaks to his mother on the phone, or just the myriad of facial expressions that only Candy could give you better, check your heart rate! If you like John Candy of "Only The Lonely", this may not be a movie I would advise you to watch, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV days, this movie is a must see!
