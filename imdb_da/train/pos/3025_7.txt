Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. This is often overshadowed by the fact that it falls between 2 major successes: "Having and not having" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both of which linked her to Humphrey Bogart. Granted this is not up to the other movie, but I do not believe for my own sake. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper crust lady. No accent at all. I think all the weird accents were distracting - Boyer was definitely no Spaniard. It was hard to hold on to which country people were from. <br /> <br /> I really liked the black and white filmography. Mood is used to great influence - I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also does a good job of adding to intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just beautiful. Boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading male role for me - so he and Bacall together were a little weird. Not good chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I really liked this picture. There is great excitement and it moves well enough. I must say that I found the murder of the little girl brave for this period film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporters. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely vicious and evil in her portrayal. Her a scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji leaves after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. Lorre also does quite well in its slimy snake image of Conteras - a shabby sweep to the end. Wanda Bendrix also likes to portray the child Else - especially as this was her first picture, and she was only 16 at that time (although she seems much younger). Shown she was later married to Auie Murphy, who turned out to be a short-lived, outrageous marriage.
