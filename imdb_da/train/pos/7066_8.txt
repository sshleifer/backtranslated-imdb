This movie is so old, I never understood how young people watch Ray Milland in 1936, I remember him playing in a big movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very rich banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy with their father and mother, and they find out that their father is getting married to a young blonde who is a gold digger seeking only a rich girl. They employ a man to be a very rich count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer), full of time and barren, giving lots of comics throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at a police station and told the police officer that she was an opera star, and then Penny began singing with the most amazing soprano voice I heard, the entire police and prisoners began applauding, which was a very entertaining and fun scene from this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first film debut, and she became an instant success during the night and continued to become a fantastic movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
