Viewed during WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a fun fantasy adventure for children staring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch, with the help of three evacuated children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft', counteracting a Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Brilliant inventive, with many laughs, this movie will delight children of all ages with its beautiful characters, exciting history and captivating melodies. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not perfect witch who takes the three kids on the adventure of life, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Soon and Ian Weighill) are as impressive as Cockney rascals who helps fight for the unpleasant Hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's see, the kids don't care about these things as long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some stunning scenes brilliantly blending live action and animation into great power and more real movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, it is only a quite pronounced song set in Portobello Road, and the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, it can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> In addition, any movie with British television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiver is guaranteed a good rating from me.
