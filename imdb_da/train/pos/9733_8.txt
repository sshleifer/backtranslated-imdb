"How to Lose Friends and Aliens People" is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill out the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic core is the same as the book with certain events dramatized, but a romantic plot is added and the end is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, in spite of playing an essentially annoying person, is his usual cozy and fun self and basically wears the film. Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a television sitcom guy and now he rubs shoulders with Hollywood names. There is a good supporting casting and it is a fun, light guard - kind of male 'Ugly Betty', but more fun.
