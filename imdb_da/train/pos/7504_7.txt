Hey guys I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until I saw a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the protagonist's son. It was a great experience and I loved every minute of it. While filming, they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger that presses the radio button in the car is not mine. I still shop and do some TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, I'm called the first on top of the roll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was okay, but if I wasn't in it, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. I thought the play was really good, but the story was just uneven.
