While it was a pleasant enough musical, it was the unexpected comic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, which he has been a composer and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high-strung, distracted artistic type (far from his more familiar roles as either threatening villains or the cool logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character looks as though he could not find his way out of bed without help. And the help is Starbuck, played with his usual droll humor by Oscar Levant. By hiring Crosby's character as his ghost writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, "He does all my thinking for me." As Levant responds, "Oh, it's just a part-time job." Of course, it goes straight past (or over) Rathbone, who is too busy to tell where his next hit song comes from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so much fun! Too bad he didn't have more opportunities to show off his comic talent.
