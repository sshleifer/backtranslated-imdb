I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children in that age group and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5 year old. I didn't think the comment was necessary and actually lowered my opinion of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is up and coming star. I'd like to see more of him on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations he found himself in. Often children in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences. Almost all the actors did this throughout the film. I also believe that the message of bullying must be investigated more in films with this age group. It's a big problem in schools today. The end was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts on whether he won or did not win the game were very surprising. How he handled that situation was excellent. Too often today, children are not willing to compromise. The actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life.
