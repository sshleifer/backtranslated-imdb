Although I have great respect for Disney's animated movies, they have not been what I would call "must-see" in the end. Atlantis looked exciting from the first movie poster and trailer, and happily lived up to my expectations. Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for a Disney movie) and is more focused on action and discovery than any other new Disney offer. The Atlantis world, hidden beneath the earth's core, is amazing, presented as deserted caves with ruins, and slowly evolves into actual ecosystems, which, while normally containing some reminder of hardness, become increasingly exciting until the tropical paradise even reached. The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting, with no consuming, cheerful song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and exciting look. The inclusion of an Atlantic language as well as attempts to connect it to the mythology of the ancient civilizations of real life adds to this and seems quite good. <br /> <br /> Except for some scenes involving Mole's handy jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis when the Milo outsider was able to learn everything he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlantic to discover parts of their own story they didn't know about. Part of this involves the Atlantic "weapon" which is used in a very action-packed climax which, for lack of a better word, is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Giving it, not the whole story makes full sense, the movie has no amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but apart from the Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen this year.
