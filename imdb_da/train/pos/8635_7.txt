"California" is a good Hollywoodish odyssey of excitement and terror that tells of two couples running cross-country to California to share the price of gas: A few losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer ( Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good look at them for the psycho-killer flix.
