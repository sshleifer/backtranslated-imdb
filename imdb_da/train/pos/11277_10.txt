Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men are looking for ivory and taking Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - a sequel that's better than the original. "Tarzan, The Ape Man" from 1932 was good, but had some terrible special effects and some kind of draws. This has much better effects and is much more adult. There are tons of overt racism (a black man is shot to death who is empty - and no one really cares), but it was 1934. There are also lots of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and unknown prints Jane has made a long underwater swim completely naked! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane carry almost nothing and (it is implied) they sleep together and have sex - without being married. It wouldn't disturb anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> It's also really right, very quickly moved and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in the skimpy lion cloth is definitely a treat for the eyes and Jane's outfit is also quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is ok. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. GOOD WORTH, but not for kids!
