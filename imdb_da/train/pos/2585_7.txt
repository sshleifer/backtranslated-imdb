Here is a rare gem for those of you who haven't seen or probably haven't even heard of this. In the 80s Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he blasted back on the big screen with three films, all of which unfortunately bombarded. Two of the movies I liked a lot and let me elaborate on one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy girl of two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard) are ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for something that is not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother burst an abandoned house that killed a man that was inside unknown to them. Today, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the brutal Vida (Debra Winger) who is under house arrest for guessing what, arson (see the movie to understand better). Wilder also did not talk to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for entertainment. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When the carnival arrives at Wilders Town, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see Vida, who Wallace has been in love with! Wide house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is busy. So, Wallace enters and the mother begins. Brother vs brother ... fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some good fireballs throw in this flick ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The movie also has some really weird but fun elements that Wilder's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefighting and departments. Jim Varney (globally known as 'Ernest') emerges as Wallace's redneck carnival buddy. "Wilder Napalm" is excellent shot ... and wisely composed ... very away from the wall and avant-guard. <br /> <br /> Give this a look ...
