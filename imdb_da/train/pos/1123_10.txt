I really enjoyed this and even though the end made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four fellow girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) drive down to Florida in the way they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really didn't add anything to the plot, but at least something sympathetic. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for fun, but they have car issues and never do it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three remain at the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, one of the girls will use the bathroom, be in the middle of the sky, where she has no choice but to walk in the bushes. Soon she witnesses as a man (March) strangling a woman, in fear flies the girl the area, she does not go very far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> Her friends at the car look for her, they also go into the forest and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man reacts by shooting the girls head, the other girl running away, manage to get it back to the car where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station is arrested. This is when I started to get angry, these poor girls are afraid of their lives, and the redneck police don't believe in them. <br /> <br /> They are being treated poorly and one of them is left alone for the evil to kill her in the cell manages the remaining friend to escape but not without getting into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene mimicking Psycho, graphic violence against women and solid history. Some women will probably find the offensive and sensitive people will NOT like the end, but everywhere this is a great little unknown movie.
