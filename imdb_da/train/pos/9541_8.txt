Wow baby, this is actually some fine Asian horror / gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. This is a Japanese splatter party that reminded me a little about Tetsuo, except in this case of all blood and gut, there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning movie with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, make them a sub-machine, or I think cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human being, they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. This will probably be called industrial splatter or something, with a great soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also borrows a bit from Carpenter's "The Thing" in the design and effects of the closet. I would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. And a must-have for stoners, because you don't even have to read the subtitles, the visual images alone are enough for a mind turn. The design of the small creatures that inhabit the human body as a fetus reminded me a little about Frank Henenlotter's film, which is another tribute to some excellent gorilla movies with a sense of humor. The "Meatball Machine" is fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it and I just loved it.
