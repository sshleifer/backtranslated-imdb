Steven Rea plays a forensic scientist at work in Soviet Russia in 1982. In the very first hours of his job, a body of a murdered girl is placed. He has his workers go back to search for evidence, and they bring back five more bodies. This starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in today's history. It is a sharp, depressing, dark film examining how the bureaucracy of the old Soviet Union indirectly contributed or caused many of the killers. It also explores in Donald Sutherland's character how the proper use of bureaucracy in a communist government can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster. A gripping movie not for everyone, but for those who like a good detective story that will keep your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten.
