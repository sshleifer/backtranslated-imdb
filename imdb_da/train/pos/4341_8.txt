Who doesn't have unresolved issues with the parents? And what parents don't have unresolved issues with each other? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds heavy. But this is played by laughs in the movie, which makes both comedy better and drama better. I always looked like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star qualities could be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted by the very first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries that his son makes about his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a hardworking, inexperienced father and husband was the perfect point of balance. Without the stage working so well, the film would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
