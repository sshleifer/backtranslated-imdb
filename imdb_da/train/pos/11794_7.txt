This is quite the gripping, fascinating, tragic story. Pretty well, and mostly quite accurate, considering it's a television movie instead of a documentary. They created some fictional characters and combine several real people into one character, but otherwise it is a good story of a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> The last moments in the movie showing the suicide / murder mass murder are almost taken from a sound recording by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of Peoples Temple existence. It is available in several places on the Internet. This part of the movie is almost the place in that respect. <br /> <br /> In summary, a documentary is not. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the People's Temple story.
