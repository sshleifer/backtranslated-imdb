Action, horror, sci-fi, exploitation director Fred Olen Ray shows that he has some talent as director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best hard / bad in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best performance of his career. With regard to Randy Travis, he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression. He's not bad in the movie. Smith and travis make the film As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stands out. Ray did a good job of managing this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B Western on a scale of one to ten (ten are the best) one seven.
