This movie was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta's beliefs brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie had come out in late 1988, Hulce instead of Rain would have been nominated for a best actor Oscar. Definitely a must-see!
