I've never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this movie on a clean slate. And I have to say I enjoyed it completely. Sure, some of Sondre Locke's plays made me a little bad - but hey, it was the 80s. But even if you can't get past her (and I almost couldn't) or her assassination (which seemed a little ... overdone; P), it's just worth it for Dirty Harry. Or at least call the bull dog lovingly 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
