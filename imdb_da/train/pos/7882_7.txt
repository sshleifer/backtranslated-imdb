"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to show the MGM talent. The movie is a fun ride on an ocean liner heading to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time of the Second World War. This was typical fare for studios that gave the film public lightweight entertainment as a distraction in the difficult times the country lived. The beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in some musical tracks where she clearly shows us that she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen in an equal part with not too much clowning when he pursues the beautiful Ms Powell on the ship, bringing them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show that he was a fun man. Also Virginia Gray is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good music tracks with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, where one sees, among other things, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has a couple of solos with Mr Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the band's lead singer, supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic trip that should taste the fans of this genre that the MGM completely controlled.
