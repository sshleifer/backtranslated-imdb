Stephen King movie is a fun thing with me. I really love them or I scare them. Some of the more advanced productions (like Desperation and Storm of the Century) I did not enjoy. Some of the smaller ones I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one I really enjoy and watch it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story is about Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleep migrants, form-changing creatures, which, although human as in appearance, change into a cat as a creature. They are immune to the scrub's scratch, and when they move to a new city, you have to put out traps to catch and kill the animals. When moving to their latest city, they must seek a virgin, and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed her to stop her strength. The story is about what will happen to the girl. Will Charles save her or use her to save her mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has overtones of incest that some may find unappealing, it actually plays a role in history and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, it is based in a small town with many interesting characters. The action is not the best, nor the special effects, but somehow it all tends to "gel" and is very reliable and enjoyable adaptation. <br /> <br /> For British readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
