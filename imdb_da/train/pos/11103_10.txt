"The Godfather" of television, but apart from it's recognition and mobster characters, the two are not the same. Tony Sopran is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist teaches that Tony is actually part of two families - in a family he is a loving father, but not as perfect a man, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi, that Toni's problems actually originated from his mother Livia, who is suspected of having borderline diseases. Gandolfini is legally praised as the main character; but Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as recognized for their equal and talented performances as psychiatrist and mother respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are praised for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and locking. Chianese, the only recurring actor who has actually appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Ton's children are "okay" but not remarkable (with the exception of Iler's great performance in the third to last episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are convincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong to hold it back. Although the show continues for over six years, it ceases to be boring or predictable. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
