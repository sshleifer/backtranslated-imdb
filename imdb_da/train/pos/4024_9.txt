I was very fond of this movie. It kept me guessing until just before the end what would happen. One of the better movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on the partition. It is a little less common than Gadar, and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start with an opinion on what's going on and going right out on one side. This is not typical bollywood fare, but rather an art-house type movie. The best part of this movie is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on someone else's story. It does not blame or castigate, but instead lets you draw your own conclusions on things.
