* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticism (action, dated dialogue, fuzzy history) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a brandosque, threatening, debilitating spirit that will serve its wings, but is realistically weakly equipped from its previous life to do so. He learns too late when emptied his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is also great as an attacked man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds characters represent alternatively collide and complement each other, the result is hilarious and soothing sad. The confusing end is actually quite consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a descending feather, and he comes boldly to it as if he is finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to end his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith) so he never got his wings. The spring flows out of Mostel's understanding, a metaphor for both men's lives: it's too late, and you don't get a chance. Like "It's a Wonderful Life," this movie is magical, wonderful, fun but terribly tragic.
