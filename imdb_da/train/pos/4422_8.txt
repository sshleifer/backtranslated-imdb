Well, if you are one of the Katana movie nuts (like me), you will surely appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood-spitting samurai action flick. Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heikis clan versus the Genjis clan touches the transmitter in the final showdown on the Gojo Bridge. The body count is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions of maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese girl for a rainy summer night.
