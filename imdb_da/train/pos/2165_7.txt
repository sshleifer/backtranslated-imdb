Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are so rarity when you come together as "Impulse", it's something to embrace. Scripture is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton provide credible performances. This could have played like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far better than any boring "zombie party" and the originality shines through in almost every scene. You get the feeling that something like this could have happened even if the script is pure fiction. From the "grabber" opening to the credits rolls, you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - NOTE
