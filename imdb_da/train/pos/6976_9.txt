I haven't seen BSG, I tried to see it once in the middle of the show, but couldn't get into it. But I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday, I felt a little lost, so I decided to see the pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think it's a promising show, and the only side effect it had on me is that I want to see BSG now. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I didn't have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what's happening in Caprica. From what I read in the net, they tried to reach the female population, as BSG reached far more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> But I suggest that if you try to watch the show do it from the beginning with the pilot.
