Four prisoners share a single cell: the dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus idiot savant friend, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who wants to eat something in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy caught in business scams and now focused on escape. After a brick falls from the cell wall, the men discover the hidden journal written by a "Fountain of Youth" obsessed serial killer who recorded the cell in the 1920s. Is this magazine the secret to their escape? Or is there something much more scary behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this movie because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I consider to be the worst theater movie I have ever seen. But much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be due to Klavan's horrible script, because (as I remember) Valette's direction was not the worst part about the movie (unless he chose to include the child). Anyway, Maléfique was a great way to get my respect back. . . It's a French movie (of course, something I like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favorite horror posture for asylum). So there are two points for him before the movie itself starts. Luckily, Valette had me when the movie ended too. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complicated, rather convincing story of obsession and desperation. . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. Although it is not a scary movie in the traditional sense, it makes the unevenness of its power frighteningly frightening. The period between climax and conclusion was some of the best movies I've seen for some time, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A little respect gained by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount picked up the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). That's due in 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something would be a great moneymaker here in the states. But I've been surprised before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
