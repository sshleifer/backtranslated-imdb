I had heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw that he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on without knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams ever was. He has total control over the audience; When he does 'Englebert is dead - no he is not' routine, the audience does not know what to think at the end. God like James Mason is also an inspired mark, and his version of the Pythonic Spanish Inquisition as performed by England's Church - 'Cake or Death?' is invaluable. My jaws became pain of laughter before the end of the show. We scoured the TV lists months after that to see him again, and were fortunate enough to tie him the next time he came. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tie it down, you won't be disappointed.
