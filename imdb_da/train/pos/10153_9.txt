I caught this movie by a test screening. Was very surprised to find a really cute and fun story. Well done. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead was awsome. Very funny movie. Find the place in the best places in New York. Made me want to go there. I just watched "You have mail" I thought "It was you" was a much better story. Friesians. It was clean and good for the whole family. I think it will work well. Target group I saw it with loved one. A definite recommend!
