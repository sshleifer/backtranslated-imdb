When Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in television history, it was a prior conclusion that I should go to the cinema and spend $ 15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a leak that a secret service agent plans to kill the president. As the study unfolds, it seems that the only likely candidate is the high-profile Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading innocence, Pete goes on the fun, fleeting style, to search for the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but it makes me feel a bit empty, but you could definitely do much worse.
