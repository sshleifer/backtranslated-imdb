"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first draw lengths, 3-striped Technicolor films. To fix a previous poster, the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusive deal) was 1935's "Becky Sharp", which was a costume drama that used the color of the colored suit. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" looks as though it could have been shot years later, as cinematography not only uses the color but also the use of shadows. It must have been great for an audience at that time to see a color function after having seen basically only black and white films for their entire life. Unfortunately, the film is not up to the cinematography. That said, the film is worth looking at as a visual treat.
