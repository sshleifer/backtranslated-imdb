Being a huge monster fan, seeing me the "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg' market, I was able to find a copy quite easily, and was fortunately surprised to see that this flick was actually dare I say decent. Decent for what it is, actually, a cheesy giant monster flick. It kicks quite quickly, as the Yeti is found almost immediately, and we are introduced to various figures. They consist of some blurry, some good and a girl who is pretty much one of the most straightforwardly striking beautiful girls in a cheesy sci-fi movie. The Yeti looks like a long-haired guy right out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he's not that bad for a guy, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he does not even make a rampage (in fact he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but just looks just amazed while trying to figure things out. The Yeti seems to understand English quite nicely (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good guys and the bad are. <br /> <br /> But we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing and he is pretty much the whole movie and in typical low budget style he seems to change the size very much depending on the stage and there is even a bunch of "fake leg "shot of him just standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are certainly some good ones here. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another he uses windows in a building as "ladder steps" to climb down from the top of it - crushing each window with his foot and often shocking the residents inside - In a sequence that really looks very much better than it should be in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never stands as low as saying "APE" does. In fact, the only time it even comes close to true silliness is when the pretty girl gets the Yeti's breast tissue upright and he lifts his eyebrows in an "oh yeah baby" way. But even that is not so bad, and it is also a bit laughing at the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty long after this kind of thing, but surprisingly it doesn't get boring - that story is really good and just seeing this beautiful actress on the screen will make every male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> The "Yeti" may not be in the top echelon of giant monster flicks, but it's definitely better than other King Kong '76 rip-offs like "APE" and "Queen Kong" by very far.
