This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie or a well-made movie. This is a landmark within the art of animation, and although it wasn't, only the technical skill was about doing it. It would give it a place in the animation story. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props such as posters and bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, much to a grasshopper's chagrin; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the flake. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds that Mrs Beetle has her own affair. Mr. Beetle chases the lover away, but forgives his wife. The two make and go to the cinema. And the movie they see is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. Described thus, it sounds banal, but when it does, it becomes a poignant work with the cinema. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented almost everything that future animators would use in their work. Therefore, he must not remain forgotten.
