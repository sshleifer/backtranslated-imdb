This is one of the movies that you didn't want before - so you could see it again "for the first time". Van Your books still bring joy - but are termed too flourishing by many. This movie is by far the best movie adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - no more. The reason is complicated. The story goes too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
