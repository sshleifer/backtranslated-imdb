If your idea of ​​a thriller is cargo, explosions and dozens of people being knocked down by a gunfire, then House of Games is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and excitement then watch it all. <br /> <br /> The "House of Games" tells the story of a recognized psychologist and author, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and becomes involved in the shady world of con but led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). Saying something more about the plot would ruin the excitement. Frankly, I find it hard to believe in anyone who says they saw the terms that come. Like a smart designer, this film draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance. The story is tight and well-worded, the dialogue smart and laconic, the play uniformly good (Mantegna is excellent charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse so physically unattractive. Men Dr. Ford must be cold and secluded; moreover, her homeliness is in some way crucial to the plot (at one point I think an injury to her sexual self-esteem is an important part of her motivation ... I say no more). <br /> <br /> The "House of Games" is a dark look on the underside of human nature that concludes with an unpleasant ambiguity. It will keep your attention every second while you look and stay with you for a long time afterwards.
