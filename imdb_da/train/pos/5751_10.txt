What can I say about this movie? I've seen it quite a few times since the first time when I was about 6. I've seen the English version, and it is done very well. It is a great movie for all ages, but it is more aimed at children. I love the childish humor and appreciate it. If you haven't seen it, try renting a copy, you won't be disappointed!
