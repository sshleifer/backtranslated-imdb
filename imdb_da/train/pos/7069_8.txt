It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenager. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story presented a lovely 14-year-old Deanna, a little beauty with a beautiful voice, like "Miss Fixit" in a family divided by divorce. See also other IMDb records, but Deanna and her two older sisters are planning to travel to America quickly from Switzerland to prevent their father from marrying again. With an excellent supportive cast especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the film succeeds in captivating one even after subsequent viewing. Of Deanna's three songs, only "Il Bacio" is from the classic repertoire, but when she sings it at the police station's scene, the film's place in history is assured. At least it was for this viewer, who at the age of 15 was beaten for life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many beautiful handshakes that arises throughout three chic chores is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching in the neck for a last glimpse of Deanna as the police force him by! An unfortunate result of the success of this movie was that subsequent Durbin vehicle authors were locked into the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did. Her style as an actress is more dubious than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other film perspectives, she replaced "naturalness" for the histrionic ability she lacked. Ploy worked well for 21 feature films.
