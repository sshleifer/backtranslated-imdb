This is a strange movie for me, which, after reviewing a fine movie by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), contacted another author / director, Ryan Jafri, asking me to watch and review his movie THE CURE. I don't usually search movies this way, but what heck - I love shorts and couldn't wait to see another. <br /> <br /> Interesting, as it turned out, I liked THE CURE, I wasn't thrilled and let Jafri know. To his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway - giving it my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The movie has a tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction goes, it's unique - especially for such an inexperienced movie maker (it's his first movie). The combination of extraordinary color, pacing and music choices to suit the movie created a great sense of atmosphere. You are really drawn into the movie and it is a credit to the film production. But what I didn't love was some of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was just too easy to predict. I would really love the end if it were as a surprise or there to be an unexpected twist. But given that this movie is from a person who should not be able to make such a professional film with his experience, it is good for his future. Good work.
