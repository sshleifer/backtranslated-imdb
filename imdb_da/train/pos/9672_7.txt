I know I know: it's childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered a lot of "mishaps" and still hasn't lost its faith in humanity and his sense of humor. What's special about this movie is the fact that the protagonist is the Paulie parrot - and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actors. In addition, I like the story: Paulie tells his lifestyle to a cleaner at the time he hit the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pescis!). And of course, Cheech Marin is the man's humor to me. Ever since I looked "up in smoke" I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a fun one .. can't help myself.
