I am usually not compelled to write a review for a movie, but the only comment on this movie so far is quite unreasonable, so I feel I need to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as it says in the theater I saw it, "Fallen") follows Matiss, a lone Latvian archivist when he tries to learn about a woman he didn't try to stop from jumping out of a bridge, as well as her reasons for doing so. It is plotted in a nutshell, but this film is not affected by the story as much as it is in portraying the blame to a man who has not acted. As a detective investigating the incident, he usually tells us we don't care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until they die. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will most likely abound in any review you read about "Krisana." The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and rigorous style and the story of "Blowup" is evident, and in fact, the author / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that movie in scenes where Matiss is trying to know the woman who jumped off the bridge, or in at least who he thinks did. <br /> <br /> The only other person who shares his or her views on the movie, degrades the movie and the movie's "college movie class". He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints faced by an existentialist Latvian film, but the atmospheric black and white filmography and ambient sound succeed at an artistic level to depict the loneliness of Matiss. The background sound of wind and street sounds gives an eerie aura and resembles a Fellini movie, whether it was Kelemen's intention. The film authorities undoubtedly had little money, but this limitation was used for the benefit of the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a sign study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-worthy. It could easily have fallen into a mystery story, but it avoids it and becomes an intelligent movie about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned with plot, this movie and its end may frustrate you. Otherwise, take the time to get engaged by it. It is worth seeking out.
