Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson, who tells her to change a room of a family or her father dies. The reason she needs to change rooms is because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> It's a great thrill movie because Lisa is trying several ways to escape this trick created by Jackson. The whole story is great, and I thought they could have spent a little more time on the plane. There could be more to the plane, but apart from that, the whole movie was pretty good. I especially liked the end because it was cardiac arrest. I didn't know what would happen, and I was surprised. For me, this movie just took off.
