Unfortunately not available on DVD yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is mistakenly accused of murder and courageously takes on many dangerous signs in an attempt to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleys, none of which will mention! The jazz band sequence, where our heroine seeks information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being on a very low budget and made during World War II in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks something mountainous - this is a movie with original style and unique vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew a lot about these cases and threw the most sensitive women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who emigrants moved to Hollywood and brought a very original fresh vision to them. Unfortunately, Ella Raines was never given so much again and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
