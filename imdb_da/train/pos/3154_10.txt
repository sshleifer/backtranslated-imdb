This show is freaking fun! The jokes are original, god and I love Eric and Kelso! yes i know what they say, after the 8th time it's no fun anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy compares to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can't take the funniest characters and change them with "I'm a cool guy" kind of guy (Randy). It's not his fault anyway, but the authors try to keep the 8th season fun, it's still not as much as the previous seasons, but it's okay. circle, red is a real kind of mentally abusive father :) and kitty is always half high half pie. Hyde is trying to be cool all the time, he also has his moments. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Dumbass!
