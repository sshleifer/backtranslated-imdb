This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you get a kick out of this. Think that "Dave" has gone South American as Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between jobs chosen by the island's country leader of Parador's secret police, to replace drunk dictator Alfons Simms after having had a heart attack and died . Noah bumbles together, helped in his role by the ex-dictator's mistress as they try to counteract Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also makes a look like a cordial American emigrant who turns out to be the CIA. Also with Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are a few absurd moments, such as The body of the old dictator is kept frozen for a year, and the final scene where Sonia Braga, who has carried the bloody, spherical body Dreyfus, is seen moments later all in pristine white, with nary a mess on her. But all in all, it's a big drum.
