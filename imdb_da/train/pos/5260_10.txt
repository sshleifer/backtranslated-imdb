Yes it can be foggy and can't seem as fun as many high budget comedies out there, but this movie is really fun if you really see it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as fun out of the Saturday Night Live show. When he wanted to make this character on the show, I would blow up laughs. So after I saw this play on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out. All in all, I was very impressed with this movie because it wasn't supposed to win any Oscars or be a comedy of the year, but it entertained Saturday Night Live fans who love the Ladies Man character. This film is also filled with some noticeable lines that can be recited in the coming years.
