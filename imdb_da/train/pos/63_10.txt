This movie is so misunderstood that it is not even fun. If you are thinking of seeing this for the shootings, stay free. One deals with the effects and trauma that survivors have to endure. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all make ... why? Great plays from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are influenced by the same things we are affected by. Yes the language is hard at times, but it fits well with the characters well. There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The big issues are being dealt with, and this film makes a big statement on how we all adults feel after such great incidents. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
