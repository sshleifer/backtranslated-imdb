I still have grainy, late night, non-cable, cheap VHS dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back then, sennat advertising and all that I wanted to quit no matter how strange the hour they would release this show - just so I could lose it. The series wasn't really about Freddy Kreuger - only the first few episodes involved him as anything but a Rod Serling-esquire announcer. Instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional horror themes of horrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From an episode where a teenage boy accidentally says "I'll love you forever" to the wrong girl and stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together. .) to the one where a young flight attendant goes home with a strange man, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses, and one I only vaguely remember which comparing blind dates to hockey ( and the injuries and penalties that come with) absolutely the frightening thing in the series. <br /> <br /> An episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza trader with a tasty new secret ingredient. Not original but still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> Still, some of the episodes were great. My personal favorite was "It's a miserable life" where a young man is trapped in his parent's burger-joint when he wants to go to college. Stack speaks to itself and makes small doll shows with old cheeseburgers - until a late night when a strange guy comes through the drive and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a tough one with a gun - turns out the whole line of thinking is just that - the last thoughts that pass through the child's head ... along with a ball. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of Freddie's Nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded but not killed in the drive-city, and who is taken to the "hospital from heck" - they pat all the most creepy hospital nightmares and saw some - from accidentally sewing your mouth - or waking up during an operation - getting your dead boyfriend trying to lure you in the lamb room for a little fuck. /> <br /> Again it was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were much more stupid, just like almost everybody they made available on video. They put the crumbs out as representatives of the series, and then no one likes them, the show stunk, and then they no longer put on video. It's a miserable life only available on PAL DVD in England - but I still want to buy it.
