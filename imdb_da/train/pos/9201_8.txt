Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (sister) grows up in a wealthy environment, but it is not enough to get her to reject her life and eventually join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs. Prashant (brother), on the other hand, grows up in a less affluent environment, but grows up to be a matured gentleman. The story indicates that Prashant is making an effort to save his little sister (who is always in trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film is the time test and comments that cultures and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they are to stand up and be counted in adversity. Great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people, and the director creates a creepy feeling to it.
