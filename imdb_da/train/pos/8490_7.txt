I recently watched this movie in my International Business class. I didn't expect anything but another dull documentary (not to say, I don't love documentaries. I just have great luck with movies in that class.) Imagine my surprise as this movie, actually a movie, came up. <br /> <br /> This film tells all cultural differences in the workplace and how to work together to get anywhere. The cultural collapse shows how different the world is, and how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes together and gives us a wake-up call. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone in business or just wanting a laugh because yes it is fun. <br /> <br /> Well, it's about it! Bowl
