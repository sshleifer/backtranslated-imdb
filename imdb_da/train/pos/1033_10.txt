Say what you want about schmaltz. A beauty in this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality that some Americans are called to a high end and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people with noble purposes. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the movie is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, "We've been shaken out of magnolias." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring the hallmarks of the worst people led us to the level of 9/11 killers to seek bloodthirsty revenge. It cannot all be blamed on Mr Bush - after all, we got him to lead us in that direction and re-elected him after his lies had been postponed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are spoiled all over the world. Today we see this film with a new consciousness: That the Nazi rise in Germany was not due to a fault in the German character, but a mistake in people who allow us to rationalize everything that will justify our committing immoral and hideous acts. I don't compare George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But I point out how a leader can whip us into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the extortionist who will do what has to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like our country's leaders, those who support them, and those who have buried them heads so deep in the sand that they can't even be bothered by voting. A movie like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once hoped to be - a strength to improve humanity - and that we have it in us again to strive to lift goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
