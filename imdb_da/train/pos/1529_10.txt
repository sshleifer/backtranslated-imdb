Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I see regularly on television now. The way in which all the protagonists have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows, where they concentrate on one or two people per. Episode and everyone else is pushed to the side. The way the brain of the field works is also so unclear that you never really know what he is thinking and if you think you do, you are wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murders have tackled a wide variety of topics, not just in cases, but in each of the characters' personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> What about old people? I'm 24 !! I don't think I can be classed as old yet. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when to release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can see them all in order. They seem to do so with many other programs from the same era, so they can hurry up!
