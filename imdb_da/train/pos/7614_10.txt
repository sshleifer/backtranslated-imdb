I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. I'm on Season 2, Slice 5, and I tell you that I'm also attached to the characters now. For all that is bad to happen to them would have a serious impact on my vote for the show. And Michael is on my list now. Fun ... I'm so happy to see that there is a season 3 because I was too scared to go to disk 6 and thought it would end. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers and the actors of Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before I lost, I was acidifying through all the channels in bed and sad because of my disappointment in television, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
