If the themes from The Girl From Missouri are familiar, it should. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that movie, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of funds. <br /> <br /> And it's men who mean Jean Harlow is after. She leaves the chain store, run by her mother and grandfather, because she has decided that the best way to make life easy is to marry it. Her talents as rude are limited, but she will be able to act on that beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey starts with her and friend Patsy Kelly gets an invitation to perform at a party thrown by the millionaire Lewis Stone. But unbeknownst to Jean, Stone just has a wild last fling before he does himself because of the money he owes not owning. Yet she cheats a few bullets from him, as another millionaire Lionel Barrymore notes. <br /> <br /> Lionel is entertained by it until Jean puts his sights on his playboy son, Franchot Tone. Then he is not amused and he seems to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. The girl from Missouri went into production in the midst of the adaptation of The Code, so it went under peculiar censorship. I have a feeling that we would have seen a lot more risqu√© movie. Still Jean Harlow as a younger and sassier version of Mae West is always appreciated. What a great cartoon character the woman had and see The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the big loss the movie's world is continuing to pass three years later. Ironically, the casting of Patsy Kelly with Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful shorts Kelly made with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same light chemistry that Patsy had with Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in a freak accident / suicide / murder that no satisfactory explanation has ever been given. <br /> <br /> Don't miss The Girl From Missouri, it's bright and sweet, must be from all the sparkling jewelry.
