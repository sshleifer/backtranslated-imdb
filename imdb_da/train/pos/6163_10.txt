This is one of the few films in which I consider the film reproduction as an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting, and the musical figures are undoubtedly unique. I adored the cyclic rendition of 'The Old Home Guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques, which, however, dated did not detract from the charm of the play. The background for World War II worked well and was not omitted when the movie started, which often happens in evacue stories. An often overvalued movie gives it no end to pleasure for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the whole text is neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
