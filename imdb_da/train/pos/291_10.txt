Zombie Chronicles is nothing to shout about, it's obviously not an award winning movie, but it's an entertaining B movie directed by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, who was another entertaining low budget flick. The action is bad as most cheaply made movies, but that's what makes it more entertaining, zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, gore is also big and rough, the movie is like a zombie version of Tales from the crypt, when we get two stories about zombie collections in the woods, the stories are fun and let you guess especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles are much better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget B movies or cheap made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles.
