Ya. That's what I think. Of course it was still a good show with John in it, but personally I think it's far better without it. <br /> <br /> I love having CJ and Grandpa at the house because they are so funny together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I didn't laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It is too bad that no more is being done. (I don't think ...) because I would love to see some new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character should be Rory. poor Rory is almost always omitted. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Honestly this is a good show, and to anyone who has never seen it, go see it. I almost guarantee you will laugh. well even chuckle.
