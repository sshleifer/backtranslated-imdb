I saw Insomniac's nightmare not long ago for the first time and I have to say that I really found it to be quite good. If you're a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you'll love it. The hollow film takes place inside his mind - or does it? The action of everyone else is a little hasty and shaken, and some of the scenes can be cut down, but ultimately it works. The extras on the DVD are as big as the movie, if not bigger for those Dom fans. It has tons of honest moments from the set, outtakes and a good interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through making an independent movie will love to see Tess (the director), Judge and everyone else on the very small, close personal set trying to slam this little trippy creepy movie. It was pretty comfortable, and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
