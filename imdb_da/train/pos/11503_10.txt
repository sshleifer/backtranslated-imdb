Chess chess is pure entertainment. Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. Darren McGavin provides an energetic performance that draws the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most leading players can only dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and enlistment to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Terror of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a boyhood spent Kolchak, Chris Carter drove to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
