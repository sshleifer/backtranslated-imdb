Outside, the household is another world, and the family is struggling to step in between Dad's authority and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> Period is captured; The bakelite candle swithes, the Georgian carpet, the picture rails, the wall paper, the short skirts, the naughty lads, the mini-habit, the shiny modern flaws .... The location is trapped; A wind-beaten glacier fence rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, fraud, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenthood are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This movie is an abundantly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevant today as ever. The fact that some of these are not handled directly is testament in itself to today's attitudes, but the fact that they are here all is a testament to the working skill, history, and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything bad about this movie, it is that all this deeply anchored and wonderfully stretched tension is slightly removed towards the end. Perhaps I misunderstand - the sentence and gloom followed by many teenagers really disappear if they handle it (**) - perhaps the film also tries to send the same message - it's worth doing. is the movie trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents also struggle, everyone makes mistakes, all teachers, things change, struggle can end up happily. Parents: Don't try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> Does it sound simplified or not? Sometimes the film feels like this, but it is so that you notice how much is being challenged and uncovered. <br /> <br /> The movie is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems are them.
