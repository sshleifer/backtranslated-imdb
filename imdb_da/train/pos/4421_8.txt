Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema that takes very creative directors, editors and photographers and works on historical themes what the Japanese call "period pieces". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, though. The new wave of Japanese samurai films gives a glimpse of traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult forces that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I want to place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave of Japanese instructors. Other recent Japanese pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
