For a long time I haven't seen such a beautiful animated function. When I have healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or another movie made by them cannot be compared to this. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are great, the background environment is thought-provoking, almost every object in each frame is drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt tingling in the back - so much I loved what I saw. The reason is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the animated movie plot may be. The characters are lovable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, peasants, rocks and rules! The other char-s are also very good. The humor is front. <br /> <br /> Generally, it seemed that creators did not invest much in this. I think it looked like it didn't take too much difference from people from Pixar & Dreamworks trying hard every time to think about something new. And I'm very happy that a product from a European animation studio turned out to be so great. They have made a magnificent, moving film, such an eye and heart. <br /> <br /> The only minus is stupid beginning and therefore it is 9of10 not 10/10
