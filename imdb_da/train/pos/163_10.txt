Former director Tom Kiesche turns into a winning movie in a destiny, a dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget but had the taste of the early Coen brother's movie Blood Simple ... and throw some Monty Python aromas to boot! Need to look more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry a scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this author-instructor.
