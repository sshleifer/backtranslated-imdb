The fourth man (Paul Verhoeven - Holland 1983). <br /> <br /> A movie based on a novella by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. It is rather surprising, as Reve basically needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist, and excitement is the last thing I think of when reading his work. "The fourth man" is top-heavy on the symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally very concerned with proving something for the most part hostile critics, and I am never sure what exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an infinite way, he differs quickly from the original idea or story, and almost seems to forget what to see on the screen and what to omit. In "The Fourth Man" he is not so explicitly elaborating on the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there are plenty), but as in most of his films, he seems to be afraid of the audience would not get it and hammer home the story of open symbolism mixed with some probably shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or full frontal nudity, most of it so annoyingly free and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, when you are able to handle Verhoeven's straightforward satirical approach, it is sometimes an entertaining thriller with some exciting plot twists and good performances, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√©. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
