Even though it is far beyond the target audience, I have always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so of course I was fascinated by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. This is not a bad movie. The central mystery involving a long-dead actress is presented in simple simplified terms with the danger of the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audiences are not disturbed. What I really appreciated by the story was the final results were quite serious and meaningful, and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we are back in another mystery.
