I've seen this show since I was 14 and I've loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just fun! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and more fun every day, and my favorite part is when Benny always has her last comment on George after every stroke of his fat giant head. * Laughing * I would laugh, and I would see it with my friends at home it would be as if we were watching a funny movie but short. Love George Lopez. Fun, talented, fun, spectacular. This is a fun fun family comedy series that is fun for everyone and you will surely enjoy it - I did! And if you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you start seeing because you won't stop seeing it. Although there are no new episodes, I still enjoy the re-run. Still fun. Never wear off. <br /> <br /> 9/10
