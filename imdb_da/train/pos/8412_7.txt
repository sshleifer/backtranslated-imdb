Those who participate in the film camera so early in the century must have discovered a potential very early. This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and accidentally sells his soul to Satan for much money. Unfortunately, the soul is double, and he must often confront him, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people who fade out and of course the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the Faustian story is always in view. One thing I must mention is the general incoherence of the people in the film. Also, they were very much away from much action, which would at least have given life to the cause. I was first made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. I was not disappointed.
