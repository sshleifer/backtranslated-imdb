Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God is destroying his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error in his ways. Of course, giving the powers of God might be a turn to worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home when God and the cast bring the plot together well. The witnesses are almost always on target, although they sometimes do a little too much on Carry's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film actually portrayed God, not just that, but also as a black man. I thought it pretty well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, such as the opening cake scene for example, others miss the target a little, but still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
