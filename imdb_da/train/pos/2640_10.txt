Obviously, not many people have seen this movie because no one is posting more comments. This is not a movie to miss. After all, it has won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Prize. Paul Winfield should have won a prize for his amazing performance in this movie. Eugene Logan, who co-authored this for television films, was also part of another film about humanity or the loss of it by being the technical advisor to Truman Capote's movie Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will send another letter telling how it was that Eugene Logan became the technical advisor for a movie of such a wonderful person as Truman Capote. Thanks for reading this and I hope you will find a way to watch these two movies.
