For quite some time in my life, I didn't like this movie either, or I liked this movie, but not as much as many more. I saw it recently (by a sleeper, funny enough) and I liked it more than I had since I was under 6 or something. I now appreciate it more as I do with some other Disney classics I've seen recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or anyway you spell it). <br /> <br /> Now, I greatly appreciate the animation, the clever "Disney" plot, the humor of the mice, the expressions and the plot. The animation is very well done, often you think you are where the other characters are, see them. The animation also makes it good to portray the styles behind the backgrounds, including the city (which appears twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original adventure in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot views that the mice do the clothes and the body (usually I don't like Disney movies if they are not the original story, but with "I don't worry, I feel they've made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie. I often don't think Disney changed the book well in some of their movies." <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her horrible grandmother and stressist. She goes to a ball using her fairy godmother and loses a slider ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is very much to be seen with other people. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend that you see it with friends (and closest family if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little bit, people who like adventure and for people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
