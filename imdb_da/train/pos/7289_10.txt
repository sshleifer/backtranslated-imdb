This was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 at the time. It scared me well! But that night I put gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother got very sad. She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW IT IS A MOVIE! Hello for the time being a good movie. That the head is sitting on the laboratory table was just as right as it came then. And if your 5 it is very scary! Kids one day are pampered by special effects that show too much and leave nothing to your mind's imagination. Your mind can imagine things that are more frightening than special effects! (IMO)
