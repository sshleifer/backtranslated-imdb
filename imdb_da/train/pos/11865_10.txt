I heard some friends one day say that "Scarface sucks ... an idiot tried to make another godfather in the early 80s." Now I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN, so I decided to stay away from it. Then my buddy gave me the DVD and said, "This is # 1 with the pelicans," confused, I tried it. This is the best movie ever made. It is more realistic than all this stuff to drive cars that are too expensive, for anyone in that area can afford (* cough 2Fast2Furiouscough *) However, there is some humor though Pelicang and Light 80s music. Still, what's better than Al Pacino with an m203? I give this a ***** out of ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
