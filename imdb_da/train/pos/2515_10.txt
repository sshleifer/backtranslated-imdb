Moon Child, starring Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie when I expected. In fact, I was very impressed, and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Seen in Mallepa, history follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Sho's brother Shinji and Toshi, who rob and murder. At one of the robberies, Sho meets Hyde's Kei vampire, burning in the sunlight. Through the coarse events, Kei's true nature is shown, but no one pushes him away. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal, immutable Kei has raised Sho and the two have an extremely close bond. Sho and Kei then meet Son in a monstrous gun battle and they become quick friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with his son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time goes by again and shows an adult Sho, this time empty of Kei. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedy after tragedy, this film pops into the reality of life and all it's hardships that focus on friendship and love. It's a really moving movie that's sad yet beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for the play, I think Gackt did a great job. Hyde did a fantastic job for a first hour. <br /> <br /> The shoots were beautiful, but the movie had the rare and short gruesome shots. All in all, I must say this movie is great, moving, and I highly recommend it.
