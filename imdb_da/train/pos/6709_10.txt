What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it is a ghost to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The literature on magic is so diverse and portrays the ideas of classical, medieval and modern magic such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique, because it allows us to experience a lot of modern wizardry, worth seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities and it is a pleasure to see Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and "other" kingdom. I would recommend this to any family because the TV series is clean, fun and adventurous. Classic!
