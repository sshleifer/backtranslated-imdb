At some point in our culture, where reality is exposed as narrative, the overwhelming fiction, as we know it on the small and large screen, "Apart From That" is a film that reveals real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in the presentation than I have ever seen before. The usual shuffle conventions do not exist in this movie, leaving a content audience to sit and watch those real moments trickle one after the other on the screen. While watching the movie, and even after post-contemplation, it's hard to believe that these amazing performances really were that show. Every moment with the great actors felt that truth was postponed in their daily routine. Still, "Apart from that" does not want a documentary or reality TV, but instead goes to a separate category with its unique filmography and direction. I look forward to seeing this new category story continue with other movies by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen.
