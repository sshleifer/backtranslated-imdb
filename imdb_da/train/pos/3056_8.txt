Had placed this on my TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, some really hardworking in the industry and when I finally looked at that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has some Altman-like flavor (he mentioned at the end credits as a "thank you" person) utilizing seemingly independent independent plot lines that blend as film draws to its climax. Macy is clean, clean and honest as a man who cannot seem to escape his "destiny", Sutherland plays and portrays so few can, Neve adds splash to a deliberately dimmed environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission Impossible on TV?) Not to mention the regular John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is unclear, the dialogue is free of clich√© and thought-provoking (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspending faith and enjoy, this is really time well spent.
