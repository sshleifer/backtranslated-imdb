The good soil is a good movie !!! Everyone should see ... It is tearing and very warm warming. It is aimed at improving the values-formation on endurance, humility and family love ... History can be related to our lives today, especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way in which we respond to such a problem is very crucial, and if a person is not strong enough to meet this, he can be left defenseless and useless. I am very happy how the characters justified their roles even the young actors ... Their emotions have imprisoned the audience. The movie may have been made in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you will not end. It does really well! There should be a re-entry for this very nice movie.
