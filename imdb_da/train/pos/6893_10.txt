Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, fun, tender, brave and loving. He gives a superior dimension to a movie that is even a masterpiece, as much of the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as in history or the rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: For me, the best French movie is all the time.
