The family is about two families who are after each other's blood. Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is an underground donor operating from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once by mistake he kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother is out to avenge his brother's death. He kidnapped Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The movie has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where the term means more instead of his dialogues. Akshay's small role has also put him on an equal footing with Amitabh. I didn't understand what Bhumika Chawala did in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few points in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most sought-after criminal in the city, but he is still free in town. Kidnapping of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a large donor have no security cover?
