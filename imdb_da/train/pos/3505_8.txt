I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that as often happens on Amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie, which repeat the same, somewhat unclear points of speech, almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie: That's fine. It's a fun, sweet and very straightforward movie. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens, and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing unauthorized or exploitative about these children. Is grandma a bizarre character? Yup. Does the dialogue explain and plot this? Yes, fortunately, they do. Are there other movies in LES and with Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does it make this movie a crime ?? as some of the (in my eyes, astroturf) comments will suggest? Almost. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff in the comparison, but we have never had it, and I am touched to the core of this film's humility with purpose and tender spirit. <br /> <br /> That said, I'd like to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! :-D
