Ah, I loved this movie. I think it had it all. It made me laugh aloud over a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing it from a girl's perspective. I think it's a shame that it scored only 5.2 in rating. Too many men vote? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I don't enjoy all the smart flicks, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be low and not as fun as they thought they were. But as I said, this movie had everything, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, fine actors. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character is very similar to Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives, but what? It was great. I will keep this movie for rainy days, days when I feel low and need a few laughs.
