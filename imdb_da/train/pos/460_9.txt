This is a wonderful new crime series that brings together three old stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help cope with old cases led by younger career-focused Amanda Redman. The three quirky, irritable old police make a brilliant team and use twenty-year-old detection methods in a police force that has since been far away - sometimes effective other times for their senior officer's horror. The three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and everything. There are amazing cartoons, and some very moving as each of the three have to come up with growing old and legacy from their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we are promised another series next year) each of the characters has evolved. Uncle James Bolam cannot express his wife's relentless death. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight his demons of the past - and continue to take the medicine! While Amanda Redman faces the all too familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The history lines have been interesting if they are quite heavily dependent on the wonders of the DNA test. But it is the interplay between four of Britain's finest actors who have made the series inevitable.
