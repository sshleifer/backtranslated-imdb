David Duchovny plays the lead in this movie. Now many people find out the fact would not even bother to see it. Very unfair to say the least. David made his name on the x files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug-abused doctor turned off for malpractice. By accident, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. But the FBI is interested in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in Clare's supportive role - gangsters minor.She puts a solid performance. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom is amazing and deeply immersed in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think and eventually I would rate his performance his credible. His well-known monotonous tone and straight face are present, but it does not detract from the film
