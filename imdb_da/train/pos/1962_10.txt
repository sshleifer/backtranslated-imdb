What a thrill trip! Twisted and thoughtful. Once again, Sharon Stone pulls out of her her beautiful, beautiful, enchanting character Catherine Tramell impeccably. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has now moved. Both busy cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for anyone like Catherine Trammel to stay. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, a refreshing departure from his role as the Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Dazzling cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, excitement - all the "basic instincts". Mind bend all the way through. Great manuscript. From the climactic stage to the surprise ending, this movie is anything but boring! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
