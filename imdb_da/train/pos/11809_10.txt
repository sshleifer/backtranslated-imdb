Dick Tracy was not the best for many cartoon fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocence just to be a comic book with villains who have severe-looking suffering and are fun. Warren Beatty controls and stars as the protagonist fighting crime without even using superpowers. I have seen Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the primary colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to see with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with zest. Madonna as the treasure that is the second villain in this movie does not play the same boy toy she represents. As I said, no blood, obscenities, sexually induendo, or anything to offend anyone.
