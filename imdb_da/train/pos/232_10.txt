What a nice movie. The characters were not only lively but alive, reflecting real-life life and strife within a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily relate to a person they know in their own family or a circle of close friends. The story has a true life that the viewer can assimilate into and be a part of the drama, laughter and tears as the film's history evolves. Scripture does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions, and reactions of the signs of conflict, meaning, and resolution. <br /> <br /> Not an epic, but it's a very nice movie to watch with loved ones. Lots of knowing main keys and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
