This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It is - sad because AIDS in the early 90s was sad. But its real message is one of love and endurance. Mark and Tom were in a long-term loving relationship. Their devotion to one another is evident right away, and as the AIDS ravage escalates and becomes their focus of life, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartfelt. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and healthcare, volunteering as an HIV / AIDS clinic counselor. The movie spoke to me like no other AIDS movie from his day, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the great experiences I experienced on a daily basis in real life. From first-hand experience, I knew how it was to see AIDS eating away in former living, young and healthy people; Since that was the case with Mark and Tom in the movie, it was very much like seeing my friends really get worse. It touched me in a way that even all these years later affect me.
