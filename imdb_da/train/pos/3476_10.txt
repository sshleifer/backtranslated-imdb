Let's cut in the hunt: If you're a baby boomer, you've inevitably spent some time knowing that in 1976, McCartney had the gum to fall into John's city hermit life and spend the day with him. You also wondered how things went. I heard exactly the same reports that the author of this movie heard from John's and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in much the same way that this movie does. But none of my beliefs could have bought tears for my eyes, as this incredible work and play does. I found it incredibly lifelike, completely plausible and 100% saccharin free. Now can anyone explain why I didn't hear about this masterpiece before it was shown by CBC last night? I think it's already three years old, for the sake of goodness! And yes, if you are a Beatles fan, this is a must-see performance! Even the subtle paraphrasing of the Beatles' tunes in the background is inspired.
