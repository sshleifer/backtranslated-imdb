A hilarious and insightful perspective on the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first-time author / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local dining room to persuade their dating woes. We meet with Brad: a beautiful, wall-street playboy with a fast and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive author; Jonathan: a sexually confused nice guy with an affinity for hand cream and masturbation; and Eric: the married guy who cherishes his weekly meetings with his single friends in the hope of some enlightenment about his dull and banal poisonous existence. The trials and tribulations of men's single life in New York are entertainingly expressed, reflecting the Sex of the City and HBO's new comedy The Mind of Married Man, and bringing a faint light to scam. The story takes a twist when the three singles meet Mia - wittily played by Amanda Peet - and everything falls to her. She seduces them each with her eerie ability to adhere to the personalities that they exhibit. When they come to realize that they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship. The whip is a realistic depiction of the dating world, one that the critic has failed to recognize. In plain language they missed the point. The main character here is caricatures of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, blending satire and humility and must not be taken as seriously as the disparagement of criticism suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from start to finish.
