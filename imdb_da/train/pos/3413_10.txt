Just came out and can't believe what a brilliant documentary this is. You rarely go out of a movie theater in such awe and astonishment. Recently, films have become so overhyped that the excitement of discovering something very special and uniquely rare. Amores Perros did it to me when it first came out, and this movie makes me now. I didn't know anything about this until I went into it and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you can get the feeling that this is one of the touchy movies about a great triumph covered by the top music and trying to get us fully convinced of the great story it tells. But then don't let us in. Fortunetly, it's not that movie. People tell the story! This does a good job of capturing every moment of their engagement as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is so much beyond climbing that does everything they go through, so much more excited. Touching Void was also a great doctor on mountaineering and showing the intensity in an exciting way, but this film is much more a human story. I've just seen it today, but I want to go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
