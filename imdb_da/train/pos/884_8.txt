If you are a fan of film noir and think they don't do them as they used to, here's your answer - they just don't make them in Hollywood anymore. We must return to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and amazing a suitable movie from that genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderful scary little gift for the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, with sharp storytelling and fine performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been written in the 40s: stupid but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discovering each other while living the life of gloomy desperation and longing, manipulating each other to fulfill their own ends, developing complex love / hate relationships, cooking up criminal scheme involving heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. All actions take place in depressing, seedy and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Of course, Audiard has made some modern twists. Femme fatale is an under-employed office worker who is almost deaf and uses her lipstick to avenge those who marginalize her. And where you might expect steaming love scenes you discover, both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Add some modern technology and music, and it seems like a modern movie, but make no mistake - this is old school film noir. It's as good as any movie from the genre and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.
