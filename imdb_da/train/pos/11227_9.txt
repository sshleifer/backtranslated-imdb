Hidden Borders - is more than fanfiction - it is well thought out and organized series that keep the Star Trek world alive and growing. From a fun little fan project to now a well-known net series; Hidden borders have a bit of something for every star trek fan in it. Viewed in Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Timelines Hidden Frontier addresses issues and issues in other Star Trek series of storytelling using well-developed characters, plot and story arches. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on social context stories that Gene Roddenberry has not got on the screen and has shown the evolution of characters in long-term space missions - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as exciting space war and conflict Sci -Fi dependent know and love. Performed in a "Green Screen" study; Hidden borders bring a rollicking cast of firm on the screen and into your hearts. The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. Inventive use of green screen technology, props, make-up and costumes works to make The Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and credible. Hidden Frontier has gone how few threads to go into the world of science fiction, and thrived when they came there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature on a well thought out site with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and actors and a fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to down load and see.
