Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low budget, almost unknown movie, but is one of my favorite movies all the time. I discovered it crashing into the video store and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (which is also amazing in the movie) appear together. Go with this one and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
