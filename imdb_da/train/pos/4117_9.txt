"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colored film of master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly it is not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It's in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the residents are homeless drunkards, beggars, trampling, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and environment to color, but they are actually very sad stories, some of which are heartbreaking. I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father who dreams of having his own house and built by them; The story of the delayed boy who thinks he is driving a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her founder. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Death Damage ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Death Damage ?? The Way of Life")
