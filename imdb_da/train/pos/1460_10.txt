Excellent movie that reveals how people are associated with the taken for granted, ordinary gems exchanged under Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the workers in China, the factory owner, the New Orleans pearl dealer and even the New Orleans revelers. What stands out is the director's ability to tell a difficult story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is exciting, and I only wish I knew how he came in. It is a beautiful story with no sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion gives hope without letting people feel alienated.
