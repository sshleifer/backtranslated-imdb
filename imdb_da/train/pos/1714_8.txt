Watching movies I was in very bright mood and also this movie is light, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, leaving a long-lasting memory in one's mind. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Abhay and his profession as witnesses during filing. Soha comes to marriage, and his girlfriend doesn't do it and leaves Soha alone on the street, she can't come home and she has nothing to live on in this situation. Abahy turns out to be a helper to her, it's the background of history. <br /> <br /> The rest is only visible, and the end of history is bitterly sweet, as Abhay faces, keeping you at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs is OK the direction is good and so as the script you feel the movie is slow but looking at the demand for the story, it's okay. A really reliable special with bright mood I enjoyed this at home with cola and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10
