This is a good movie and no more. And it's fun to see. Sure it is obscuring political problems. But then what? I'm sure she didn't try to make 'good night and good luck' here. Let's not try to do anything else but what it is ... easy fare. <br /> <br /> And much fun in it! <br /> <br /> Do we remember what 1984 was like? We have become very sophisticated according to the media what we see or not. I tend to separate at this point. Goldie knew this was fun and she went ahead and did it. Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, House, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Looks like old times, Foul Play, Death becomes her, First Wives Club and remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie knows herself very well and she knows what she can do really well. <br /> <br /> She has always made me laugh joyfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and everything she's ever been to. She never tried to be anything else but who she is ... and that's the bubbly, giggly, girl next door who's very pretty and have a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you just have to light up because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable suffering. If it even comes that late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovable, cartoon actress.
