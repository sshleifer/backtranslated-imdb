From the top shelf of great classic books, this masterful story comes from Pearl Buck. The book as the film is called "The Good Earth". It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to 'Great House' where he has taken a slave woman called O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to her kindness by storing a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. Over the following years, O-Lan shows her worth by continually sharing her husband's urge, problems, and change of fortunes. Over the past few years, they raise a family and see their simple household weather both celebration and famine. In fact, at the lowest point of their lives, each one discovers the value of the company, loyalty and love. With the changing times, their growing family is both helped and threatened by friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but tolerated compassion. Wang has his "old father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise and remind him of the fragile and creepy nature of life. Two notable actors producing impressive appearances in this movie are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's Elder Son and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Recommended for all audiences. ****
