. . . or write on a keyboard on the computer, they would probably give this eponymous movie a rating of "10." After all, there are no elephants being killed during the film; It is not even suggested that there is evil. On the contrary, the master of the ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch) complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without the permission of the government (and his tone suggests that such permissions are not within the probability range). In addition, the elements - in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic - put the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to the complete destruction of the Elephant People (which the natives judge them) to close the story. If you are able to see the current release EARTH, you will find that Elephant People is far less good today.
