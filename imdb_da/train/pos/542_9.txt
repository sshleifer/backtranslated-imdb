When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I would see. It took me weeks to realize that I have seen the original and loved it. So I had even more reason to see. Well, I saw. It was actually better than most TV movie sequels. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I didn't like most of the characters, Brian's included. But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and horrific characters, so Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shone once more. At the end, I fought at Stanley and his own happy end. If you liked the original cabin by the lake, or if you like horror movies without the blood, I suggest you see this.
