Let me start by saying that "War, Inc" is not everyone's cup of tea. However, it is very pleasant (and makes you think - "Oh, shit"). Comedy involved the movie is not at all obvious - it's pretty subtle (Tamerlane thought, dry cleaning, etc.), and it changes with twists and turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> I can only be one, but I don't want to compare this with "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I didn't want to say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was unbelievable in her delivery of lines and comedic timing - though she was hardly in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a compelling reporter and manages to pull it off. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (though her accent is a little unreal). On the whole, the film is what I would call "entertaining". It doesn't have a particular story, and it's quite stupid at times, but it has a subtle message. I'd say it's worth looking at.
