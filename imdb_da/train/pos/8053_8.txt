This is one of Sammo's great early comedy film. This is not a parody to get into the dragon, the protagonist (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well to a man of his size. Nominal story of how his struggles continue to cause his dear problems - so struggles. Oh, the fighting. Good, fast-paced, high-impact scenes (the white guy playing a boxer seems to be really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). The funniest bit of this movie was purely accidental. There is a Jim Kelly-looking guy (one of three experts employed to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in the blackface with an afro wig. Come on, didn't they have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? I think I've seen enough white fake-as-hell "Chinese" in old American movies as well. <br /> <br /> This is one for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
