A very close and sharp description of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy an 18 year old guy who makes his first experiences in his homosexual love for another boy during a vacation with part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie because of his extremely clear and surrogated storytelling with all those "Sound-close-ups" and quiet moments that had been full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
