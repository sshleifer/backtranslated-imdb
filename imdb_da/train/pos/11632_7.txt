Greetings again from the dark. What a relief ... a thriller that is actually exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this cozy little classic thrill thriller from famous actress movie director Wes Craven ("Scream" movie and "A Nightmare on Elm Street") . Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this a work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes when we see that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people either in person or phone. She is a natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what seems to be coincidence, the movie really takes flight. Seeing the two yuppie types flirting while the audience knows that something is brewing is confusing film production! The plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing, and the 30 plus minutes on board are uncomfortably claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing about others' involvement and if anyone wants to come to her. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only downfall occurs during climax when the lamb becomes a superhero. An interesting plot unit makes us think that little Rachel has the necessary uplift to see this through, but we can't help but ring a little. The most exaggerated scenes involve irate hotel guests, an annoying airline pass, Cillian's damage and FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological play between the leaders. Unfortunately, the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized, but in general it is an above average thriller thriller that is worth seeing for everyone but the final.
