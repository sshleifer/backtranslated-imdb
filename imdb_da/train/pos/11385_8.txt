This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early 50's, and it's definitely better to see it out there. The film was directed by the respected Vincente Minnelli and the stars Gene Kelly in the main line. Both made very few films together these days, of which this is probably their best known. <br /> <br /> The movie itself actually won the best picture Oscar during the year, which made it hit movies like "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Named Desire", "The African Queen "," Quo Vadis "," The Blue Veil "," Death of a Merchant "the same year. A real realization of course, but also a little too big credit for this lovely, bright and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you'll probably be entertained by it all, which is also Thanks to the movie, the beautiful color looks and the many great characters in this movie. The musical tracks are all well-finished, which is no big surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really, not everything that was told in this movie could be done in half an hour less or so? I mean, we already know where the movie is going, but yet it manages to stretch it all out as long as possible. Not that it makes the movie pull in any part, it just makes it a little longer. The movie could certainly have been made with a few smaller musical numbers in it. <br /> <br /> One of the better MGM musicals, it's not without its mistakes itself. <br /> <br /> 8/10
