I don't see much porn, but I love pornstars. And I love gory movies. So when I heard about a porn star movie, I was really excited. It was of course many years ago, and when I heard about all the trouble making and completing the movie, I never thought I'd actually see it. But I did, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its faults. First, the mistakes. The story is set in Ireland called Samhain, but the story that it seemed to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland. So why not just put it there and skip the third class report on Samhain / Irish Immigrants / Halloween? It also breaks its own rules by saying that you are sure of the paths, but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we have to deal with. There is a large stone castle that is apparently old, but no one has noticed it before. The self-conscious horror movie references are annoying, and so are the signs. The heroine bone has a flashback mount of all of its dead friends, which includes a sign she never meets. The end makes no sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? Do! Sure I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such an uncomfortable movie that was not afraid to be more than a gorilla movie. Two murders are wildly over the top, and Taylor Hayes has a lovely disgusting scene. The two wild murders even get extended shots on the DVD. I have always been in the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil races reinforced it.
