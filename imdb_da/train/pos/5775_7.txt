C'mon people, see the title! LAUGH OUT LOUD! I remember watching this movie on Saturday's Late Night Creature features many years ago. It's a big, cheesy monster girl with hilarious acting and two wonderful moronic hillbillies that add to the chuck factor. The 2 redneck boat hire boys are the movie! LOL and you will love the boat scene where the English guy and his wife talk about all the stars, and it's dinner and sun. Bloody fun !!! You can tell they just don't care about the plot, they just wanted to blow through the movie of the movie as soon as possible. Bottom line, you will love it if you love the 70s schlock.
