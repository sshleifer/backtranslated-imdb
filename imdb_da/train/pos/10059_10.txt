This movie is the best movie ever. I can't remember the last time a movie has pulled tears out of me. With a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie should have: Excellent dialogues, music, action, history / plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street that performs the famous for The King of Masks and a little girl who sold like a boy in serf bazaar. Little girl seemed to be his grandson and King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in reality. Every scene they were together was invaluable. The camera's work is flawless and grabbed you. The action is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the King of Masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks beautiful and plays his character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and friendly character extremely well. If you don't have this movie, try it once, see it.
