A very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment demands, and we all enjoy his success with him. The most insteresting for me is a man without special powers to the problems and just beat them with human abilities (he was a great swimmer and had a big shout)
