This is the kind of movie for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can continue with its own business when you come down in a large armchair and soft for a few hours. Amazing performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently plot the plot. There is no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a hot and witty paddle through New York life at its best. A family movie in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.
