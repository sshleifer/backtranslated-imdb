This is a great movie. Some will disagree with me, but if you know something about the Bible, you know it. I think everyone should see it !! I agree with a new updated version that is kind, but the message is still on. If you can see this movie. Is not a "scare hell of your movie", it is truthful with the Bible. I think U. N. will play a major role in the forthcoming world government. The last days are disguised with the Bible. Look at what has happened to the chip for dogs and cats that have now come to light to protect children from being kidnapped. It is the size of a grain of rice. This, I feel, is the foremost runner of the mark of the animal being spoken in the Bible. Without the label you cannot sell or buy, with the small chip in the future there is no one to tell how much info can be put on.
