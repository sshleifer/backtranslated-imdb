This begins an effort between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe Bets, the man can't spend a whole night in a creepy castle. Well, of course he can, but will he come out unharmed? Hard to say with all those strange people who shouldn't be around, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a pretty strange movie, as the presentation is in both French and English, and changes back and forth a couple of times. Maybe it's done because parts of dialogue have been lost? It is also rather dark and claustrophobic, as you do not look much beyond a small circle of light that creates candles and so on, plus there is a sense of fear and imminent judgment pretty much all the time. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored, and I wondered what could be censored in a 1964 movie until I saw the topless scene, I think it might be. Overall, this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele also does the movie as well. 8 out of 10
