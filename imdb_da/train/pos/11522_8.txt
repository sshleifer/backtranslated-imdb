I wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great instructor. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a great follow-up to it even though it is starting to pull. The action and direction were fantastic. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow, except for the script. At times, the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for amazing cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
