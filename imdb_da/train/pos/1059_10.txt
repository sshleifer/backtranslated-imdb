I love this show, it's sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba does a good job, it's time we have a kick-ass girl who is not the cutesy type. The whole cast is wonderful, and all the episodes have good plot. Everything is well laid out and thought about. Putting it together must have taken a while because it was no hurry to just knock something together. It's a big show entirely.
