This is simply the epitome of what one made for television movies should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in high school that we stumbled upon this. The cheesy trades. The badly written script. The good ol 'boys. The ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, clich√© and banal premise. Riding in pickup trucks with your jacket body. It has it all. <br /> <br /> You will meet famous characters: Gold digging, stupid rich boy who wants to do it alone, friends-as-know-better, father who knows better but drives away son. And the wife. Propped up. In a pickup. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Several things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since we looked at this beauty. Everyone involved in the creation deserves a medal.
