As one of the previous commentators said, this had the foundation of a great movie, but something was happening to delivery. Such a waste because Collette's results were scary and Williams was credible. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it might just have been the movie. It came across as a Canadian movie, like the first seasons of the X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. It also needed a little more excitement. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The film reached that moment when it was gone; kind of like a false climax. I can see how being too exciting would have taken away from the "reality" of history, but I thought that part had come when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie must have a director's cut trying to solve these problems.
