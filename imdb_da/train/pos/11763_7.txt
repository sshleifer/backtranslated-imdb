I guess everyone should make a comeback at some point. And it's just as embarrassing that Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in "The Best of Times". Yep, the man who was crazy about the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to play a game that costs his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) won't just go along with it. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie for every man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you giggles (at least to say). Check it out.
