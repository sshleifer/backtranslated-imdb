I don't know who could find fault with a simple and human and fun movie like this with lots of goodies for your heart. I enjoyed every minute of it and guessed the end halfway through the movie - but it didn't disappoint me at all. It will not only touch your heart, but it is such a good family-friendly movie - we need many more like these!
