I've read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking story. There are some who believe that the added narrative is weak and <br /> <br /> I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. Ca. Two brothers find each other back after the disaster and the cliff over Tony. But I do not think that narrative is unnecessary. Just as I do many theorists, I believe that our own lives are stories. We live and make our own autobiography. So if we tell about our lives, it is always in the form of narration. We do not sum up facts like: Birth, childhood, high school etc. We make a story about our lives. Because we are familiar with stories, we will also put history in a story. Because we can identify ourselves in the form of a story. We can better understand the things that happened in the story when it was told in the form of a story. So it is the purpose to add a story to documentaries. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If it were me out there, I'd be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the other point that makes a blocking movie about it. True, it has recently been a great movie about 9/11. Although there have been a few on the subject, but none of them like this documentary. But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years? I agree that trying to make a lot of money out of 9/11 is wrong. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell history. How many films about World War II have we seen? If I hadn't seen these movies, my view of WW would be completely different. I remember seeing Schindler's List and I was crying for an hour during the class. Film gives you a good picture of the things that happened in history, and even though it is fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and accidents. <br /> <br /> So my point: Telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story and never makes us forget what happened.
