Until I saw this especially on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I have now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft, so Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing for the whole show. If you like to laugh at you, see this particular!
