As a lover of bad movies, I certainly beat the paydirt with this one. The reason is not really that bad, but there are a few cases where you really have to ask yourself: "What's going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore had become so fat and slow as this film was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the battle scenes to double time. There are also scenes where there is a slow-motion instant reproduction, jumping on a ten-foot-high wall (by playing falls of the backwards), naked men going out of capital letters and sex that literally bring down the roof (with cable is on fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a completely free and random comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun of all the customers, intrigued by people making some strange dance. There are so many things bad about this movie, but they are bad in an entertaining way, and if you take your eyes off the movie, you may miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for actual value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for selecting errors and goofs, average up to 7/10.
