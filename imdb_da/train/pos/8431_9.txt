] Have you not seen this movie? Have you not even heard of this movie? It wouldn't surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years had no studio belief in the picture and it was never downloaded for larger distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited round with virtually no promotion, and most of the major film critics did not even have trouble reviewing it. I guess a movie based on a single action, a set of games about apartheid, and its influence on two people has never had a chance on today's market - and that's the loss of the intelligent filmmaker. <br /> <br /> For that record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved nominations (like the filmmaker), but the film received so little fanfare that I can't even blame the academy on one. This is a movie that is challenging, thought-provoking and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on their own terms. Taking this into account, it is certainly not a movie for thoughtless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to dress Athol Fugard's games. Well, we get a few broken flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the movie version of BOESMAN AND LENA is a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to attack but each other. A third character connects them for a while (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never falls from the title signs and what they have become. Bassett and Glover provide brave performances like the broken pair, performances that simply couldn't be improved. Powerfully and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserve to be rediscovered at home video. Hands down, the best movie in the year 2000.
