Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes really) duel not only for Debra Wing's minds, but really over a secret from their childhood that gave them odds over their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal features (the fire department acts as a song Greek choir), but there is also humor, humor and romance. The soundtrack is also good. And, like the way American Werewolf in London used every big wolf song, they could get 'but with fire, and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) and put his own trailer in rockin' a lady ~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing from the quote btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you'll never go back!' <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3, don't put yourself off ~ give it a chance :)
