I really enjoyed this episode, which was a big surprise because of the bad reputation it seems to have acquired. From a purely written perspective, 'The 16mm Shrine' is an absolute treat, with great dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling. In particular, I have really enjoyed the philosophical decline of the episode, thanks to the existence and the realities of being, while balancing it with more psychological issues such as denial, pride and desire. 'The sixteen millimeter sanctuary' is an episode about how these ideas, based on an unwillingness to accept change, seem to be able to alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a great example of the cerebral twilight zone; one who explores the mind rather than the outside world. These elements all come very nicely to create a thoughtful and incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The section is not without its faults, but mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was convincing everywhere, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable. This is of course an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written his character. In addition, Leisen did not know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes getting them to do almost nothing - which probably explains why the Lupino bad ideas accepted half of the time. Fortunately, Balsam does a great job of covering many weak spots and helping to redeem the show from a working perspective at least. As I have said before, if you are a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, it should not be as bad as it is sometimes done. Besides the writing I mentioned above, the episode also has some amazing photography (it still surprises me that the show looks good almost fifty years later!) And decent enough set design. All in all, 'The sixteen-millimeter shrine' is a fantastic episode and, above all, one is sure to make you think.
