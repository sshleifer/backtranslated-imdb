The Write Word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and radiant 'does' is to destroy the myth associated with glam and glittering, which color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (read party habits) we follow with such a madman, which only our actual voyeuristic stripe can explain. <br /> <br /> The Page 3 phenomenon is as regrettable as it is enigmatic. How exactly did it get such control over the printed word, and when did it begin to enter the front page, there is another debate. Bhandarkar avoids it wisely. He is only concerned about the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in that context, he relates the various elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (although I don't compare Bhandarkar with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses countless characters to promote his motive. Whether it's a page 3 wannabe NRI, gate crashers, the recent kingdom, a forthcoming model, a socialite politician, or an erotic novella authority; All the characters are introduced with a lens and each has a separate character sketch, although their parts may be minimal. And there is the film's appeal. <br /> <br /> Concern Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist covering page 3 for Nation Today. Initially satisfied with her job, she soon begins to see this underly uglyness covered by her fake and cosmetic profigacy. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this topic a moral political film and avoids concentrating on a character alone. Therefore, the film is not just about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a tool for a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialite that detracts from social pollution , Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a gay makeup artist and Madhavi's roommate Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the sassy airhostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - a hopeful actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) into a story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi to make a tight manuscript. The dialogues from Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar are written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, may fall flat with the lack of true performances. Fortunately, 'Page 3' brims with actors and not stars. The Konona goes through his author-supported role with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part but almost overwhelms it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted, however, with a signed character. At times, the director seems keen to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the connections in which they are used do not make them so hurried. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt to saturate our voyeurism, but he takes it one step further. He takes us into the photographs and exposes us to the cruel reality of this human sect, which hardly seems to be living in another and distant world. It's the same people who pampered in New Year's blessing, while a few hundred miles away their compatriots had been devastated by the hardness of nature! Clear writing, skillfully incorporated songs, possible performances and a true sense of sincerity are what make this movie worthy of the lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimal way to enter a new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek tire <br /> <br /> Rating **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent <br /> January 29, 2005
