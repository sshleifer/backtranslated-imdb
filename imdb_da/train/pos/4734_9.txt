I'm a massive fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action movie star alive ... and thus - This movie rocked! I saw it in the video store, and as it was in the regular section of this mainstream video store, I first registered its presence and had to look twice. I knew immediately what I wanted to rent. My only qualm (I suppose I was expecting it) is that it was called (AAARGh) and not subtitle. Elsewise, the movie's original / strange / cool plot and full of action made it one of Jet Lis's better movies ... even though they all fall into that category ....
