Rock n roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps stupidity, the filmmaker is able to aggregate seven unfortunate years after following about two motionless rock groups. With that said, abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to capture the audience. If you've ever been interested in any area of ​​the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a staggering show. The music in the movie, although it suffers minimal from the necessary cutting and insertion, is worth the price of recording alone. the morning after I saw DiG! I went straight to the record company to download a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I had already started Dandy Warhol's sounds). Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other deep levels. Dig! is a sincere and sufficiently objective overview of the destructive and fleeting nature of the creative process and the people who seek to reject these forces.
