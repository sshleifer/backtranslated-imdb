Very good point: "Only an elite few (the top classes) would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusive English-speaking site like IMDb" Some may think the Internet is not real, but this view really puts the media community and democracy at risk : You're probably right .. Even if there is an internet cafe in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters can't afford to rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Get involved in the capitalist liberal intellectual surpreters of fascist classical right wing. It's probably your first time to use the Internet;) ..
