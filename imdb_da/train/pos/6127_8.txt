Jack Frost is about a serial killer sentenced to death. On his way to his death sentence, the prison cart, as he drives in, puts with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that makes his molecules with the snow on the ground, making him a snowman. Being a killer who would make him a killing snowman. Jack will now avenge himself on the sheriff who caught him. Jack now starts his rampage again and again kills people in a small town. I don't think Jack Frost has a chance to become a horror classic, but it's an entertaining flick. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but don't take it too seriously.
