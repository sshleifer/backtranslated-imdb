It has been 16 years since the original race, I had hoped that some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic now or at least sought to revive the original 65 episodes. I can't understand why the sci-fi or the cartoon network hasn't caught up. The Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scripts. The animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation today. It pretended the heavy tone-toy tie on the market, this may have sealed it's also punishment. I'd like to spend money on a DVD of GR, if available.
