One of the best true crime movies ever made and very true to Truman Capotey's book, which invented the recognized true crime recognition. Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and amazing plays by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake like Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson didn't continue to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white filmography and editing in this movie is top notch. The murder's restoration is frightening, and as it leaves the actual murders for your imagination, even more frightening than if they had shown that the shotgun went out. The film was filmed in the Clutter House itself, which had been sold to another person after the murders. The film has a very documentary feel --- besides the scenes at the Clutter home itself, other scenes were filmed at the petrol stations and the shops where the guys actually went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a good trip as a prosecutor in the short trial version, which is not only recorded in the courtroom itself, but has several of the real Clutter Murder jurors who exhibit themselves as the jury for the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it.
