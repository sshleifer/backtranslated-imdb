If you are a Crispin Glover fan, see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you should see this. If you are a film fan in general, see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably still be of great value, but the more work you have previously seen by Crispin or Sean, the better . <Br /> <br /> This movie is so fun, but it's also pure genius. There is nothing I know about it, like this movie. It's his own genre. I doubt anything like it will ever be done again. I can't say anything more about exactly why without partially destroying it, and some of the other reviews have already done a good job of doing so. <br /> <br /> In response to some of the reviewers here who gave it a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, there is no point where this movie could be called "boring". This may be the funniest, most entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated prospects. A timeless classic, which unfortunately very few will be able to claim to have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, who is also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, as Crispin Glover also stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this are movies rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after a diligent search, and there are a few ways to find what I know about. But I really want someone to put this on a DVD.
