I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost indefinite little role. And yet I have to admit that this movie wasn't really that bad, even though I feared the worst. When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save one of his friend's boyfriend and she tumbles to his death from a 4,000-foot-high mountain peak, he may not be able to force himself to continue working as a mountain rocker. For almost a year he does not put food in the reserve, but he returns. Soon after he gets back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers caught in a blizzard. At least that's what rangers think. In fact, it is a group of robbers who crashed with their aircraft in the mountains, after their bold plan to steal cases that came with money from a flying government plan failed. The cases are scattered throughout the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them ... <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it is a fun one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master heart and the leader of the bandit. I know him best from the television series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this movie. All in all, the action is ok, it had a lot to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This film was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snow-covered mountains and valleys, the mountains and the forests ... Maybe I give this movie a higher score than what I usually give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.
