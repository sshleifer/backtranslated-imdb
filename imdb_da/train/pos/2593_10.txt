It comes out of the left field and really is not what you expect. But I love it. The most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me. If you haven't been tipped off by the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you are in the goodies. <br /> <br /> Casting is great but doesn't stretch so much that it is palpable. Special effects come out of nowhere (seriously it is like a strange dark romantic comedy until they do - so WOW) and they are good. The overall cinematography is easy on the eyes, editing and sound are very good quality, and the twisted story unfolds without clich√©s. Although none of these aspects individually make it a crack, "what the hell?" factor ALONE makes it a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> The people who bash this movie make no sense. It's one of the often overlooked flicks of the 90s that you've never heard of or loved so much you jump by mentioning the title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the last group.
