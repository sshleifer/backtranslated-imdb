I used to see this show as a kid and I loved it! I saw it when it came on Toonami years ago .... Sheesh, I sound so old! I must have been 13 or 14 when it happened ... But still it had a great plot line and I am one of those girls who saw (and ADORED) Sailormoon and I enjoyed it very much. The animation was not the best .... Entirely entertaining in some parts, actually, and the voice action was extremely paralyzed at first, but it was all a good watch and I found myself sucking in it day after day. br /> <br /> The Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and full time one of my faves. Go Ryo !!!!
