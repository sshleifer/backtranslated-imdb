An American woman, her European husband and children return to her mother's home in "Watch on the Rhine", a 1943 movie based on Lillian Hellman's drama and starring Paul Lukas (who I think repeats her scene role here), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, often injured and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Luke) needs a long vacation on his wealthy son-in-law. But he finds out that there is really no escape, as one of the houseguests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell him. <br /> <br /> Great performances are highlighted in this film, much written to make Lillian Hellman's liberal point of view. It was certainly a strong propaganda vehicle at the time it was released when the wickedness of war and what happened to people in other countries reached safe US homes. The movie's big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching, just to mention a scene. Although this is not what you think of as a Bette Davis movie, she gives a wonderful performance here as Kur's loyal and loving wife, Sara. Her actors in the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of feeling. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes" she has written some really sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given the A cast and production values ​​of Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
