"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era, which has dialogues written by Jacques Prévert, but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in the couple Jouvet / Arletty than in the couple lovers, Annabella / Aumont.This latter is quite gentle, and their story is reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except that the chanteuse's story is a tragic . What is fascinating today is this popular little world channel Saint-Martin's settings. <br /> <br /> This movie is dear to the French movie buffs for another very special reason. Pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants an air change (atmosphère) Because she does not understand the importance of the world champion, Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) hears it is an insult and she delivers this line, it is undoubtedly the most famous of whole French cinema: In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Are you able to meet the atmosphere?" Translation attempt: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Have I got a face to the atmosphere? This is our French" No one is perfect ".
