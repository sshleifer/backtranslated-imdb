Australia's first mainstream slasher movie hits the screen with a bang. And a staff. And a slice. And a scream or two. And lots of blood, fears, red herring and lots of laughs. In fact, there are plenty of first surrounding rocks - it's Dave Warner's first script to be produced, although he has several others either optional or under negotiation it's the first major movie by director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; And it's also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a bunch of guys deep in the toes of this genre for the first time, they probably know their stuff. Cut tells the story of a bunch of Australian film students hearing about a slasher movie, Hot Blood, it was never finished because the director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who played the psycho killer in the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite their lecturer (who was assistant director at night, Hilary died) warning them that when someone tries to start production of Hot Blooded again, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) dies and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decides to go ahead and complete the film. They put together a crew and manage to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - actually to the original location - to complete Hot Blooded ?? 14 years after shooting down. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a slasher movie, lots of blood flow follows? long with lots of laughs, a few good scares and a rocking Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good mass market war movie as well as Hollywood. It's a finely crafted feature with excellent special effects, a tight plot and a killer - Scarman - it's a welcome addition to the series of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
