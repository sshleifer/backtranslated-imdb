Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest films. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy to be set up only as the autumn man, which he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy as I am". The reason is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the scouts' carnival hall is one of the most amazing movie footage. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. This is the only time Rita Hayworth has ever played a complex but credible character. None, but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and color the brassy blonde. No one should miss this picture.
