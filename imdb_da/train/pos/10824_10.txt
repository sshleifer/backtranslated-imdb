"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the biggest rock comedy of all time. It is wrongly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap" as it has no relation to. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and quite frankly, not a very good one, despite it being the "excursion" of many rock cliches). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, good songs and great human situations. You tend to worry about people in "Still Crazy". That's all that matters. Oh yes, the music is also nice, written by Mick Jones from Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but will later become acquainted with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Movies).
