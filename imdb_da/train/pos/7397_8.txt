"Xizao" is the story of the collapse of modern life and the ancient traditions and its effects on a family in China. When Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman returning home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe his father Liu (Xu Zhu) is dead. He notes that his father still lives, as well as his old neighborhood and his father's old business, the public bathroom. The film centers around Da Ming's family, and how he should learn the meaning of his father's job, something he had always considered an old tradition to die soon. The film also explores his relationship with Is Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the small society's problems and how the bathroom is a place that cleans not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the movie, the family and the progress problems are incredibly well managed and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very well developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> Conductor Yang Zhang tells his story in a simple way so the characters sign the job. It's a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly with the movie, and I doubt much that another style would fit the movie as well. Zhang has huge potential as he can tell a story without the help of visual flare or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The action is excellent in its naturalistic approach, all acting in a very natural way, and it looks almost like they were real people who were filmed. The three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming is probably stealing the performance. <br /> <br /> Even when the movie could have stood for a degrading "old days was much better" message, instead it takes a state of balance as saying that progress is good and we must continue, but we must Don't forget where we came from and keep a balance between modern life and the old traditions. <br /> <br /> An amazing and moving movie. 8.10
