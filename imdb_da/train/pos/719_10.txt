Although this movie is cheesiness at best, it is completely pulled out. This film must undoubtedly be considered a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I like - movies with depth (chick flicks if you need to - I blame my wife for this) and thoughtless comedies where I can sit back and relax. This film is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine showed me to this movie shortly after the release. When I looked a little shallow, he said to me, "You should watch this movie. It's just your type of movie." Foregoing the insult, I began to see. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's The Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, but now slightly dated, is a must see for Ramone's fans - or anyone else for that matter.
