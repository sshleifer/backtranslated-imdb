I am actually upset by the comment I read, saying that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was destroyed by the black and white recording. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's amazing, it's time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people have to go through is quite remarkable. It took them a week just to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs, which climbed into a solid rocking pole, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I want to see someone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing shots and an incredible story.
