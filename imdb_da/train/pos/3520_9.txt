This is a "B Series" Film Noir, and my voice reflects its membership in that genre. I watched this movie last night at a left bank cinema in Paris, where it opened a two-week movie noir round. The film has some flaws, yes, but too many delicious items have to be ignored. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer noted, the drum scene is incredible! (B-movies could enter where A-movies were forbidden to enter!) And the plot is exciting. As for Franchot Tone, however, I disagree: for me, he is appropriately mysterious; just the right shade of cruel. It must be remembered that there is a kind of German expressionism taking place here (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war) and then an air of exaggeration fit into this whole movie. At least it does me. <br /> <br /> But it's the beautiful Ella Raines, who only in this third credited performance kept this viewer started throughout the movie. A "Girl Friday" type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it is a wonder she didn't become a household name. But she is so good here that I just ordered another movie from her ('Impact') from the internet and I can't wait to see it too.
