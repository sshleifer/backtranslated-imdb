Meatball Machine is a fantastic splatter movie, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that mutate people into freaky robot war machines. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie is not for everyone, people who love splatter movies or the movie Tetsuo: Iron Man will applaud it. <br /> <br /> The special effects can be cheesy at some points in the movie, but it's not exactly that you take the movie very seriously. All in all, it is very fun, but if you find budding romantics who are attacked by slimy tumors such as goblins who are trying to destroy each other in bloody alien troops.
