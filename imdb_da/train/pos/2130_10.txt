A wonderful movie filled with great undervalued performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is the undercurrent of sadness throughout. The story is stressed by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing jobs in a world where it had catastrophic consequences. Most of all, it was put into a world that no longer existed after being torn apart at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the movie is almost no comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with the comics. It's even more fun - listen to Margaret Sullivan's tough dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and see his painful expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable mix of poetry and meanness. It's fun, pointed and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten largest screen comedies ever made.
