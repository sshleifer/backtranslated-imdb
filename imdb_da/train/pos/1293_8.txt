This is an excellent little movie about the loneliness of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in taxi driver, Clouseau inspector (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he does not make any effort at all! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and fatalism that can withstand any hope of always getting interconnection - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same situation, but at least he does a brave effort to exceed his extended virginhood (he is 28 and admits he has never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two software people are traveling on business. They try different night clubs and places, but all to no avail. My theory is that they are trying the wrong places - they go to more or less 'youth' nightclubs; They should try the type that has older people, more their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel is increasingly isolated and makes a small de Niro bet, as in Taxi Driver, and invites his friend / colleague to go and block some who has drawn a nice girl in the nightclub . Worth seeing.
