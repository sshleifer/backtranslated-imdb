I can admit that the script is not very good and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn to have fun. First of all, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria. Michael Douglas proves he still has it and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria play it Dynamic duo, both adding their amazing talent to the pot, and secondly, this movie is the funniest I've had this year in Theodore, it's easy and simple to go to the cinema and have a lot of fun watching The Sentinel.
