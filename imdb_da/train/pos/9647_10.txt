Deeply emotional. It cannot leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a love story between 2 18 year old boys. But it is only the body in this movie. And it has been removed. You only feel what happened to these boys. You feel the soul of the movie. With, of course, some action, some sex, but it's no pornography, too many emotions. It was only a summer story, and it became, from love to hatred, almost to death, the most important time in their lives. I loved it, you will too, regardless of your feelings.
