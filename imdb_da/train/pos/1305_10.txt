This movie took care of me when it started in a Cafe in Arizona and a Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", 04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered by a very hot, sexy waitress . While Rex exits the Cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him: "ARE YOU FAST?" and then hell goes loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill," 80, is a TV rep and always seeks a news scoop to broadcast. Maggie wins in a whirlpool, and Rex invites her to tell her he wants a show down, Western style, with the local chief policeman in town. This is another movie, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors to help this picture together!
