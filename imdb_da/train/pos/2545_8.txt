The invisible ray is an excellent display of both the actors of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff draws a flawless performance as a stupid and conflict researcher who seems to put his scientific achievements over his relationships with others, even his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid. Lugosi plays the accomplished professional who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to maintain good conditions with everyone, but still does not seem to have any real close friends. This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. However, it is difficult to hear his accent and believe that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science", but somehow even junk science does it well. Since the ideas and theories are quite idiotic, they are so "relevant" today as they were when the film was made. And they are also going forward - and will always be. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect movie to watch over and over again. I saw it maybe 5 times over the weekend and I could easily sit through it five times. The play is marvelous, and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
