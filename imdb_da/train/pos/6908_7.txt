Richard Dreyfuss stars in "Moon Over Parador", a 1988 Paul Mazursky movie starring also Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make a movie. When the dictator dies suddenly, the secret police officer (Julia) is the one who actually controls the dictator and the country, the draft Jonathan to play the dictator, having noticed the similarity between them. Soon, Jonathan will be enrolled in the palace as Alphonse Simm's, and Simm's prostitute girlfriend Madonna (Braga), who understands the shift promises to help him in every way she can. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, as featured in Simm's mother, gives us a look at how the CIA operates in third-country countries. Winters character, apparently a seller, is actually a CIA operative. However, the film flirts with, but does not really go on very serious grounds and is more of a send-up and a fun. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a great job as Jonathan the actor and the Alphonse dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing both. The beautiful Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia handles a wickedly fun performance like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It is one of those notions where you never quite know what the character is thinking - he can be comfortable or psyche at any time. Charo is present as a girl and manages to be fun and discreet at the same time. <br /> <br /> A really good movie, not a big block, but very entertaining.
