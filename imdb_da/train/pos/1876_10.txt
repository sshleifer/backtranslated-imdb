An adaptation of the book Finding Fish. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of her past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always great performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time, so it was overlooked. I highly recommend this movie to anyone you want to be touched by his story, and it really makes the audience empathetic with this young man, Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring true stories, see Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thanks
