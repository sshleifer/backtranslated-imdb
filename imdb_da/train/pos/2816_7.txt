This is an above average Jackie Chan flick because of the fantastic final and the great humor, but others then it is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool, and the movie is entertaining throughout, plus Jackie Chan is simply amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had great chemistry together, and both are very funny! And I thought the main opponent was really threatening! The character development is above average for this kind of thing! And the main battle is simply amazing! There is very silly and silly humor in this, but it amused me, and the end is fun! It's pretty cheap looking, but generally very well made, and although it doesn't have the amount of battles you would expect from a Jackie Chan flip, it does enough to keep you in mind, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) play around with a rifle and it goes out! This is an above average Jackie Chan flick because of the fantastic finale, and good humor, but others because it's not big, it's still worth seeing! The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a great job here with solid camera work, amazing angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace for the most part. The working is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as always and is great here, he is extremely sympathetic, funny as usual doing some crazy stunts, had amazing chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked it ass and played this wonderful cuddle character, he was amazing! , I just wanted them to stop copying him! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is fun as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a very good martial artist. The rest of the throw is OK, I guess. Overall, worth seeing!. *** out of 5
