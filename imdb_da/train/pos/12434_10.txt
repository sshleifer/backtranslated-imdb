For a first movie in a proposed series, it achieves the right balance. It's done in style and class that shows Modesty's early days as a refugee and the start of her ascent to power in the criminal world. I think it is a very honest / true portrayal of her character exactly as the author Peter O'Donnell intended. The Alexandra City as a Modesty is amazingly beautiful and an excellent choice. She seems very convincing as the hard survivor with an exterior of cool / intelligent / innocence. And full marks to Tarantino to choose an unknown actress for the role - much more credible to have a new face that creates that part. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
