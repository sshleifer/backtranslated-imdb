I probably saw this movie only in around 1995. Since then I have returned to it many times. It is well! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising." Wow! This was so cool back in the honorable days of the CG animation. CG is a bit older than I am, as I know the movie "Tron" was made 7 years before my time. But this movie was a landmark in the early 90s. It was probably the first collaboration with various CG experiments set to music. I like it so much, I think I will see it now. Goodbye
