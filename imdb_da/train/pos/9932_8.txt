If you go to this movie expect something, you will not be disappointed as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as the "iceberg effect". On the surface it simply struck a cache of random movie clips to make a movie. If this were written in a book, it would be a short story because the action in the movie is very quick and unless you actually try to capture it, the argument behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) may well pass you by. Absolutely a movie you'll have to watch twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this film. The camera work and post production adds a lot to the film's overall taste, making it quite artistic on some points and open to interpretation by others (something to be desired in American movies in the late days). While in some parts it may be a little rested, cruel and too heavy for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write as "need for improvement" is the audio track selection. No movie is ever good without an appropriate soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is a bit too long and the other rap songs in the movie could really have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have done this movie for a real trip). The flood of images and dynamic ... color palettes add another "artistic" aspect to it, also combined with the events happening throughout the movie, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. But it also makes it much more of a desirable movie to watch, and not one you will quickly get bored of. 8.5 / 10
