I am waiting for each new episode, each again running in anticipation! The new look of the sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season 9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season as I love his dry humor as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own unique to the show, making it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program for the next three years and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a bigger role for Asgard - they are just too cool.
