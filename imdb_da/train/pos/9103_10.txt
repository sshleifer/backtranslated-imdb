In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) as a career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you shop in a reverse way, you do not have enough space for larger stones. The five main characters in this movie are women who have not been able to organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting course of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954 -). Everyone tries to remove the stones that are insistent in their path or, worst, in their shoes. They are five Cinderella's in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story about these five Cinderella's is that of Anita (Monica Cervera), which also stars in "20 Centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir and Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia" .
