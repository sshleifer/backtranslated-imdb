Jiøí Trnka made his last animated card an accusation of totalitarianism, which gave him problems in his homeland of Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the symbolism simple, and his trademark ornaments are almost absent here, allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable. A man in his room dedicates to ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a big hand comes into the living room and orders him to make a statue by himself. The man refuses and he is pursued by the uninhibited glove. In those days, when the impact of the reality factor seems to be erased from most animations trying to replace the real world, it is refreshing to see a movie that makes its technique part of the pleasure.
