David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it already sounds strange to you, then you are right because it is. People are known for their writings with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc. He covered these issues in Bladerunner, unforgiving, and virtually all of his screens have something in that direction. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a fierce thriller. Not surprisingly, everyone has their other movies! And here is a fierce thriller with moral implications! The people's script is quite clear in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, learned to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left to death. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want him to be others, hate him, and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THERE ... <br /> <br /> ... The balls begin to fly as the new soldiers move on the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all people. Big, violent, powerful action follows and Folks script turns into an Anderson action party. It's hard to believe that the manuscript was originally written that way, but the end product is better than I expected. Entertaining, something, but not much, thoughtful and exciting when the action starts. 7/10 <br /> Rating R: A lot of violence
