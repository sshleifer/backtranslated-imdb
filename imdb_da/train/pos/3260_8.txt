People call this a comedy, but when I looked at it, I just laughed <br /> <br /> once. I suppose the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. There were a lot of scenes that were meant to be fun, but I was too worried about the characters laughing at them. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will find that despite a few stupid <br /> <br /> errors, it is one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
