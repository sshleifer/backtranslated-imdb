Oh, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, just a little better than the 1982 story of teenage business in North London (qv). By the way, I just looked at movie 4 [2008-12-21] and ruined my inability to set the PVR. <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with the added twist, it looks like a guerrilla piece of movie production from a team that apparently continues to make movies that are banned in the country where they are made (just think of the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun sets: quick reactions all around). <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to make me laugh aloud, but when the country soldier escorted one of the girls to the lows and forced her to wear an impromptu mask made by a Ali Daei poster, I couldn't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's calls for help ... <br /> <br /> Talking about the toilets, I just wish I could speak Farsi so that I could write the writing on the toilets walls (yes, there were a few fonts in Roman script, but they mostly referred to bad American rock bands). Also on rural Farsi theme, do you not think that Omid Djalili sounds like a yokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the custody of this movie and then go "Yup." I do not want to drill on the sexual policy in Iran and I will not drill on dubious trades; my love for this movie comes from the script and editing: top notch stuff. Here is a list of my best favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot in Glory 5. The Arsenal Stadium Mystery
