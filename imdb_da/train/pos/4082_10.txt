Hayao Miyazaki does not matter when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, but often compared to Walt Disney. It is just so unfair because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a gift from both adults and children, and Laputa is actually a great trip. <br /> <br /> But where can I begin to describe a movie so magically and breathtakingly! Miyazaki's works have never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a great adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: If you are a child who dreams of a fairy tale so large and so magical, how would it be? The answer would be to tie yourself in a seat and see Laputa, because it really is a fantasy in childhood that becomes reality. Every minute of the movie is rich and exciting ... from the duo to the amazing air-flying sequences ... and to the wonderful sight of the floating castles themselves. Not to mention the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever want from an adventure movie is here.
