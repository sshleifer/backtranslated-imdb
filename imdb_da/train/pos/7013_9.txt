With a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that draws on your heart strings harder than a rock guitarist amidst solo, "Seven Pounds" ran past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a girl I also loved. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name, because some of his films may skip by the unnoticed, if the actor associated with the project is not quite as profiled. <br /> <br /> I was out of the Will Smith scheme too early, putting two and two together as he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and stage when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as an incurable heart - disease. But I still believe that the author / instructor has chosen the right choice to put bookends (bookends is the first and last scene) in this way it is the source of urgency and tension in movies, where you gradually find out how exactly a man can be driven to the ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourish and evolve and always know in the mind what was present for these unfortunate two. <br /> <br /> One of my friends, with whom I saw the movie, thought Smith's character could have a divine gift and I understand why: his performance is almost the angel's when he is in his seven chosen Other times he can be harsh and scary and when he is alone he is full of his situation too much for him and he breaks down completely. It is quite a versatile achievement. Finally, I can't forget to mention the crash scene, which was re-enactment, which really got amazing in the form of movies that were paired with music. Put this on your list.
