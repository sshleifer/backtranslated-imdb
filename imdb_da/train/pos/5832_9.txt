Ever since I have seen this movie as a child, 30 years ago, I never dare to see it. From the opening scene in the horn factory to the car engine running from the back of the car to Ollie similar to the phone and accidentally pushing out of the window of Stan, I think this might be their best laugh movie. After that, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and while those movies were not horrible, they lacked the comic timing of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long-time foil, in his last appearance with the boys, shows up as the doctor is super! quote: "I said goat's milk" his answer to Stan asks him how do you milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up! All in all, I would say one of my favorite L&H comedies.
