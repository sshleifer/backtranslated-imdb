One must see! I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was fun. We speak nonstop laughing. It makes something about Mary look like an enchanting drama. Amanda Peet screams star quality with his winning combination of beauty, brains and serious action. Peter Cohen, the director, has made a cutting edge film showing the healthy inside of men's egos in the urban dating world. For all it's comedy, whipped successfully with that intelligence. It is so rare for a first-time instructor, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Judge, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber round off with cast depth and very strong performances as they would be smart ladies men. You will have to watch these guys go to work and get caught in the Peets web. Check out the trailer at whipped.com, it's worth 3 minutes download.
