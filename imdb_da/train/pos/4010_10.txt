In my opinion, this is one of the very best images of Superman on television, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular cartoon period. <br /> <br /> This series paid tribute to both the Superman movies in the '70s /' 80s and the Superman comics series 'Reboot' from 1986 onwards ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics "," Superman's Adventures ", etc.). The opening results and titles were stirred, based on the John Williams score from the movies, updated for a Saturday morning action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the major contributors to the comics reboot (author of "Superman's Adventures") was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series. Overall, the series had a more mature feel, while it was still very child-friendly. Superman was presented as trustworthy, strong and iconic. His recurrent nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. The Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy and Perry were portrayed well. One of my favorite looks was Wonder Woman, and the story was about her hometown Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her design and her mother Hippolyte were in line with the similar restarted Wonder Woman series series of era, and it looked as if an equally well-executed animated series could have been developed for her if it was treated the same. <Br /> <br /> The only thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
