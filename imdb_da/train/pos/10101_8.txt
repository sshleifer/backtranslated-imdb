The Dominion Tank Police is an exercise in conflicting film making. The story of the four parts blends mindless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought-provoking philosophical questions. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode. A must-see movie for anyone who likes anime.
