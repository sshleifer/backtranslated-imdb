What can you say about Elvira, who has not already been said in the world's press? The classic comedienne, Elvira, delivers in his first full-sized great comedy masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From the very first movie frame thingy, Elvira packs a play that clearly says Movie Great .... eat your heart out, Bette Davis! See an abandoned Elvira, see an exciting Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira. You can only do something to marvel at her performance! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire for the Las Vegas show star. Despite the fact that the "bubble goes back into boobtube" as a horror hostess (with the mostest), Elvira finds the little screen profile emotionally .... and physically! Nuff said she packs her kit bag and heads east .... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer outlining her heritage 'storm' in the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it properly .... (gloomy just wanted to show up)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, laugh yourself stupid, learn the lines .... <br /> Why she doesn't win the best actress Oscar for this role is beyond me.
