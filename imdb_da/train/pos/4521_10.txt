Julie Waters is always wonderful, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this angry sex-bound comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession and the changes he goes through when he is discovered. Unerringly, the vulgar, raucous scares light jokes for real white and real insights, and has an absolute ball while doing so. A very nice, low key, feel-good comedy
