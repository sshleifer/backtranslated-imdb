An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known, but they broke up hating each other. Over 20 years later they agree to come together for a TV special ... but find out they still hate each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> A big hit in its time, George Burns won an Oscar for the best supporting actor. I (a little) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, so its non-stop one-liners. Some of it was fun, but it wasn't fun at Willys and Als senility. Also I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor, and something about him just gave me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic that you quickly get sick of him. Everything that was gone was fun. Burns is just as good to throw off one-liners with ease and even Matthau was well matched to him. Their verbal struggles are the best sequences in the movie. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew tries to get the two of them to work with each other. For me, it's worth seeing Burns alone. This leap started his career in a big way, and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So that's good. Just good - not good. Matthaus's character makes it really hard to love. I give it a 7.
