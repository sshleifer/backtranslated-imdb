The movie is completely silly. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high-eyed intellectual movie based on a cartoon called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's play isn't exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I really enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that anyone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you just took it to surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There is a vicious Triad-style guy and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all this. A love interest. It's formal, but really, suspends disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you've logged on? Do yourself a favor if you see it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie almost incomprehensible conversation, but we got a big laugh at it. They seem to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I cried, I beat. I would see it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for the fighting situation in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass-lit pool table - I'd love to play on one of them. Get rid of me, but I'm digging on the trash.
