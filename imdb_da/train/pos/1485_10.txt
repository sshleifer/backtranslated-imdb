This movie contains personalities who so play their parts, I love the finals when no one knows what to do about their lives, but it is amazing when you see and realize that the pastor is right, jut for two what is doing the other people there? The film embraces you for a new life, for experiences, for dreaming with the other person and for achieving these dreams. Also shows you life itself, just as it is. But allow you to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. The movie it worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Beware.
