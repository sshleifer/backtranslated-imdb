Love Rosario Dawson, she believes is one of the finest actresses in the modern era. Descent seems to be more about self-awareness than anything else. It's the consistent undertone of everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the signs appear to be gentle and one-sided. The only consistency is the representation of self-awareness in the characters and Rosario's journey from self-awareness to loss of empowerment and back again. <br /> <br /> It is not appropriate to place this as a rape class and that is why so many people do not enjoy the movie. The standard "rape" didn't really like this movie, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it confronts the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a convincing relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not hit the audience across the face with self-righteous boldness, it goes into the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> Descent is a good movie that IMHO is heavily underrated.
