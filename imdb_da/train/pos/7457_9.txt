This is one of the best bond games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are very fun to play, they have lots of action in them, they can be very tough sometimes, making it even more fun The weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good, the driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story for it. Voice over the actors in this game is really good, and it's cool that piercing brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like how they look in real life, which is really cool. Also the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Total score ********* out of **********
