If you've read the books, forget about the characters Tolkien has built in your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarfs, etc. Have had the 'disney' treatment. The dark riders are excellent and I always imagined from the books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically, this is an excellent movie that blends vibrant movement and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. I only wish he (Bakshi) had made the money to complete his epic. It is worth having the video as they will be worth a while after the Ringses Rings 2001 !!
