This was a good example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and great effects. Just tell a true story about the two African American women's struggles during a turbulent century. This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are human, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
