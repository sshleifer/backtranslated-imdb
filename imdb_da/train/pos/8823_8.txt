Good movie. Tells you a boyish fantasy story that tells us how caught we are in social situations and what kind of extreme action to take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling that you have to break any rule if you have to break one. If you wanted to express love to someone you don't know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about fascism to decide for other cultural life, what kind of culture is attached to our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. Do not drink the morning coffee by yourself. Should we listen to NRJ shouting, see the stupid tabloid headlines and street advertisements before we even had our morning coffee?
