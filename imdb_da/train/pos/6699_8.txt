When Sabrina first appeared on our screenshots, I was about 12, and therefore spent my teens watching teenage witch come into all sorts of strange predictions. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite shows, the witches of the sixties sitcom 'Bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy going, which made her comfortable to see. The signs in the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, shame he left so early) Hilda and Zelda her aunts started ok but became so annoying. <br /> <br /> I also liked Mr. Kraft as he was always the little bit closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new spells, but as it became, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and remained, as Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then decided to do Sabrina in college, which ruined it for me. Sabrina was self-taught in college, there was less magic, no magic book, no aunts with her, and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring and I only saw what happened in the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong in one way or another, and Miles was just like that. The last episode made me feel much better, though (SPOILER) had Sabrina ending up with Harvey on her wedding day to dullard Aaron was amazing! All in all, a good program if you forget the poor last two or three series that reminded me of so many teen shows. Magical.
