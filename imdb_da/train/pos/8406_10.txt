In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, my parents just got the home box office that was quite new to our neighborhood. As a 12 year old boy it was the first time I watched breasts on TV. I will never forget the joy of these times. Racing vans, the total ass-dryer with the worst van, the watercraft, the spice curtain, the hot 70's chickens, 'all in my Chevy van song, was so new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you could hope for. I own it and enjoy it once a year. When I watch this movie, I get my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a waterline, go to the park and hunt some babies with springy hair. great memories of young people!
