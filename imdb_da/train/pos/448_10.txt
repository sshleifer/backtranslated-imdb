I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I refer not only to the breathtaking scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home life. Ultimately, four women rent the space together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. At this magically beautiful place, they find all the peace they long for, and interestingly, that peace comes from introvert reflections and decisions, more than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that develop out of kindness and understanding. The action is a joy to see in itself. I especially love the Lottie characters (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
