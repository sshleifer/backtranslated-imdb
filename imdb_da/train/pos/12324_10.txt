This movie is amazing. With large figures, especially the old swordman who can fly in the form of fireball and jumping over the trees, this film tells a classic story of the battle between evil and evil forces. The final showdown is particularly breathtaking, and the music score is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very advisable. Not for the smallest children. This one deserves a 10.
