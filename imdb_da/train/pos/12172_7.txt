This movie starts lively, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally goes well together, has a couple of very good moments, then peters out at the end of law 3. I could see this in LA premiered 2 times (with 2 different endings ). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrow's leading man. He is humorous and keeps his own, but he is better served as a supportive actor. Julia Stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new to her, but she 'does not steal' this movie as a star of her caliber should. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see her continue to do so "average" roles and then she doesn't have the role and run away with films (as Daniel Day-Lewis did in 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does an 'ok' job. I don't expect a prize for the academy from her and she didn't deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is 'above average'. Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I 'like' this movie! But it's not a movie where you go away and say ... "It was amazing!" ... This story has been done so many times before and there just wasn't much new here. The rehearsal scene was probably the best in the movie, and Larry Miller gives a great performance in a supporting role (he could be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to watch a movie that makes you laugh a couple of times and have a good night, I can still recommend this movie, but unless they have changed the end ... again ... leave under the church scene or you will will certainly be disappointed.
