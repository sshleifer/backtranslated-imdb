First of all, to defend JOAN FONTAINE, one must say that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly mistaken as Alyce, the young British lady who has the title role. Fontaine makes a snapshot of the heroine here, but her acting experience shows badly, and her dance is better left unincorporated. Fortunately, she continued to do better things. <br /> <br /> But here is Fred ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the best billing - and they are excellent. Fans of Burns & Allen will be amazed at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is the great fun house routine that won choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar. They join the Astaire in what should be the film's most inventive highlight. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, little can be said about the slow pacing of history - or some of the stupid situations that require much patience from the viewer. It has to be said that some of the humor falls flat, and the usual romantic misconceptions that occur in any Fred Astaire movie during this period are given conventional treatment. Only the musical interludes give the story the promise it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice Gershwin tunes come up once in a while, but not everyone gets the treatment they deserve. The cozy castings include Reginald Gardiner, at best in a polished comic book like a connecting servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father mistakenly as a gardener at Astaire). It's a bright heart when Burns & Allen is around to remind us how fun they were in their radio and television days. Both are surprisingly good at following Astaire's footwork. Director George Stevens makes sure Joan Fontaine's ground dance number with Fred is filmed discreetly, but smart camera work cannot spoil the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something she seems painfully aware of.
