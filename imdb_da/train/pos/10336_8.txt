This is hard to see - as a previous reviewer says. It is amazing considering the horrible films that came out just after World War II - especially the "liberation" of Dachau. Obviously, from the middle of the war, we knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The sequence showing a "transport" is alive, almost as if it is based on an actual news series (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He maps the course of a Nazi career. This mapping, in particular, when it stands in contrast to other Germans' reactions, first by laughing at Hitler, looked so incredible, and finally helpless. However, this contrast allows us to believe in "a transformation" of a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi attitude. It happened as a witness to the many attempts by Hitler, especially the Staffenberg plot that arose when this film came out. A strong movie that effectively uses flashbacks, accurate prediction of the Nuremberg paths and others that would occur when the war ended.
