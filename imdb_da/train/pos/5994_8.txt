I enjoyed watching the short film "The Cure", by first time director Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is the camera's work and music. I think many young filmmakers (like myself are one of them) would experience hard time filming when you just start making an indie. We see the production is not exactly what we imagined or under our ambitions. But this film, director's debut from a young director, is handled very well on the screen. The camera's motion, color, lighting, composition all contribute to the film's history and feelings. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element of movie language, also helps a lot. <br /> <It is difficult to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a map. However, I must admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narrative), especially when the movie is accelerated by narration, rather than shot and cuts. My personal feeling of some of the narrative part is, my guess was the narrator tried a little too hard. So the energy pushes the audience back from the film's feelings. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a short film nicely finished, I could see the input from a director. Way to go, Ryan! Greetings from China, look forward to your next one. <br /> <br /> hour
