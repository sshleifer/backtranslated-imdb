I considered, entranced and fascinated, by vocal and physical acting. The roles that each character played were made with excellence. The lyrics, the words, every gesture, the sunrise, told it all. The movie spoke to me. It informed me of another perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also held in disbelieve, by the victims and human dignity was portrayed. Power without grace, is denied and without emotion. Wanting power at the expense of humanity is so incredible. This movie made me so scared of the people who are no longer in this world. And it is with sorrow that I think of them. I like this movie for conversations and facial expressions for everything. May this movie be blessed.
