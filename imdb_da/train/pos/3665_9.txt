They did it. And boy did they do it great or what! The BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screens on a Saturday night where he belongs! And they did it in style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as author and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want, but is also an experienced writer in himself, so know what other people want. Another strength, perfectly shown here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character by Rose Tyler. Finally, the doctors' companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. Also great to see Auton's return - a nice nod to the Classic series there. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TO: "End of the World" - At the beginning of this dual bill you show TARDIS 'Forces, we end up in a story where special effects are all! They now have the technology to create real, credible environments and monsters - no more rubber suits of this kind! Also, hints at the end of this episode about the new doctor's past - very exciting to kill all the time-wasters and make him the only one. EPISODE THREE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We've had the future, now we have the past. The first non-Davie's written episode is somewhat flat in some places, but it is made by Simon Callow's Charles Dickens and the sudden twist of the plot when it is obvious that the pitiful Gelf is not so pitiful. EPISODE FOUR: "Aliens Of London" - The consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, not least with the consequences of Rose running away with him. We also have our first cliffhanger; not the best of them though. Slitheen is an interesting villain, although they can look for CGI for their own good. EPISODE FIVE: "World War Three" - The second part of this story of the Slitheen mainly suffers from the same problems of the first. Clips from the next episode that comes up at the end of the current episode are also annoying and damaging to people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We have had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we come to the good things - the return of the doctor's return. Here I think we can supplement Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant as a doctor and no more so in this episode where we see the pain in his face as he recalls the time war and the alien nature of him as he almost becomes a dalek himself. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "The Long Game" - really just a story to act as a prologue for the series finale. Saved by Simon Pegg as smarmy Editor and Tamsin Grieg in an entertaining cameo. The media controls us - it has never been done before, it has ... EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and heartache for Rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really hit the story. Full characters for Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "The Empty Child" - I do not find this child very scary. Sorry, but I don't. However, it's a good episode, but the cliffhanger could still have been better - it's the "next time" bits that destroy them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack, the dashing conman - he is a good actor who has been around for a while but only apparently noticed now. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "Doctor Dances" - Part 2 of this WW2 story - very well made in historical context. A fine optimistic conclusion, although it is a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when "Mummy" is revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest of the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad. A good return to Slitheen and also an interesting character study by Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - this starts quite silly, with some kindhearted humor and cheeky fun presentation on popular TV shows over her in Blighty. However, things become mortally serious quickly, and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THRITE: "Farewell to the Road" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A great doctor in so many ways that David Tennant really has to work with his socks to be as good as him. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh, and Dalek's back - in the extreme! God bless CGI because they would never be able to pull it out normally! <br /> <br /> Overall - brilliant! 9.10
