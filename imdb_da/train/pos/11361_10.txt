Although I saw this movie many years ago, its influence has never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His fear of not being able to stop death is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and give policies the opportunity to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x. Every day, when we are bombarded with mass murder stories, I think of this movie and the exhausting work people are doing trying to find the killers.
