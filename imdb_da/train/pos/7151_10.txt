I read Holes in 5th grade, so when I heard that they were making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, when I was my busy self, I didn't get the chance to watch the movie in theaters. Holes were at the driveway right out of town, but unfortunately we were just busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me! They all said it was good, but I've read good books that have made crappy movies, so I was totally worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the perfect opportunity to see it. It was out that week, and my parents went on a cruise and I was left for babysitting. My sister who is 9 and I saw it and loved it absolutely! I took it to the other people, I was the childcare house, and their children, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they are deffined film critics. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands family morals and loves a hilarious cast! This movie should be on your top 5 "two see" list !!!!
