I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it all. When a widow of two interrupts the sleep of his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing in him and not. As the terrible events unfold in this story, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons and about their destiny. With a shocking twist after shocking twist, this movie never allows a cradle in the plot. Bill Paxton plays his father, but the most notable performances are his older son, Fenton, as Matthew O'Leary and his younger son Adam played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I have seen for a while, and you would like to see this a few times to appreciate all the intricate aspects of the plot. I give this movie a 9/10.
