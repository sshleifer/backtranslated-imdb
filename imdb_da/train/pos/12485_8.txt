I just watched this movie and have to say I was very impressed. It is very scary and has many moments that make you jump out of the seat! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to soothe my nerves! If I were to criticize, I would say that there might be too many hopes if there was anything. It came to the point where each new scene climbed with a jump and this gradually turned away the horrible effect because you kind of new what came. <br /> <br /> Although it contains almost all the clich√©s in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the cruel, fear factor. It had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (especially the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!
