MacArthur is a great movie with a great story of a great man ?? General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of America's great military characters, and a figure is familiar to me from the earliest moment of my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be others) eg. MacArthur's speech, presented in the film as his 1962 address to the US military academy to accept the Thayer award, did not include the term "old soldiers never die, they just disappear." (It was in his speech to Congress about his dismissal of President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not observe the eye!) Gregory Peck is the im-Peck stand as the general who promised he would return to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II to the end of his career. This movie would have much greater significance for an acquaintance with both WW II and the Korean War. Nonetheless, Peck's portrayal of this great man who fought for the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as sole soldier is actually a memorable one. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
