Really good movie from Preminger; Labyrinthically at times, as it explores sets and locations from different angles and perspectives, as if it were a natural movie about citizens of the modern city and how they live. In that sense, it is visually and spatially satisfactory, as its hero, a good policeman with a bad mood, enters very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet and it has never been better. The story can be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As her girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes it a very interesting villain, with its natural warmth that contrasts well with Andrew's coolness; His smiling, graciously seemingly bad guy seems to challenge his nemesis all the time just by being emotionally open, unlike the closely-wounded and moralist policeman pursuing him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this movie that appear to be transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger, it is a reunion of varieties with its Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who passed their career peaks around the time the movie was made. The support model - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic as they were all coming up. Premises that see an observer as always allow the events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, since the moral ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and the mouse game between the two antagonists seem larger and more archetypal than any single film could contain much less loose. <br /> <br />
