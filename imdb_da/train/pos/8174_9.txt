I love this movie. As a child, this was one of the first films I saw that made me feel good. Sure, it's mild now, but back in the day it was great. Dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheeses, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I've always had a love of medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfect, no one could have done better. And for a low budget horror movie, the effects and such are quite good. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this one playing a nosy cop and doing a fine job. There is a lot of blood and some really cold torture / death scenes. Check this out!
