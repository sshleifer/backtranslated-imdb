This is a script that Ed Wood worked for over 10 years trying to get done. Aris Iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that Wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other, more cautious valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a dialogue-free movie that some may foolishly describe as silent. In fact, it is a rather noisy movie without most flicks inane chatting. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich sound experience that works better than almost anything from Hollywood's script mill, especially the silly boat movie Billy Zane was last in ('Watch out!', 'Oh no!' - J. Cameron. ... not me). I take Zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this movie of empty dialogue every day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players who of course really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is brilliant as always, and the gods shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy's name on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and Ron Perlman's beastful performance is simply wonderful. Overall, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and cinenephile. A must see for anyone who really loves movies like the first movement Iliopulos and his throws of course does. A movie to make you wish you had made it yourself.
