Brown of Harvard is a tough movie to pine down. We expect much more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that the audience in their 20s was a little more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even honesty. All the relationships in the movie feel very stolen apart from the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city's geek. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It is a good education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
