This is a film about Italian artists of the 17th century and an artist, especially a woman Artemisia, an unheard-of profession for women at that time, and she dared paint male nude with in detail her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> Camera work is mainly indoors, because this is where the artists primarily worked. There are some good shots. Candlelight close-ups indicate the beautiful work of classical painters, and it is fascinating to see painters and their students, supported by elaborate scaffolding, brushing in details on religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are quite authentic, because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is urged by his father to study under the great Florentine artist Tassi, who has become an expert in perspective and landscape painting (something completely new), but the unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting. Tassi has raped her raped her after her. Her father is upset. Legal proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across a field with the wind waves their bulky clothes add wonderful effects. Artemisia says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others. With regard to this movie, it will most satisfy, I think.
