Okay. Yes, it was a very tight budget film with continuity errors (as single scenes appeared clearly in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso, he was often a little too good at the burned-out part, and some of the less-supporting cast were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but eye-catching roles). But get on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very likeable. Mancuso had some good lines while Nancy Allen ironically was completely gentle and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes I would have loved to have been on the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you quick?" ... "You don't have that fast."
