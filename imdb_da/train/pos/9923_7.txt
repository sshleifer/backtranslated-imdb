I read several mixed reviews and several of them carefully watched the movie. I was initially interested in this project because it was led by Tony Scott and I have become very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a great influence on me. Before I begin my review, let me first say this ... it's great to see that this movie could have been told in a dull and ordinary way, but the authors and Scott chose another approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> It's just said it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide 'tried and true' reasons they know will connect with people, often ensuring audience acceptance of the movie and creating a higher likelihood of profits. This plot was one of the more interesting things I had seen for a while. Just for reference, I recently saw 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War', and while I say that these movies are excellent and I enjoyed them both, both plotters in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. They do not take a chance and they are very predictable after seeing a lot of American movies. Domino's plot is both interesting and told in a way that keeps you in mind: "Oh man, they're screwed now". And I feel it is lacking in many recent films. In my opinion, it has a lot of depth and gives you lots of things to ask questions while you see it. All in all, this is what kept me so interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Draw: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were correct. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but inside and wished to be considered what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever she needed to do. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very trustworthy, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of love, as well as his jealousy questions in the team ... they all rang right to me, which made me to feel that his character was so much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still sounded right to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy and tried to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to do with him, because that's what I got out of it. He did a very good job of showing Ed in an average Joe kind of way that made his mistakes, but still tries to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I think they gave the necessary heart to the story. They weren't just people who didn't have the money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem, and they were looking for others to reach that goal. You could empathize with them because for them this child's disease was a problem without any other solution. These signs should show real people who are less fortunate to get into this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The mobsters: They made history seem scary in a way that only the mob can. And I really liked that part. They also padded the story with small complexes that made the plot so much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 guys: <br /> <br /> They gave the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. From Walken's awkward statements to the incessant references to the 90210 guys who have prayers. Their involvement in the movie made it just so much fun. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... the film. This is where this movie seems to have lost many potential fans. But in my opinion, I thought it was genius that the use of the camera to translate the mood of the present situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. I welcome both, and congratulate Scott, the editor, the film photographer and the photographer for taking some real chances with this movie. Not only did they go far with their presentation, they went much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark, gave the film's "look" with a creepy and grungy look that accurately depicts mobs, bounty hunters and the less fortunate lives in a way that shows their lives are not ' t like peach or "clean" like everyone else. If you notice in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and didn't just do it. I realize that most people who watched this movie did not expect it, and it causes many of them to be rejected for this movie, but I think it was good that Scott took this approach. Hollywood movies have grown predictably and bland. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same terms. And I'm glad Scott was trying to do something different. <br /> <br /> Granted, this movie is not for everyone, but to say it's garbage and has nothing to offer, completely missing the point. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money on it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it only hits a chord with a few. I have to agree with a previous poster when he said that many of those who refuse to look outside the MTV sphere will not appreciate this movie, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for Scott and Co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he managed tremendously.
