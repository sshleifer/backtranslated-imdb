The movie opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend - making the client - Jim Blanding (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed in a small New York apartment with not enough closet space and too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, exec Jim announces love for (or falls for!) An ad for a house. When he has bought the house, the bills and frustration rise unbroken, as all that goes wrong with the construction of Jim's 'dream home' goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy - not much taxation, with no really good news, but a great way to spend an hour or two. It is laughing right from the start when the alarm clock goes off, and Jim tries to shut it down, only to be met at every turn of Muriel. Timing and delivering comic lines and situations can only be given by a few spicy pros, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry and much fun. Myrna Loy is in a rather immeasurable role (it is clear that Grant's character Jim gets the lion's share of the lines and play, and Grant always pulls out with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel a color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give character. Melvyn Douglas also plays scary entertainment to perfection, and never hits a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes has certainly been when Bill gets himself locked in the "store room" and Jim goes to 'save' him ... just to get everyone caught inside! Every little problem that arises for the Blanding renovation project - including petty jealousy and an advertising campaign for 'Wham' - seems to bring everything that * could go wrong with building a new house, but making it credible and a comfortable watch. 8.10
