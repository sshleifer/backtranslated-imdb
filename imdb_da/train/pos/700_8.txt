An insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made movie. I loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer ... the actor was top notch - honestly, I wanted to see Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - But everyone else, especially the young girl, was also good. I was also very impressed with the film's appearance. Usually, "independent movies" have a grainy, I-shot this on-my-camcorder, but they expect what she's doing. The lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to a Tess Nanavati function!
