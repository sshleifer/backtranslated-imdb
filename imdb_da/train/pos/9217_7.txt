This really funny movie has a zany cast of characters, virtually all successful middle-aged women in Hollywood and a touching, fun love story. Capomezza and Malacici are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also opposite - extreme - ends of the taste scale. Their children are cast in the main roles of a church production by Romeo and Juliet. Of course they fall in love. On the stage! The hope and confusion that this causes, as the parents celebrate with each other and their children, is played out to us against Capomezas beautifully tasteless home and their tastefully tastefully arranged weddings. the four over-the-top parents and the charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, an ordinary grandmother, a lady who waves a string and passes on spiritual advice, she receives from a medium called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car and two pigeons. There is no eye gag or a punch line that does not click into this fast movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low-brows" and "Malacici" could mean "fixed snobs". <br /> <br /> If you're sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you don't like this movie. If Bette Midler scares you, you don't like it because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us will love it!
