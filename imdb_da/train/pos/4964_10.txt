I really love this show really! I always wanted the 1990s play by Space Ghost! This show was fun and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a fun show like this from the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who live their everyday lives with his mother and father and his best friend who likes to fall into much, Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good song voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak made of singing at all. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak do not finish their homework, and then they go back from Sunday to Friday, and they just go off and then go back to the day that homework was invented and then they going back to current homework did not exist! Another episode I like is the one in which Brak's Dad and their neighbor, Thundercleese Robot, continue to enter this argument, and then they are eaten by a huge worm. Another episode I liked was the one in which Zorak is making a hoop stand and then took a new guy over his stand. I also like many of the other episodes! One thing that never makes me laugh is when Zorak gets up, blown and zapped!
