With an all-star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of horror images, "The Sentinel" (1977) is nevertheless an effective scary movie centered on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, moving into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is (and I don't think I give away too much at this late date) very close to Hell's gate. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers much worse conditions than leaks and an occasional water bug, to say the least! In fact, the scene where Alison meets her noisy upstairs neighbor is really scary, and it actually has to send the ice water running down into most viewers' tips. Despite many critics complaining about Raines' ability to function, I thought she was fine, more than keeping herself in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture is based on a really scary conclusion, and although some plot points go unexplained, I was left to feel more than happy. As the book "DVD Delirium" puts it, any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards cannot be too bad! "On a side note, I went yesterday to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to look at Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and though it is cut off its heavy goblet and lacks a blind priest / non in the top window floor, it looks a lot like it did in this picture If this house really is at the entrance to hell, I'll take it as hell ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway But we New Yorkers have known it for a while!
