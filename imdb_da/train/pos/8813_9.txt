Although the pieces are uneven, this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience. There were some who, in the wake of the feelings of the bombing anniversary, took this to be anti-American. I don't think that's the case, though some parts can be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious. In the end, the film is nothing more than an attempt by people to express their confusion, sympathy and feelings about what happened. It's stories of people who are worlds, shaken up by what happened on a Tuesday in September. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie will move you, probably to tears. It is not always easy to see, for example, the film from Mexico is a little more than a black screen with sound, but its effect is such that one can lay the strongest of the people themselves. If you can be strong, you should really watch this movie. It will comfort you and enlighten you and influence you ...
