Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horror show. After finding out that her dead aunt has left her some things, elvira goes to England to retrieve it, hoping it will be some money. But for her horror Elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyway, but with her striking dark appearance and her amazing features she cannot live in peace. All the neighbors are now facing the whole city against her, and with Elvira's outrageous attitude and appearance, everyone looks better because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's great fun to see Elvira into all those adventures, she's just amazing. The whole movie puts you in a halloween mood, it's probably stupid and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to see it. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
