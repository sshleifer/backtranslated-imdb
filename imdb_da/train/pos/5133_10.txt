Each of the large studios donated jazzy one-reelers through the thirties and eighties (with Universal at the forefront). While most looked as cheap on the screen as they were supposed to do, Warner Bros. depicted (which suddenly stopped making them in 1946) often their sharp camera angles, mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative instructors like Jean Negulesco. It is appropriate that the best of this genre should come from this study. What sets "Jammin 'The Blues" apart from the rest of the package is more like an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms a regular jam session into a "trippy" dream escape from wartime problems, highlighted by the melody "On The Sunny Side Of The Street". Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later to work with Hitchcock) were allowed artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller, and the studio could fit less how he and his fellow players were presented. The optical printer is used well, with more images of the same performer appearing at once. (Norman McLaren really milked this process two decades later in "Pas De Deux" while Linwood Dun's team achieved various effects in the Citizen Kane.) The strong emphasis on silhouettes and lighted cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time; in some ways the psychedelic sixties, but with a distinctly forty film noir style.
