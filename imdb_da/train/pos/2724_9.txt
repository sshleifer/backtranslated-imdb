Many of the classic films from the late 60s have not retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" has not lost an ounce of its power. Its exceptionally well done yet forces the viewer to think. Some have not only complained about the movie, but about Truman Capote's source "non-fiction novel" that the central message is uninhibited. It may be true, but it is certainly a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detract from the film at all. It is refreshing, especially in view of today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to watch a movie with a convincing political voice that is not afraid to force the audience to consider its point of view. To be honest, I am not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its inconsistency anyway. Even if you disagree with the death penalty notice, there is plenty to admire about the movie. The action of the two leaders is amazing. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) chiller as the nihilist leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake also chills as the more submissive of the two and with a conscience. His character obviously has a sense of reason but is afraid to go against Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtitle on his character's part). The cinematography is amazing, slim and yet gritty and gives the real impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
