Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a successor, I love Jaq and Gus so I didn't hesitate. The format of the mice that wrote a book for Cinderella was an inspired one. I enjoy writing stories myself and hope that children will be encouraged by this. The three stories are cute and fun, even though the songs were unforgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, Mice Chorus and the rest. Pom Pom showed the perfect companion for Lucifer, and I liked the Governance. A successor made the right to a change. My rating 8/10.
