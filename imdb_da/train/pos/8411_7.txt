This early version of the story 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this movie, he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old movie to watch them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man making a covenant with him for gold - the gold he needs a count He has previously been rescued from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (movie runs just over an hour) and quite well-written and characterized, the 'Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde starting with a covenant with a mysterious figure of potential evil and evolving into good and evil sides of the same person.
