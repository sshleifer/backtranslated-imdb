This movie is one of the most underrated films of its time. When you watch this movie, you are full of action, and when something doesn't really jump, humor is un-matched. Brilliant writes for a movie made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are participants and a near future where the public all have a thirst for blood. Also, Arnold does not let us down with some of his best one liners. . Hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.
