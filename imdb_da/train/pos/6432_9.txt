Thanks to a smart script and a stable hand from Writer / Director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very sympathetic mystery thriller. The film starts methodically and builds steam as the tracks begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great as they join together to unearth the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, from the "Thin Man" films. Kathleen Quinlan is great as Alex McArthur's troubled wife and character roles played by veteran Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris, are well-finished and provide lots of easy moments at the right time. There is even a como of Rex Linn. All in all, I felt like I was reading a good book by the fire.
