I just saw "behind bedroom doors" and that was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it, which I have seen for some time. We begin with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer running for a lawyer, Lillian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Got all that? Now let's get into it. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played beautifully by the porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents the house across the street from Fenways and lives all alone. At the beginning of the movie, James looks out of the window and sees Abby engaging in playing time with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by the naughty porn Monique Alexander), and secretly wonders how it would be with her. The next day, Abby becomes acquainted with all four of them, and appears to be a lovely woman who just happens to live an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass on Vivian, who seems frightened and says to her: "Oh ... I'm ... not the way." Everything seems okay until the plan is up and running. First, Abby arrives at Gabe's office, naked and asks Gabe if she should get a boo work. Here we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ..... let me guess. Your wife stays home and does everything you ask. But she's a good girl." "Yes." "She's not a bad girl?" "None." "Does it die a lock on it?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next .... Abby gets it on with Gabe, right there in the exam room. Then she puts a little show in her window to James, who comes by and doesn't waste time having sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye really is a camera that loses all the celebrations (it's so obvious anyway). Abby has sex with Gabe again later, and this time Gigi goes together to make it a three-way. Now that Abby has something on both men, she asks $ 100,000 from each to buy her silence. Not only could she destroy James' run to the office, but she could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James break their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - as "experimented" with college women. It was a long time ago, but you wouldn't know to see her in action with Abby - she looked like an old pro. While Gigi goes along with the plan, she seems jealous for all sexes her boyfriend has. "It's only business," says Abby. Apologies and apologies are sure to follow, as are some great information about Abby's true identity - it seems like she has done the same with different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight back against Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now on to sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this movie except Julia Kruis has a long porno background, I wouldn't have expected anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best of the movie, with the three-way coming in a close second. Monique Alexander was only naked once, but she was a relatively small character. Julia Kruis was a great character and became naked the same number of times. I suppose when she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she didn't have to have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To unpack, "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a great story that enhanced the overall character of the movie. I consider it invisible. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than her later offerings in Fred Olen Ray's comedies. At least she can do some drama. Chelsea Blue was a scene stealing - she was not as bad as the antagonist, I would give her an A alone. Julia Kruis was her usual self, but I wish Monique Alexander had more face in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Massive , very solid sex scenes Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost hardcore quality, Chelsea Blue also looked good in her scenes, the two girl girl offers were not burning, but they warm up the screen.) History: B + (I liked the dialogue and main story Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's drama tour. <br /> <br /> All in all: B (This was a nice softcore flip. I'm glad I could See this when I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue ever wanted to do more of them, she would v welcome anytim e. This also applies to Nicole Sheridan - although she is probably better at making comedy. I don't mind hardcore girls who can trade softcore movies.)
