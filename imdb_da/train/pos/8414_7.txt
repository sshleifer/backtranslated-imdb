The 'Student of Prague' is an early dramaturgy with dramatic drama, or rather it is an "autor film" (ie an author's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements who have tried to exploit respect for cinéma, or just gain merit by adapting literature or theater on the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book of moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it is centered on the doppelganger theme. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the most cinematic movie that has the double exposure effect causes Paul Wegener to appear twice in scenes. Guido Seeber was a special-purpose guide for his day, but he is not very good at placing the camera or moving it. Film director Leon Hunt (published in "Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative"), however, has made an interesting analysis of this movie using framing to enhance the double theme: characters are split by left / right, near / far and frontal / diagonal framing of characters and shots. Either way, the film consists mainly of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; There is very little scene dissection and scenes dwell. None of this is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced films in that regard around the same time, including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom, 1913), 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913) and DW's short film Griffith. <br /> <br /> An expanded universal movie vocabulary in 1926 would allow for much better remake. Furthermore, remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character, except being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here the obtrusive acted lurks around, apparently with an invisible cloak. I know their world is silent to me, but I assume, with their lips moving and so that their world would not tolerate them, so how can Lyduschka learn about the shoulders of others and not be noticed? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the main mind behind this movie, besides playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct 'The Golem' in 1920 - helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent cinéma. <br /> <br /> (Note: The first version I considered was about an hour long (probably not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and so. I'm not sure who was a distributor .I have since also seen the Alpha DVD, which in 41 minutes lacks recordings in the above print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not that bad. The repeated score is best muted, though.)
