Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they each live their faith every day and soon have Azariah dedicated to God in their church, with their two older boys watching. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist destinations in Australia. The family does not rent close to the place if they are not wealthy. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy hurries to the tent, a dingo dog is just exciting and shakes his head. The child is gone and soon it's also dingo. Although the whole camp looks after the child, she is not found. Finally she is dead and that dingo was releasing with their beloved child, comrades trying to accept God's decision and continue with their lives. But unfortunately, the story gets a sensational coverage in the news media, and soon the story tells that Lindy murdered the child. She is then arrested and tested. How could it happen? This is a great portrayal of real events that show how "mob rule" is not a fantasy of imagination. The whole country faces Chamberlains, partly because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strong will counteracts every single step. Neill also does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. Cast is one of the greatest ever, depicting people around the country who get their graves in Lindy's case. Costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are at the top of the line. If you have never seen or heard about this movie, correct it immediately. It is not far from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by anyone who cares about movies and about the media's abused power.
