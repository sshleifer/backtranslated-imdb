My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name that I bought around 1993. I read the linern notes and the band said the album still in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarrington's book . <br /> <br /> I took the book up a few months later and devoured it! An amazing reading! I have since read the book many times, each time finding something new for Desmond and his desire to complete the whale music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996, on video. I haven't had many good experiences with Canadian movies, but this one has worked for me. Claire's role could have been widespread differently, but generally I believe that Paul Quarrington's vision was transferred nicely from the book to the screen. Maury Chaykin provides a moving performance like the isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands. I would highly recommend "Whale Music" for not just music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world.
