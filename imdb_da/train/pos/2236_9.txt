What I remember most about this movie is that it used to fly on local KTLA TV (Ch. 5) during each Christmas season in the mid to late 70s, mainly because the true story took place on or near Christmas Eve. It was always a little disturbing to see hell that this girl goes through as the only survivor for a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The young girl's graphic scene pulling leeches out of her infected legs made a good impression on this young seer. Not quite the kind of Christmas greeting I was used to seeing at that time. Absolutely not a Rankin-Bass production.
