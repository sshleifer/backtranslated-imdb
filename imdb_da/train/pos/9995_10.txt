This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on and with your feet up. It does not require as much brain power to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious then you won't bother, but it's very fun. Just the idea that a businessman would go as far as agreeing to live in a slum for a while and then actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
