First of all, I'm not a Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a big Justin fan, but I liked this movie. I work at a video store, and when I watched this movie with its big throw that I had never heard of, I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's performance so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a beautiful impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott, there are two names that didn't even make the first credit list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovers the corrupt police, but I found it well done. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflict, but I honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman, as always, is the wise mentor, he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPACEY, he was just there. Her character didn't have a lot of stuff, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can't do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop, really trustworthy and really in character, he freaked me out a few times. I really expected a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Terrible catchphrases, unwarranted action sequences, things like that, but it was surprisingly well done, and I didn't find any of it. Every shoot had a point, it wasn't clich√©d, pretty solid really. <br /> <br /> Overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't perform in theaters, it was better than any garbage I've seen on the big screen. I'd say it's worth seeing.
