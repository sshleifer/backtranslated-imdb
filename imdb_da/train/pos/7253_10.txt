Not sure you can call this an anti-war movie, it shows war at an elite level. It's elite soldiers who know what they do and trust. Even when they are pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and defeat their enemies, even though it is against being a pacifist. The films are slow and quite unintentional and in many ways quite pretty, since war films go more into today's standards, no body parts fly like in modern movies. It is brutal in other ways, even if you see killing a personal plane. This is more of a thinking man's movie. When you begin to see you, you will not miss anything. Men's thoughts in the film and their interactions are what the film is about - not the fight itself or a great exciting story. This may be called a warrior's warrior. <br /> <br /> If you are in war skills, if you are reading or watching programs about SAS and so on, you will see this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparing movies is The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49. Parallel (1941) with a star star, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. Everyone is unusual in their path and shows war on a personal level. Enjoy!
