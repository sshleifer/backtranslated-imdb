Paris is the place to enjoy beautiful art and music, and to fall in love with love - as is the case with this movie. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, but something stands in the way of eternal happiness, the classic story. The amazing music from George Gerschwin complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "An American in Paris" is a humorous, merry and loving movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
