The Woman In Black is amazing in every aspect. It is scary, exciting and so realistic that you can actually see it happen in real life. I saw the first on the TV in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume up, it was probably the most eerie experience of my entire life. I managed to grab a copy and now I make sure to bring it out every Halloween and show it to unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they are up to and all I can do is laugh at joy . As for the movie: <br /> <br /> It starts with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is assigned by his company to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to settle a recent deceased client's papers - Mrs Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. But then Arthur takes the funeral, and from that scene we are not safe. We are constantly on the edge and biting our nails, and it goes on to the next hour or so until the final exciting final. <br /> <br /> A warning to all new viewers, though: don't see this alone. ..
