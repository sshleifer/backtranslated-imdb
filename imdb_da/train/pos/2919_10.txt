I watched the movie twice over a week, both times at a movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. From the start of the movie with Henry Winkler getting 'wounded' on the football pitch, the entire audience was upset with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this movie is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you've never seen him before. Also look out for a very well-known actor whose trademark wrestling moves is a head-but! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance watch this movie and it's family comedy entertainment at best!
