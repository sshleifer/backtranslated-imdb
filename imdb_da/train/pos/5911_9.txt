Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was an animator at Terrytoons looked at Paramount Cartoon Studios after he was director of Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, that's Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racist, but good. The movie takes place in Harlem Nights (No, hey, it was a working title.) But with a twist that becomes a lampon of a Disney movie, the South of South. <br /> <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but is stopped by a roadblock and ends in a shootout with the police . While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to colleague Escapee Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy a story of "three guys I used to know just like you and your friends". Pappy's story is told in animation against live-action background images and recordings. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (Thomas Voice), Brother Bear (White Voice) and Priest Fox (Voice Gordone) decide to unpack and leave their southern settings after the bank has pledged their home and sold it to a man making it a brothel. Arriving in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox find that it is not all it is made to be. They encounter a king named Simple Savior, a false revolutionary leader who claims to be "cousin" of the black Jesus, and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill white". In a flashy play in his "church", the Savior seems to be brutalized by symbols of black oppression represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon before asking his parishioners for "donations". <br /> <rabbit first faces Madigan, a virulent racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia, demonstrating his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an expected meeting with them (he believes they are not worth it). When Madigan finds out that the rabbit has taken its payouts, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts him while an LSD cane has fallen into his drink. Madigan is under the influence of his nail drink then maneuvered into a sexual relationship with a stereotypically widespread homosexual man and then pushed into clothing that women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned with something racist and finally pushed out the back of the club where discover that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> When he recovers from his delirium of being drugged, he accidentally shoots his gun and is shot dead by the police after shooting one of them. Rabbit, Bear, Fox and opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up. The live action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while being shot by various white police, but manages to make it alive. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial at the time of its release and was revised by the director several times under the title Street Fight, which is obvious as Street Fight is a documentary from the 2005 street racism. In fact, this film has the same subject as the documentary. <br /> <br /> It caused Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this movie and the original Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to leave the business. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this movie, but because of racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth entertaining. The animation was amazing at the time, the plot makes sense, and it's actually fun too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VALUE: 9/10
