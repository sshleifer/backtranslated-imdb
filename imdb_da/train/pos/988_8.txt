I liked this movie. When the guy who was in a bank accounted for $ 40 million in gold, his cellular parent dies as "bait" to lead them to the high tech crazy killer partner (having a surveillance unit implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). It's an action, spy type movie with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of Enemy Of The State. Well done and good enough plot.
