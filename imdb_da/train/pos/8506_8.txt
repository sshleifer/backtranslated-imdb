. . .but it was on a UHF channel and reception was very unclear. I really want to own the movie when I first saw it because I'm a bus driver, and when I saw this movie, I drove the model bus. It was only (during his attempted murder some 15 years later) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it. I just remember that he was the driver and the bus' fired up and drove wild. I have looked over this movie to no avail since it was seen in the mid 80s. I liked the movie, I usually do not see thrillers, but after reading the summary in the guide and in the beginning (though unclear), I remained for the whole.
