At one level, this movie can bring the child into us who just want to build sandcastles and throw things in the air just to see it fall back. At a deeper level, however, it explores a deep desire to reconnect to the country. I followed closely with the artist when he said, "When I'm not here (alone) for some time, I feel untouched." <br /> <br /> I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. I know his works mainly through his coffee tables and a few art galleries. But to see his work going, captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer's objective, was a revelation. Unsuccessful over time, Goldsworthy's creations come alive, swirling, flying, dissolved, crumbling, crashing. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly what he's all about: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Of coming and disappearing. To get out of Void and become the Universe and back again. There is a shamanic quality about him who goes mad. You get the feeling of looking at him at work that his art is a life force for him that if he didn't, he would rest and perish. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. Otherwise, they would only exist for a person with the exception of a few cairns and walls.
