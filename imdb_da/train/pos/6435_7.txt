I think most of those who have commented on this movie do not understand how to watch movies and / or have little sense of elegance. First, to evaluate a movie, you need to understand the extent to which everything in the movie works together. Modern emotions require great drama. No, I do not mean great setting of signs and plots, but they seem to require emotional paths that are very tragic or very comical. This is a subtle movie. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It's a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, kindness ... you name it. The world it is set in would be foreign and not understood today ... a world where if you have it, you must flaunt it NOW and HIGH even if you only think you have it. <br /> <br /> Today, many people do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people understand that concept today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps set the record straight.
