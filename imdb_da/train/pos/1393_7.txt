Probably the most capricious installment in the first season, "Shore Leave" has its ups and downs; some parts need too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one cannot deny that they threw everything, but the foolish kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect plane for land leave after an extended trip has left everyone on board needing rest, relaxation and so on. It seems for every purpose and purpose to be an uninhabited land with beautiful nature and an ideal climate. The first indication that things may be a little weak is when McCoy, who is leading an advance, spots Alice (from Wonderland) after a big white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk beams down and finds the others who report similar bizarre happenings and meetings. The only thing they all have in common is that each crew member thought of the person / place they discovered just before they discovered it. This does not immediately sink with Kirk or anyone else. More oddity follows, including observations of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc. Kirk meets with Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his academy days, Finnegan. Chase / match scene with Finnegan continues for too long, but at the same time, McCoy runs through a lance of a knight on horseback and apparently killed. Finally, an older man appears and explains what has happened. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors can only imagine something to make it look. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. When this is explained, Kirk decides to order a beach law for everyone. In spite of 'it was a dream' as a kind of end, 'Shore Leave' stops like another first-class episode of Star Trek's first season.
