A clever, unthinkable entertaining crowd with Peter Ustinov as a career fisherman with his sights set on a US conglomerate in London. He is supported by the foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure of the jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a lift film with many brains. Ustinov is unusual, as Smith and Newhart are quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, who the pill pops "Executive Vice President." Malden has rarely been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley show up in some funny comos. The excellent music score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is lively, and the manuscript from Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first-class and very smart. A swinging good time!
