It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rolling children. I felt like instead of a movie, I should have got a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> Based on Thomas Rockwell's respected book, Fried Worms begin to eat like any children's story: Move to a new city. The new kid, fifth-degree Billy Forrester was once popular but needs to start over. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only view is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, which is 4 1/2 feet, is a huge one. Further complicated things are Joe Bully. His freckled face and annoying shirts are scary. He discourages children with the death ring: a Cracker Jacket that rumors about killing you if you are beaten with it. But not immediately. No, the death ring releases a poison that kills you in eight classes. <br /> <br /> Joe and his evil axis bid Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once it has been discovered, Billy plays cool, swears he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Ewww! To win them past Billy reluctantly, he can eat 10 worms. Fried, cooked, marinated in hot sauce, squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is called an exotic name like "Radioactive Slime Delight", where the children finally live out of their dream of microwave a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will know that I have an uncontrollably grin. I felt like a creep that breaks out on a young child laughing that his "dilly dick" hurts. But Fried Worms are wonderfully disgusting. As a G-rated Farrelly brothers movie, it is both caste and lovely. <br /> <br /> Author / director Bob Dolman is also an experienced historian. To raise the effort, the worms must be consumed at. 19:00. In addition, Billy has a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a good sense of perspective. With such accuracy, he draws on children's insecurity and the tendency to exaggerate earthly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you were to hyperbolize this movie, how the kids do their quandaries, you'll see it's really about war. Freedom fighters and freedom hats use pubescent boys as a farmer in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn one or two things about global peacekeeping from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed, "It was a great movie." databases.
