I watched this movie for the first few weeks it was out (I can't remember exactly when.) I thought it was okay for a Ben Stiller movie. This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, think of them. Or as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this site I saw that people didn't have any good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating, but I would have given it a bigger one. This movie thought I was very good and it should have got a better rating. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I just give you another person's opinion.
