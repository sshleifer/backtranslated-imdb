After a cold sex scene between Andy and Gina in South America, do we know that Andy is a salary teacher who finds himself in a tough financial situation where he needs a lot of extra money? We also find that he has stolen from his job and spent the money on his drug habits ?? He also tries to keep up with his wife, who can just have an affair? <br /> <br /> To solve all their problems, he persuades his brother ?? a sympathetic loser ?? to come with him in a plan to steal their own parents' small shop ?? Their parents are happily married and holders of a jewelry store located in New York's Westchester County ?? Sixty thousand dollars is all they have to get their lives out of desperation? <br /> <br /> Three main characters are important in this movie ?? <br /> <br /> First the two brothers ?? Each of them is a complex individual, threatened by more motivations and immersed in doubts and disappointments ?? The two are desperate characters, economical and emotional? <br /> <br /> Andy is selfish ?? He feels he has never loved his father? He is the devastating influence, makes his brother an attacker and his beautiful woman a pride? <br /> <br /> Hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes ?? His former wife is one of the reasons why he needs money when he owes her hundreds in child support. He longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father? <br /> <br /> The third character is their tired and deplorable father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in the joking climax scenes. <br /> <br /> Telling you more about the details could reduce the impact of the movie and hence the entertainment ... Tomei's performance gives great depth and sense even to her appearance, her touch, her particular movement? <br /> <br /> Lumens direction is firm, fresh and brutal.
