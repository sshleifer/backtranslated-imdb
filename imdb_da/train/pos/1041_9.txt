Watch on the Rhine started as a Broadway game by Lillian Hellman, who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still tied to Nazi Germany by the infamous non-aggression pact signed in August 1939. So much for The fact that Hellman just echoed the Communist Party Line changed the line a few months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work. The game Watch on the Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as family matrimony and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> In 1943, Lukas won a prize quote and won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had existed, he would have won it too. Oscar is even more remarkable when considering who he was against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For whom Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger cashier name than he was. Luke's nomination is usually the kind that the academy gives out of a field. Jack Warner knew why Mady Christians did not repeat their Broadway part, and Luke's wife got the role of Bette Davis. Davis did not take part because it was a particularly prominent role for her, but because she believed in the picture and would just be associated with it. It is the same reason that she made The Man Who Went to Dinner a much easier game than this one. Davis is the daughter of a late US Supreme Court Justice who married a German citizen back in Weimar days. Since many years are vagabond on Europe's continent, Davis Lukas and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European war. They are welcomed by Lucile Watson, who is thrilled to finally meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The flight in this ointment is some other housekeepers, a friend of Davis's outdated days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband, who are also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrate George Coulouris. Coulouris is a waste and a consumption and he smells of a double trade opportunity when he suspects Luke's anti-fascist background. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are quite correct, that is why the family has been the vagabond they have become. Luke fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyal to him, whatever he does. These decisions affect all the other members of the cast. <br/> <br /> Adding a bit more to the Broadway game, including some lovely Fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German Embassy were a Hammett creation with so noisy types such as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable signs ever to display as the no account runmanian counter. He was a metaphor for his own country that embraced the Nazis with gusto and then despised them without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was up for the best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in for whom the mountain taxis. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best adapted manuscript and the film itself lost to Best Picture for the second anti-fascist classic Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is a topic firmly planted in these specific times, Watch On the Rhine still packs a strong anti-fascist message that repeats itself indefinitely.
