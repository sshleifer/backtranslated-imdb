Wow! I loved this movie and love Judy Marte !! This girl is not just an amazingly beautiful face, she is fun and really really talented !! She made me laugh many times just by being very naturally hard with Victor, who desperately struck her! We will see her a lot in the coming years ... and probably also from director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I saw for a long time! Very refreshing! It is true, cozy, fun, well filmed, it has it all: good story, good actors, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow pace, real life, city movie that maybe Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! It is better!
