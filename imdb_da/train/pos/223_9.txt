in one of Neil Simon's best games. Creaky, cranky ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns along with a television comedy are special. The problem is that they haven't even seen each other for over a decade. Full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a steady stream of humor. Good work also by Richard Benjamin as the head nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as nurse and Howard Hesseman as television commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia note: Opening montage includes recordings from the Hollywood Revue of 1929 showing Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the singing Brox Sisters.
