I really thought this movie was great. Not only is the story correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's account of Victoria and how she kept her spirit, even though she was forced into a virtual exile in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the film are so genuine and tender that at the end of the film you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in the grief of Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the movie are worth noting as well. I appreciated the beautiful score that moves me quite wonderfully with the dramatic movement of history. I also considered that the cinematography was excellent, some scenes left me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they portray. <br /> <br /> There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this movie, and it rates as one of 2009's best!
