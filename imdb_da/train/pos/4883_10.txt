We as a family were so happy with "The Blonde Bombshells Last" we bought a copy for our home library. <br /> <br /> The play is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. The music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. To outline the story here would ruin the 'plot, as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Full character for this most enjoyable and uplifting production, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a belly day and lots of music.
