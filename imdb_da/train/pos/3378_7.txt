This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well I actually saw both The Simpsons and Futurama, and it gets a mention in both, so I figured "what bad". The film brings home a few "what if there" that makes you realize how lucky we are in this day and age, where we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interestingly, in the year 2022 men still have a single knife safety razor! Nice that those responsible don't overload the movie with unnecessary special effects, ray guns etc. Some great "furniture" when you count on what that means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
