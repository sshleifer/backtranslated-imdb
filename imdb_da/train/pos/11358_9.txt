The bad DVD video quality is the only reason I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. It could have been so much better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie covering several themes at once. If you don't like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this movie is still a must-see. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to "Silence of the Lamb" for several reasons. The way in which the serial killer is portrayed has been made much better in Citizen X. You see more details about his privacy because you "travel" with the killer who gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this was "Henry - Portrait of a serial killer". If you were fascinated by that movie, you should definitely take a look at Citizen X.
