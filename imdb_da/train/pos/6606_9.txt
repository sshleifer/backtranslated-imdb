Time for Hollywood to sit up and notice! If the actors act snooty, all you need to do is get the animators working on this little wonder. The Renaissance is probably the first animation file to make you forget you don't see people. Although voice overs of the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best I've ever heard, but even then, the emotions depicted by the 'comics' are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not entirely new, but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting. Ironically, such a technical wizard makes you forget that this is actually a very nice movie. Pacing and plot development are wonderful and the dialogues sharp. Plot: Offended by a mega-corporation's top employee unravels a tale of deception and corruption with a cold heart at the helm. Can't say much without giving it all away ... except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must see .. even for 'adults' who smear at 'comics'
