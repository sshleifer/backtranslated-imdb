What was there around 1939 that helped produce so many outstanding Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it was, the magic can also be found in this Columbia image. It's a long forgotten screw basketball comedy that Turner Classic Movies has started to show. (Maltin's film book doesn't.) In almost all departments, Amazing Mr. Williams a jewel. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a first-rate police officer who can never find time to marry his intent. As the wedding bells are ringing, he is called to a murder scene. That lady must learn the hard way not only to enjoy the practice of criminals but to belong to the police force. There is much laugh in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas again showed that he had few comrades in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the top of her career and is a pleasure. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are fun. <br /> <br /> The movie goes a little too long, but who cares? The Screwball comedies are always capable of entertaining, and this movie is right there with the best.
