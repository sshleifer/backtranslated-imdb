I really like this show. Therefore, I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez is racist and that he fired Masiela Lusha out of the show simply because he discovered she was not a Latino emigrant but was an alien from Albania. I learned this from people on the show. She was really one of the better parts of the show and thus learning that even among those you think would be sensitive to racism, they can also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born is it really disappointing.
