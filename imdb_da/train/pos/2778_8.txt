I saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! Bending it as Beckham is a pretty typical coming-of-age movie about a pretty atypical girl. This is Parminder Nagra's ("ER") breakout role, plays Jess, a teenager in England who is trapped between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (it's football for us North Americans). And although she is actually much older than her character, she plays the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), his teammates who also go through family problems, especially with his mother wearing purple nail polish and small bows on her shoes and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is afraid to play sports means the daughter is lesbian. Jules and Jess both love to play the game and have trouble trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. Unfortunately, they both love the same man - Joe, their trainer (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle gives a certain strain in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, scenes for a long time, and this movie could probably have benefited from the overall tighter editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly fun movie about growing up, cultural struggle and love of football. It's about women's empowerment, chasing your dreams and supporting your friends. Fun, Charming and Fun, Bend it Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8.10.
