I really enjoyed it here - I'm a big fan of movies that breaks your mind and gives you many questions and ideas for debate, and this was a great example. But then Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, should we?). I especially loved the way it handled the travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way events in the past and the future merged and fed into each other. <br /> <br /> It was also really well done aesthetically - the art direction was really good, and I wish I could see it on the big screen. The scenes of the future had a similar feel to Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often truly visually convincing. <br /> <br /> But the most striking thing about it was that it was two actors, I usually don't like much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both provided great performances here. Pitt special - I had seen one or two movies before it made me realize that he could actually act (as opposed to what I had originally thought), but this really extinct them. I actually found myself asking my friends at some point "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable achievement of his career (though it may not say too much).
