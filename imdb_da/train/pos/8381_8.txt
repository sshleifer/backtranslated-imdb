This movie I've loved since I was young! Its excellent. Although it may be a bit much for the average film guards if one cannot interpret certain subtleties in the movie (for example, our hero's name is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander, he shot in the heel with a rocket, like Achilles in mythology was shot in his heel). It's just a little fact that's a little fun! Anyway, great movie, great story, it would be nice to see it redone with today's special effects! Oddly, Gary Graham had an average success with the lead in the T.V. Alien Nation show. This movie is a fun watch and should be appreciated more!
