What would you expect from a movie titled 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as 'festive fun', something like Ghandi or English patient? There are many things I love about this movie, it's fun, it's very well thrown out and it's wonderfully written. I came to the movie as a Kaplan / Elfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the movie doesn't come across like that because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, one minute a child-like adult, the next a mature man who realizes he's got everything in life except what he really wants. In fact, we see Latham grow up in this movie when he meets the problems with those he envies and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own party is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has fewer faint or faint scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other kind of drama, it works either, or it doesn't, and very few comedians get it right every time. I especially loved the drama scene, where the family goes to read parts written by Latham. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and Brian Valco's comments (Josh Zuckerman). It's the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing to the Christmas tree to earn prize money that keeps the film moving well together. <br /> <br /> The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) into the story brings a nice romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course, it is corny and contrived; He is rich and beautiful, she is beautiful and single, and inevitably her and Afflect end up falling in the snow and finding themselves face to face. Great! One thing I wanted to use was more use of festive music to enhance the atmosphere, but I can't really complain. I got what I wanted.
