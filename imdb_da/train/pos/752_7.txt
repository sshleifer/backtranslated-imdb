Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles come in all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, older lovers. Jodie Foster, kind of packing dog, tries to keep everyone together as "a family" (as the family unit she has never had) and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly everyone grows up and goes away. The exact plot point, although signed throughout, is unfortunately manipulated with. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio, who rages a car full of bullies on his skateboard? Or an even longer order - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about "pain of illusion". Part of the dialogue is actually blurry, and I don't care much for an editing late in the movie that tells clumsy from a death to a wedding. But it is nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story of the loss of a tight bond. And Jody's face at the end speaks volumes. If the viewers are choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. It does not pan for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hope we understand. *** from ****
