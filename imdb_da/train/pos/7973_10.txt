Maybe I'm a sap, but it's the cutest movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out. Between then and now (embarrassed by 15 years) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't worry, they're happiness tears! And that's not all juice! There is also a lot of humor and comedy in it. Normally, the whole talking animal can be a big move, but in this movie it is not. My only advice: Even though you love this- don't look sequal ... cornyness! I suggest everyone check this out ... you won't be sorry about how old or young you are!
