I have never seen four hours to go as fast as I saw this movie. This movie restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always supposed to have. Even the oh-so famous talks are done in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh's brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the film. Making it a complete and complete version fills so many gaps and allows for a new understanding of the tragedy despite its length. Where to expect the dark, gloomy clich√© castle, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.
