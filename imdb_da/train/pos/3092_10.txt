You probably already know all of this already, but 5 other episodes that have never been broadcast can be seen at ABC.com. I have seen many televisions over the years and it may be my favorite program ever. It is a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Omg, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and so natural in these roles. Even the kids are good. Wonderful show. So sad it is gone. Of course, I wonder about the reasons why it was canceled. There is no way I want to believe that Mrs Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. It was in the perfect time in this market. I've seen all the episodes again at ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
