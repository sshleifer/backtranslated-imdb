Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas in the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Big threw around, but really enjoyed Campbell Scott's work (the come-back photographer) and Hope Davis (recent widow of journalist killed in Iraq). Aside from the play, the writing was fresh and the actress excellent. The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not the Warner Bros. or another studio backlot that added a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality waste. Too bad it didn't last.
