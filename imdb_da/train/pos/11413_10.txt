I thought it was a great movie for children aged 6-12. A little sappy, but the story is uplifting a fresh one. It turns out that a young person's dreams can really come true. I think it's a good story for any child who is feeling down, or feels like trying to juggle many things among them. Very "cute" movie. Bravo.
