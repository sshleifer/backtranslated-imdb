This movie brings many memories of the old classic cinema where the actors should not take off their clothes to make the viewers watch their movies. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think the biggest plus in this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it is certainly the film's making. <br /> <br /> I've seen lots of comments about the movie being sick sweet and too slushy. In response to this, I think to some extent that this is a correct analysis, but considering this is a Barjatya movie, I believe that it has been significantly toned over MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost unbearable to look at in some places. <br /> <br /> In this movie, when the sentimental moments come together, you find yourself smiling and want the budding couple all the best and hope that nothing bad happens to them. <br /> <br /> Another big plus is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have acted very well, especially Shahid, who looks good in the movie. Amrita simply looks amazing and should be taken seriously as a prominent great star. Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I feel it was too long. Some of the center could have been trimmed and it might get even more effect. I also think about the music, although it fits into the movie when you see the situations, is a bit old-fashioned and the movie could have been beneficial if a more up-to-date soundtrack was available. Although the imaging of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie, its romantic, looks amazing and has a dramatic climax (I won't go into details just if you haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> PS. If you're inclined to cry - take a tissue! (I needed more)
