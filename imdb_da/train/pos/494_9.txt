This is the start of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "down to earth" child of sensation with darker and less "plaggy" scenography. The people need a little more time to develop, but they have potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with the whole Star Trek series right) is that they show such a gloomy picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (The Earth has stopped war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, subordinate T'Pol, who is the volcano and communications officer Hoshi, who is human. Hoshi is pretty wimpy and T'Pol is made to be a "volcano babe". <br /> <br /> Some crew members feel a bit too American (as opposed to the TNG crew more international feelings) but create interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot, however, for a very good series.
