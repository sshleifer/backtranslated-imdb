Ultra-ugly crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonal reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", even though it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it is an engaging, erroneous bit of chaos about a Cambodian lone, Pang (Edison Chen) arriving in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While flying from the scene, he kills the colleague of cop Sam Wai, who is in the midst of dealing with his dying father in harmony, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang, resulting in nearly a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately, because I have never seen so many people beat the pool out of each other as I have lately. These are grim, unpleasant things, and so I am so in part, and I welcome his downbeat vibe. It is visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything flushes downwards until each character finds himself in a world of screaming pain. A partial plot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and provides a surprising fourth action that boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery.
