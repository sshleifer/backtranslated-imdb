I hate over long over-talky French movies, but my favorite movie is always the longest and most numerous French movie of them all. I saw it twice in the mid 70's and then it disappeared. But I finally came to see it again in 1999 and fell in love again. The most notable is that it feels as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
