There is not much going on in this story - only two men use very different ways of dealing with memories of Vietnam. But what it lacks in terms of terms, it is more than in action and realism. It is a silent film about the bond of friendship and common experience. We even get romance (not gratuitous - just another real piece of this story). It's worth seeing.
