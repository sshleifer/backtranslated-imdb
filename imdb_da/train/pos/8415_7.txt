If the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist cinema), this pre-WWI movie is grandfather. The titular student starving in an empty garnet makes an appointment with the devil - the devil gives him a bottomless bag of gold in exchange for "everything in this room". The devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror. He goes out with the student's doppelganger who commits crimes that the student is guilty of. the plot is crying for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is almost all shot in shady daylight. But the scene, where the reflection goes out of the mirror, still packs a wallop. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends it tells than for its own sake, the Student of Prague is still worth it.
