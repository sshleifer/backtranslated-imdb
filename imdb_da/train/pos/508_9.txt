In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klingon Klaang with his plasma gun after the explosion of a methane store in his yard, and Klingon is sent to Starfleet Hospital. The Vulcan Ambassador Soval proposes to discontinue the life support system and bring Klang's corpse to his war-war in the plane of Kronos with honor. Captain Jonathan Archer, however, suggests joining Enterprise in his first journey and bringing Klaang back to his home plane. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Dr. Phlox, who deals with Klaang, to complete his crew member, and the Vulcan sub-commander T'Pol is assigned to participate in the Dangerous Enterprise first mission. When the star vehicle's equipment is shut down, Klaang is kidnapped by Sulibans after a shooting at the hospital. After the autopsy of Suliban, which was killed in the shooting, Captain Archer was informed by Dr. Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant changed in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol changes the company's sensors to track the Suliban spacecraft until she reaches the planet Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a courier, bringing an important message on the temporary cold war from Suliban Sarin to the leaders of Klingons in Kronos . <br /> <br /> Despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I haven't followed the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable TV. I decided to buy the DVD box in the first season, and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first company, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are excellent, at least in this pilot. I noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, so my review is valid for both. I didn't like the music stamp that I found very annoying, but it was an exception to this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
