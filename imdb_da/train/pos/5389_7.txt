As a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal department (and one too hard case), this fast programmer has a satisfying emotional effect - mainly because Eric Linden as the confused young man in the main plot is so tangible one wreck and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence to give a lieutenant likely to have it sent to him; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to disinfect the audience's sympathy, and she is a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationship with the other girls in the department make up the heart of the movie, and the result - not a completely happy one - feels right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the cinema's few perfect actresses", in the words of film historian David Thomson's good words exudes warmth and authority as the main nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a non-willing new mother of twins, comes to croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunk lullaby. Frank McHugh appears in another subplot and he gets to show more range than Warners normally allowed him. It scaled and paced the message, and Lind's expected father panic stays with you for days - this kind of part was often laughed at, but he is a frightened young child in trouble and very convincing.
