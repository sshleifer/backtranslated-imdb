**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see <br /> <br /> *** = A solid, dignified, very entertaining piece <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable error <br /> <br /> ** = Can still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious problems or is detained by inevitable elements considered inevitable (eg, genre) <br /> < br /> * 1/2 = Mostly a pile of nothing triggered by mildly worthy moments BOMB = Not of visible quality <br /> <br /> - California = *** <br /> <br /> - Not Classified (For Highly Violent Material, Significant Sexuality and Language) <br /> <br /> I rented this movie and expect an in-your-face summer-Blockbuster quality celebration of Brad Pitt's face, but was happily surprised and disappointed . This is really more of a drama and very bleak in it ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays out his possibly u-sexiest movie ever with exciting talent. Who started out as a hopeless but harmless "white waste" man was realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messy mind. In some of the last stages of the film I found it hard to keep an eye on him - he was unpredictable and scary. This proves to be very good to write and act. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that have made me hold my breath no less than once, and I don't mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly designed I actually win and gasp on what I saw. It was like seeing a rhinoceros and a lion sitting in a cage and watching as they gnaw each other to death. Again I am very impressed with the screenwriter (s); The one they are doing made the impossible: mixed oil and water. I also enjoyed Juliette Lewis' performance. It is so rare for this talented young actor to designate these days that when she does, it is such a joy. Some of her moments in this movie brought me to tears. I mean it. The feelings that this girl can awaken in your head are incredible, and I remember clearly being obscure at a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I almost feel that I cheat the high-tech craft, the filmmakers have shown by giving only "CALIFORNIA" a *** rating. But the dark feelings that it touches are too powerful and depressing to raise it. I think everyone should watch this movie themselves. I really do.
