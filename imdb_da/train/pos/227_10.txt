Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this movie, you might think Duvall's appearance is reincarnation when it's best. One of my most favorite movies. I want the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful nature and music and "too true to life", especially for those of us who live in or moved to the south. This is a "real time in time." Life moves slowly, but "we do not remain strangers."
