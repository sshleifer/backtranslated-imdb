Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the kind of person people would almost never know by name. However, he once again plays the actor - one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films who played his role more than once. I have already seen him two times and loved him every time because he was so funny and fresh. This movie is also great to watch, besides the Girardot, there are many other amazing actors together for the trip - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive cast, and they have probably made the job easier for leading husband and wife Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the major reasons I love these old B movies. Though the mystery itself is rarely fantastic, the movies are really satisfying because of the soft writing and acting. As for this movie, Vance is played wonderfully by Lowe, but as I said, the mystery itself is a reflection - with a stupid plot of hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like that. I have been training in clinical hypnosis, and if I could do something that the evil guy could do in the movie, I would have done it! Used car dealers and a couple of my old bosses would have been obvious goals !! <br /> <br /> All in all, while it wasn't the best Philo Vance movie, it was very good and it was a shame that Lowe only played this role once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was obstructed by a long, long list of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) who played Vance. This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series - too many different players playing the leading man. <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing and exciting - but also impossible.
