This movie never got the attention it deserved, even though this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting, and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on the screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well played by Eric Stoltz. Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital in a department with other men who have spinal cord injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his poisonous lover, played by Helen Hunt, showing early signs of her later academic award-winning work. <br /> <br /> Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a huge job like the angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist blast. I think Forsythes two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry with square dancers, and later, when he feels empathy for a young Korean man shot in a wine shop, stops. My favorite scene with Snipes is in the round table on sexual opportunities after sexual injury. The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate but not free sex scenes. The orgasm in the department is both sexy and fun. There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped item for the strip. It is really a comedy of error, as they make their weak attempts to get the habit of seeing the "naked ladies." The story is made even more exciting by the fact that director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This movie is genuine, not shiny or flashy. Having the amount of talent in a movie of such a small budget is fantastic. I recommend this movie to anyone I see because it is one of those movies that even improves on a different look. It's a shame that such a great job is overlooked, but through video it may get the attention it really deserves.
