Let's go straight to the point: This is the movie I would take with me on a desert island (with DVD player). It's just perfect. If a reason to watch a movie is that you love the actors, you like to watch them free to engage in space and emotions. This movie is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) comes on stage, and Maurice (Cassavetes) will improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the special flow that gives you an impression camera, follows the actors as if it were led by the theatrical principle of "private space". . amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of narrative and realistic drama. Cassavetes argues again with Hollywood and Majors politics, but this time he does it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting movies about theater. Well, this movie is a bliss.
