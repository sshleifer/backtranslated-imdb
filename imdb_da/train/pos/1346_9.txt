As a "rebuttle" of the kind to AFI's top 100 films, the British Film Institute produced a documentary film with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a big movie fan and trust to have seen many, many movies. But I am nuhered in comparison with my idol. In this fantastic (but long) documentary, Scorsese goes through several stages of American history on film. This is divided into several sections, including Western, Gangster, and Noir. Full of bouncing enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a fantastic tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.
