I was also in the movie, but I don't know if they actually put this scene in. On our way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a gas station while they made the film, and we were asked (all of us) to run in and shout to go! Free bird! We were about 10 years old, could anyone who has seen the movie tell me if that part was actually held in the movie, it would be good to know! I remember thinking that the movie had never come out because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I guess it's been a successful movie I can buy it, but first I want to know if I'm in it! : D thanks
