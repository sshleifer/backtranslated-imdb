This is an exciting exciting masterpiece from Brian De Palma with amazing performances all around! It's extremely exciting, and often scary, and the score is amazing, plus all the characters were awesome. Yes it relieves Psycho a lot, but it is still an excellent scare / thriller, with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale! This is undoubtedly one of the best horror / thrillers I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever, plus Michael Caine is simply amazing in this! The finish is excellent and the hospital scene near the end is scary, plus the end twist shocked hell out of me! Never managed to crawl out, and the stem sequences are absolutely brilliant, plus Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had amazing chemistry together! This is an exciting exciting masterpiece from Brian De Palma, with amazing performances all around! The direction is incredible!. Brian De Palma does a great job here with Amazing camera work, incredible angles, great use of colors, great zoom in and zoom out are great POV shots and keep the movie at a very very fast pace! There's a little blood. We get bloody stabbings, knifing's, bloody guns and 2 bloody slits in the neck. The action is amazing! Michael Caine is amazing here, he is amazing in the acting department, creepy, very sympathetic, was mysterious, and really just did a great job in general I loved him! (Caine Rules!). Angie Dickinson gives a memorable performance here and was pretty beautiful and had good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! And is amazing here, she is extremely sympathetic as the hooker, had excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon, and put on a great show! Keith Gordon is very good as the child, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and was very sympathetic!. Dennis Franz is good as a detective. All in all, this is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made, and I say, whatever you do right away and see it! ***** out of 5
