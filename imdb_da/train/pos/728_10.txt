Ramones, whom I consider as the founders of modern punk rock, is launching their unique sounds to a stunningly twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan (PJ Soles) facing a ruthless, joyless principal (Mary Woronov) for the right to rock. <br /> <br /> With a soundtrack of great music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and performance. It has come across riotous sight gags (like mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my all-time favorite movie opening) and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a fine, dignified, dramatic epic, you may have to look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
