This movie was disaster at Box Office, and the reason behind it is the innocence of the movie, the sweetness of the story. Music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive, and he shines again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. Soha looks so cute in the movie. The rest star was simply okay. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Don't miss this movie, it's a wonderful movie and a good one for us. Abhay's best work to date. I want to give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
