Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is certainly one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scary. I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before I saw this, it was just how it worked. But I have to say that this one blows all the others away. It's really scary, and when Michael looks from behind a bush or walks around in the dark he sends a chill down on his back. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael sticks a guy and leans his head to one side. It is one of the noblest images in film history. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, such as Friday the 13th movie, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you can imagine a crazy guy like he is walking around and killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after seeing it for a couple of nights. What is great about this movie is that it does not trust gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It's too bad that the later movies in the series weakened from this because it's so good for an example of a spectacular slasher film as they come.
