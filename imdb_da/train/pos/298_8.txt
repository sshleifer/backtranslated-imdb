New York has never looked so good! And there is no one in this movie either. While the script is a bit light, you may not like this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost want people like this really existed. The actors' appeal is what really puts it over (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) Continue and rent or buy this movie, you'll be glad you did.
