This movie, starting with an interesting opening of two hot blondes, getting it on the back of a wheelchair-specific vehicle, has right the shabby little personality to start. The support of seven (although a girl does not hang around for the body part, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already as small as it is) is all super-fast, as our story is about teenagers sticking out in the desert (a strange but effective choice by option), which is chased by a grim man in black gloves and jeans running a black truck. It predicts many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The murderer himself is pretty scary, and we find comfort in the extremely sympathetic heroine of Jennifer McAllister (look at the exciting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all blacks, while our benevolent heroine sports all white clothes, as sharp and stonewashed as it may be) ). Director Bill Crain does some really good things with his camera, some nice tricks on the screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. There are probably few in the low bodycount to please make fans, and probably T & A from a few girls to please T&A fans. Overall, this flick is highly underestimated and widely used in the slasher film world, as it has been rare to find video. Highly recommended.
