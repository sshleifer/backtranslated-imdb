I grew up in the time when the music in this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to USO and night clubs. Guess it sounds like I'm living in the past (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with that? !!? The Second World War was a horrible time, except where music was concerned. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I don't know how I ever missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the modern generation of an alternative to Rap and New Age music that is offensive to me. Please see this movie and give it a try!
