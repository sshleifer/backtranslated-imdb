Another comment about this movie made it sound miserable. Considering that talking pictures were so new - I think the manuscript and the action were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Still, it is great to see her in this way - still learning the craft. So many clich√©s came from this movie, and it seems this movie blew some tracks over the next 70 years. My voice is watching it and remembering how young this type of movie was. Hold and open mind, and you may be shocked at how troubled the characters were in this image, to be 1934, and how we see the early part of the last century as busy. I love it and hope that you make your own mind about it not influenced by other negative and a note comments.
