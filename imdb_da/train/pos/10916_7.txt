The comics between William Powell and Jean Arthur are the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. Powell is probably the most suave detective in the thirties, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a series of small tinkly watches. They are extremely funny to see, so take the wave of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. Eric Blore also has some comics like Powell's butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's MGM contract included a clause allowing him to refuse to be loaned to another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked script so he eagerly accepted the task . They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
