I saw this on the big screen and was enclosed with it. Queen Victoria's younger year is a mystery, and it is a perfect description of how a young girl was drawn into one of the world's highest roles. The scripture is perfect, the play is amazing, the history and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Fun how her mother is played by Elizabeth the 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This depiction of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been on the Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been around then: "My mother and her boyfriend tries to steal my life ". <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of much of British and Commonwealth history.
