I see what my ancestors saw in the youthful Bette Davis. She is splendid during this almost forthcoming political comedy, which is actually Warren Williams as the political operative constantly behind his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex, and I found myself rooting for her all the way. Williams' character is not at all sympathetic, and he is not even a decent one. Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate withdrew from his sleep at a political convention and appointed as governor to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, this whole mess is broken by the interncine political warfare in a party called "Progressive Party." If you have a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one you are affiliated with, reflected in Williams' and Kibbee's fictional "Progressive Party". I could draw exact parallels, but we're not here for it. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever seen any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, as Williams' right arm, looks and behaves much like Bert Wheeler. He had fooled me. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
