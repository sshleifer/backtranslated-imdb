When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands uncertain on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and about to step down to his death, it reminded me of an almost identical scene in another movie made nine years later, "The Woman in Green "where Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is also throwing himself into the room while being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempts to murder conscientious criminals. Exciting cinematic excitement in both of these scenes. When will they learn that you cannot shoot the minds of great fictional detectives?
