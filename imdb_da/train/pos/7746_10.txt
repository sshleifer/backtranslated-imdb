Those of you who know the dEUS group know chiefly Tom Barman. He instructed this movie a bit as if he was creating music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, but mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have at least a good life, and it has no goal. The movie starts on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes by several people, some of them have nothing in common, but they come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: A teacher writing books, no reader, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men constantly in touch with the law, a man working in a cinema and two young women. Throughout the film there is a man who has something to do with the wind. All characters have their problems with their family or friends or just with life. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and harbor. Today's events are not easily explained, I recommend just watching the movie, which is simply too much to tell. But I can say this, the barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set the mood, especially the party is full of great music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience on itself, it will not leave you any wiser about life, perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it or have false moral truths. In short, see it, it's definitely worth it!
