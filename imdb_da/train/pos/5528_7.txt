This is a very beautiful and almost meditative movie - there is hardly any dialogue in it, except for the story; and the stage and music compliment each other perfectly. I did not first forbid the girl's and the fox's red hair before it was pointed out by me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost an old-fashioned type of children's movie and says that children today prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc. - But I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature that this movie certainly does. Maybe not the best movie of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages - not just kids.
