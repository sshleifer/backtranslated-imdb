Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, a small time hood from Cuba transformed into a rich and strong criminal gentleman in Miami, and he does so with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and his words, and he does not break 'em for no one . Starts as a job for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly climbs the ladder of the organization along with his long-time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he tries to murder Tony, but unsuccessfully. Tony is sorry, and nothing can stop him now. The movie has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumping gangster, another well-known face is Harris Yulin as a busy politician trying to shake Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tons Young's sister. Credits to the Ecxellent manuscript by Oliver Stone. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see that this guy is very talented. The movie has a great look at it. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: one at the fancy restaurant ("Good night for the bad guy"). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he is still kicking ass and killing about 20 assassins who invaded his house. This is certainly one of the most impressive conclusions on a movie I've ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and detective film it is a must-see. For the rest of you it is highly recommended. 10.10
