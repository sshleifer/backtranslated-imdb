I just watched this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who was working on it, so I thought I'd check it out. I thought it was a really beautiful movie and can't wait to look at it again. the actors were really good and i loved all the music! There was not much to talk about in the movie, which first felt a little strange - but when I got into it, I thought the story and the play were really emotional and meaningful and thought it left much to the imagination. I would like to see the movie again because there was so much in it that I forgot many little things, but know that I left the theater and thought about the movie. It was shot beautifully and it was all really unique.
