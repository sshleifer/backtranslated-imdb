This long episode wraps the amount of astonishing surprises, thriller, mystery, and worries about a battle of wits of Sherlock against Charles Augustus Milverton, a champion blackmailer. This is an outstanding long life for the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film, the usual Holmes canon appears as Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, although no Moriarty is the greatest villain, Charles Augustus. It's a real rip yarn with intrigue, excitement and excitement, including an exciting last twist. This is a specific Sherlock movie, but we find that Holmes falls in love with a servant, kiss, cry and even robber. This time along with the episode ¨Scandal in Boheme¨ with Irene Adler, the result is the only one that Holmes is enamored. Top-notch Brett performance, along with Peter Cushing is the best Sherlock TV, while the cinema is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett performs as a resolute, haughty, impetuous relationship. Here, Dr. Watson is not a cartoon, botcher and lumpy girl personified by Nigel Bruce, but is a sparse and clever partner well-incarnated by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint for Brett. Casting is frankly magnificent, special mention to Robert Hardy as astute nasty. Hardy, today famous for the role of Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several successes like the 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill. In addition, secondary actors with fantastic performances are shown. Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon. The film has a colorful atmosphere, London's streets and 221 Baker Street houses are well designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It is a must see for Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
