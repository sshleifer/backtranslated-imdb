This movie is a real gem. The hoop of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives are completely credible. The dialogue is fresh and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and not at all clich√© or hackneyed. Until climax, that is. Then it is as if the film went a bit off the rails, and it was a bit hokey and incredible. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 of it is really remarkable. I gave it a 8. There are some notable performances here. Check out this movie.
