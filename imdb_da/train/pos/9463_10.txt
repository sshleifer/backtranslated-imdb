I loved "Dan in Real Life". A wonderful travel-to-love story as if you've got mail or while sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and raw jokes, and not so romantic it makes you throw away. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular counselor who can't seem to get things out of his own life. Until one day, he and together with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche) meet a glorious test of a woman who seems to be framed in a stupid filter that sticks back to the stellar classic cinema. Chemistry takes place over a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be out for a previous engagement and they must share roads. <br /> <br /> Later, we are treated to Dan's tight, fun-loving relatives who not only have great breakfasts together, but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweet Dan as many many bachelor jokes. What I liked a lot was that even though the family's properties could be seen as unpleasant to some, I thought it was a great depiction of a large family who did not wake up in parody or crude exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are really interested in the best thing about Dan. There are wonderfully unpleasant family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is curious, but never mean-spirited or gossip; quirky, but never outlandish. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's boyfriend, he is brought to the family gathering. And so begins a roller coaster of restrained longing and fun love popping. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just thought this movie was simply amazing. It is not very "hip" or "smart", never too fair and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit, so many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a good balance between storytelling pictures and fun-but-genuine dialogue. In fact, early in the movie, the first spark of love begins with moody discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation, where the characters say what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> But I have probably rambled and repeated myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great date movie, trust me, you will laugh, and only if you are a geek like me, you will be a little haunting. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 4 stars Degree: A
