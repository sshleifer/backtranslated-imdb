Greetings again from the dark. Highly anticipated, twisted comedy by author / director Richard Shepard is an excursion for the Pierce Brosnan actor. The Bond guy is gone. This new guy is something completely different !! Have read that Shepard believed that Brosnan was too much the beautiful boy for this plum roll, but Brosnan turns out to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and is anything but beautiful! Avoid underestimating where twisted humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags on all kinds of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might consider politically wrong. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his amazing facial movements and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to see. Greg Kinnear is the straight guy for Brosnans cartoon and has lots of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective entertainment role as Kinnear's wife (what is her name "Bean"?), There is a little excitement when she has an organizer in her living room. <br /> <br /> visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is certainly not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a little away from the center and you enjoy the risky film production, it may be for you.
