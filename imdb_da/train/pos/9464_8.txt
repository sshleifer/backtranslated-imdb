The widowed man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life", which advises families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the elder, just got her license but Dan doesn't allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) is in love with her high school friend Marty; and the young lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan who gives her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parents' home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of her wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook) who is also in love with her. During the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and a great movie with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the beautiful Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is amazing and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are amazing and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story. The manuscript is wonderful, and the performance of the talented actors and actresses is fantastic, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of the Dan Pillar and plan to be surprised with the reunification of Burns' family. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, my brother and our boyfriend")
