I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are the French song and in the opening title when the spatial soldier shouts "SPOON!" I jump up every time. I would recommend this movie to fans of Knox Klaymation and people who enjoy Jason Steele's second movie. His style of animation is very original. It takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also fun and is certainly not something you wanted to hear before. Like Max, the deformed spatula has a sound and light system in the head that radiates colorful light and happy music when he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime where.
