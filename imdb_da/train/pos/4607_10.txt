My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 movie, "Police Story." In it, Chan plays a super corps in Hong Kong that breaks a notorious criminal and his gang and is then assigned to protect husband's boyfriend (Brigitte Lin) so she can beat state evidence. As the story goes on, gangster sends his goons to send Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while the girlfriend Maggie Cheung is in check. As the "Drunken Master", "Police Story" has many of the chronicles and over-the-top martial arts / action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a fight royal in a crowded shopping mall. In her role as an instructor, Chan excels in excellence, giving a charismatic and fun performance that highlights the action. While the light on the overall slapstick humor of the "Drunken Master" in the heart "Police Story" is just a police force, a gritty cop-thriller that will be copied often in the coming years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
