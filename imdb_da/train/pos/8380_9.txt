Now I have always been a fan of Full Moon's puppet work. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story seems wonderful, the atmosphere really works, and the actors do a first rate job. Gary Graham, who really makes his mark on television in shows like Alien Nation Series and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that he can be an action star that kicks ass and takes name. The stop motion effects could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they looked plastic at me instead of the metal they were supposed to take. But it's a minor complaint about everything that is Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 stars out of 10.
