I was about 11 years old, I found out I was living 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. The Uncle House is located at Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. they have added home since the movie was made. I don't know the house number, but you can go see it. I am now 21 and I enjoy watching this movie. the bar on spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build their school. I was driving at the house last week, the house still looks good. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where john crosses the railway languages, they have made 225 higher. When I hear about John Loesing his son, I start thinking when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.
