This is an "odysessy through time" via computer animation, supposedly working on over 300 artists. Made in the late 80s and released in 1990, this was exciting thing for the day. I thought it was good and very interesting in spots. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes made no sense, but forms evolved into other forms, but it was fun to see. It's about visuals, not really about any kind of story. There were some odd sequences where odd-looking human creatures would dance around with birds overheard. All it's computer animated that was new then. Even the term "computer animated" was not known. <br /> <br /> It is simply a chance to showcase this new technology in short pieces of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners really must have loved this. <br /> <br /> It's a nice, exciting 40 minutes of "eyelash" and "head candy." With today's CG effects, this may have lost influence, but I think you will still be entertained by this.
