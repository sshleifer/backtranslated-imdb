With partial reconstruction and partial direct admission, the directors performed a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'état against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the rich Venezuelan minority, political opposition, the church (a cynical grin cardinal) and the American government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls 'Overthrow' or 'so democracy American style'. In fact, this foreign-backed intervention was not only a coup d'état against President Chavez, but also against the democratic majority who chose him. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant documentary, strongly confirmed by the violent reactions to and against it on the Internet. As Saint Augustine said, "Men love the truth when it baths them in its light; they hate it when it turns out wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
