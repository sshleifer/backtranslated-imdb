~ ~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning at an early viewing session ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children ranging from 11 to 6, so I'm sure many parents can relate to having to see many many "children" movies. This was refreshing for me. I haven't read this particular book so I don't know if it was true for the book. But it certainly took the gross factor to a high level. This is the story of the "new" child in the city, and it just happens that there is a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to choose children ... Do we not all have this time or other. He has the little brother whom he can't stand and parents that he is embarrassed about. What I enjoyed most was seeing how each character was completely different from the others all stood out. The bully (why do they always make the sausage a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she's no bullies! .. lol) is a big bully who finds herself crying out of her own big brother. It took turns and turns and you fall in love with them all and really find yourself routing for all the characters! Even the parents, good relationship between father and son. Everything around comfortable, sweet, fun, gross etc ...... Take your kids !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
