I just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and feel that I have to jump in here. I understand he doesn't like the movie, but his reasons are not clear. My feeling of this movie is that it is not afraid to raise the loneliness's weaker paths, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people who portrayed have many reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each other. Only great plays could do this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. I was really interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given them of such strong beliefs. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era acts, but personal feelings from each other, she is amazing in this role. Robert DeNiro is great as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to fail him in a world that does not care about his abilities. This is the first thing I have seen DeNiro by using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a sign, and I like it. This movie was a great surprise when I first saw it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
