I think most people don't seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least it's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a drug abuse movie; rather, it is a film about the mindset of the genius brothers, drugs are side effects, somewhat marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the author wanted it, he certainly failed, as most people think, is one of the many drug-related movies. However, I think something else is the case. As in many films showing different cultures, the audience generally understands films that show their own culture, that is, something they have grown up with and are quite familiar with. This film is to show what these "genius" people are very often thinking about and what problems they face. The reason they work like this is because they are bored of their minds :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept these things as if they are launching space shuttles daily. They start a pretty hard job and excel in no time. They want me to go to work, did nothing, still did it twice as good as the boys around me when they were over their projects, what should I do now with my spare time. And what's even more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior, not because you are a psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on the one hand, it is a challenging job, which is also quite boring sometimes, and from another they begin to figure out people's behavior. It's a recipe for great boredom. And the stupid things are usually done to get out of this state. The guys who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not a logical thing, is actually right.
