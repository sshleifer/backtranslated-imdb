An example of how another World War II documentary should be made using first-hand accounts of the actual troops and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict and archived footage gathered from all the time. I caught this on a retrieval on the history channel in half a year back, without really knowing about World War II at that time, but it enveloped me, and now I consider myself another World War Buffer, looking and reading everything I can find out of it, but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary, definitely worth buying the boxed set of ............. <br /> <br /> This is simply the highest standard documentary.
