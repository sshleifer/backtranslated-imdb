Sure, the Titanic was a great movie the first time you see it, but you really should see it another time and your opinion of the movie will definitely change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think about it), it's just annoying, and you're just sitting there watching the movie tank, when is this the ship to sink ??? And even that is not that impressive when you see it several times. The action in this movie is not bad, but not great either. Was I happy that DiCaprio didn't win an oscar for that movie, I mean, who does he mean is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes 1 semi-valid movie and will not make a movie under $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there is almost no movie with him in it. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character of the movie. Kate Winslet's performance, on the other hand, was wonderful. I also think that the director is very talented to put together a film of such size. There is a lesson to learn about this movie: there are too many love stories as it is, filmmakers should not try to add a curved romance to every movie !!! Out of a possible 100%, I give this movie only 71%.
