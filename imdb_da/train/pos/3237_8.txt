After my experience with Finland for just over a week, I would say that this film shows the nature of Finnish society very precisely. Especially the phenomenon for a young couple with a baby who has serious problems is very familiar to me as I witnessed the same thing personally when I was in Finland. People's affairs and problems, fragility in the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the growing money problem are all very well set without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points in movies that are not necessarily easy to understand and bond to, but the common big picture is nonetheless rewarding. Not every short story is exciting or profound, but as mentioned above, the big picture fails to deliver the feeling of "reality" and capture the seer. I happen to think in a quiet moment: What happens in all these people's lives on the streets? Well, that's what happens. Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this movie could apply to life in many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is, and rather damn it. <br /> <br /> A comment on the actor: Being a Finnish fan cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but I found the play in this feature right next door to that perfect perfect. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good attempt on the entire crew. I'm watching for future releases by the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
