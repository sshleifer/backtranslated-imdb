This cartoon style movie is fun, has a nice pace and a fantastic futuristic style to it. Author Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie lots of lines to distinguish: "Send me a copy" after signing a contract and sticking a pen back into the lawyers; "What pain in the neck," after stringing is underlined with barbed wire "He had to divide," after cutting his body between his legs; And finally, as Killian strikes through a billboard carrying his own face, Arnie concludes: "Now that hit the spot." Funnily enough, some similarities carry total revocation, another sci-fi flick with the starring Schwarzenegger.
