I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This movie is so well made, the character is well depicted, the costumes are the place on the play is good and the songs are amazing, my favorite is the 'Review of the situation' song by Ron Moody, which gives a brilliant depiction of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60's, but my sisters were so in weeks at the end I had to put them off singing the bloody songs, it was like rule 'Who will buy my wonderful roses' so I already knew all the songs before I saw the movie. It was a timeless musical that you could not recover at all. It's not exactly the book, and I don't think it would have worked so well if it had been. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed when he wrote Oliver to portray the poverty in London, the orphanage, the workshops and about what the poor had to survive and the film depicts is very good. Another great reason to watch this movie is Bullseye's old type of English Bull Terrier, note his long thin legs, this was bred by the breed many years ago, they must have chased high and low to find an example like him. and he is exactly how an English bully would have seen in Victorian times. He has scars (there are probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the trench. A Victorian bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat box. He is a beautiful dog in any way and notes that he does not comply with Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy. Of course, he has his standards, and he doesn't think he did. great musical to see if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, try it, there is something for everyone in this movie.
