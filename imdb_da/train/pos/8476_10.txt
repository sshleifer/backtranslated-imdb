*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad had taped this movie for me when I was 3. By 5 years I had seen it over 400 times. I just looked and saw it. And I still do that today! It has a nasty story, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After many years of training, the lamb is made for a really really bad look. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can't kill the lamb, no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and cannot return to his former lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are .. Well okay, and the voice action is better than some things today. All in all, you just * have to watch this movie, it's a good masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
