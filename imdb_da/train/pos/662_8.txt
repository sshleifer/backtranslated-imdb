An axellent second installment that manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is just amazing. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common with the exception of white and wisdom. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just a lot of fun, very stupid and very fun. It's the very first Christmas episode about a woman plagued by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after killing his own husband. Like the first episode; karma. The most humorous scene is a tie between her husband's murder and her phone call, first faking her fears until it becomes real.
