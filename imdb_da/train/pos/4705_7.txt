Of course, all those who voted less than 5 are not fans of pure, heavy-in-kind humor. Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. This is not a bigger than life affair. This is campy, slapstick humor played by some of Hollywood's best (and very versatile) actors. Piscopo was as clear as the top dog wannabee, once. <br /> <br /> To see the funniest attempt not really to cussing ever filmed, see Dimitri doing his piece as Morone. <Br /> <br /> I gave it a 7.
