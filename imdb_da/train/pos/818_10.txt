The return of Jedi is certainly the most action-packed series, and is a fine conclusion in Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo jailed by Jabba Hut and Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an upward battle against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can pull it out. <br /> <br /> The Opening Sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabbas palace, a slave and foam chamber and a new home for Han Solo when Luke and the gang are preparing for their rescue and with Luke's Jedi powers have the sides. <br /> <br /> We are also witnessing a huge triple battle at the end. He, Leia and Chewy beat Endor, desperately to deactivate the Death Star shields. The Rebel fleet led by Lando, struggling with the imperial fleet while waiting for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An epic end to a classic saga, and it's just the pace of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
