Lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. It depends on the child. This is not a movie for a 2-6 year old; It is more aimed at the 8 years and older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved it. At that time, most animated movies were a little too childish for my taste. This movie deals with more serious problems and therefore has a slightly more emotional impact. In this movie, the characters can die and be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters risk their lives. The good guys are not always quite sweet and cozy (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
