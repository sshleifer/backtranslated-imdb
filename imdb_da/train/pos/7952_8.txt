This is one of my favorite family movies. Loved it when I was a kid, and it still goes with me now that I'm older. I still laugh at all the same old jokes and can even throw a tear once. I have never had much care for animals talking, or at least UN animated, but the one I want to stand up for. It's a beautiful old movie, but it will always stay somewhere in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other live animal films that I can think of at the moment that I could even compare to, or even as much as this one. Maybe I can give too much praise for this movie, but I don't think show. I really have the big message that "Home is where the heart is." Or at least it's the message I've got from it. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
