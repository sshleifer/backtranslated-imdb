The ship may have sunk, but the movie did not !!! Director James Cameron from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing image. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner Table' scene where Roses family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose sees a look at her face that every woman should have when meeting 'THE ONE' ... I hope I have that look when I am in the living room with my future husband. Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF', but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mother, and all her elite is sitting with employees who live on the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost commits suicide, but the Gilbert Grape star saves her. I really liked hanging over the boat. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long, but it's great !!! Good story, good power, good actors !!! Go see it twice if you want it worth it !!!
