I just want to say that this can be biased as I am a producer of the film. However, I will maintain some dignity. <br /> <br /> Star of the movie, Oscar Ovies, offers a great performance like Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain touch to his character, which really allows the audience to connect with him often by saying about him and with a sense of hard comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant beam of support, without the crumbling of himself. His friends also lend a hand to Jeff's life, often making choices for him instead of letting him use his free will ... as often as he neglects, there is anyway. <br /> <br /> The script is amazing and the conversations flow like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half as many Ben Affleck boo-hoo parties. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is a bit shoddy at some points and the sound could also use a boost, but the performances shine on the smaller details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and a unique composer. All in all, this was a treat. A rare gem, among many jewels.
