There was not a day in 2002 when I was not chased by a scarecrow, I felt that this movie handled a serious question well <br /> <br /> It left many memories as it was so realistic <br / > <br /> Even today, I have nightmares about corn on the cob and can't even go close to the canned things in fear of my life <br /> <br /> However, I must admit at some point in movies I had to to turn it off as it hit too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, you could see this movie being educated on how it felt for us victims <br /> <br /> This movie does not teach us to take life for granted or to row with corn, believe me, I've been there and I have the scars. Watch the movie, its amazing and educational
