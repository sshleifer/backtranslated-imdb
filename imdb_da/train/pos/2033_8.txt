In fact, the answer only captures a small portion of this excellent Imax movie that educates us on our delicate self. CG and special cameras - assisted by Imax - show incredibly the inner (and outer) works of an average human being, whether adult men and women, boys and girls or babies. Almost every human body part is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (with Marvin Gaye hit), the heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how an infant can be submerged underwater and also how the brain's impulses look. It's great how we work. <br /> <br /> The subject runs around in a terrible mass. But all the time we still learn a hell lot about our bodies, which we should be * required * to know.
