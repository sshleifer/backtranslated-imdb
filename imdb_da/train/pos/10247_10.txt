This movie is banned in virtually any foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) Who stand in this must have been really desperate for a job or we are just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three bullies tortures hell out of a helpless woman, they use all sorts of things to ultimately kill her, they burn her, kick her, turn around in a chair (over 200 times!), They use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It doesn't sound that bad at all, but it can make you go in distress). They throw gut (probably from an animal) with her while shes turn out and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget about the grand finale, the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you haven't heard about these movies, and you see one without knowing it's a simulated snus movie, you'll think it is! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people out and do some sick! As I said purely underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. If you do not recommend I read the series before you see! From the gore, shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the story and all those things it is a 1. An underground classic ... My last rating is an 8/10 <br /> <br />
