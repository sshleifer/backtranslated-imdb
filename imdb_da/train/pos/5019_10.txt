Hi <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I watched this movie: "For the first time" with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the song for the main love scene in Micheal's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy, this movie has not been programmed for many years, and I do not know how to find the song. Many thanks for who can help me! I love this movie! Is very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
