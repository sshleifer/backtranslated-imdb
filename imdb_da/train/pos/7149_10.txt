Holes is a wonderful movie to watch. It has good messages in, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. I strongly recommend it to anyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the film gives the book a run for its money. Khleo Thomas also plays Zero. It really adds to that !!!! Laugh out loud !!!
