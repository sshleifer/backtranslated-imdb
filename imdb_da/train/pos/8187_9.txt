Someone finds it interesting that Ood looks oddly like 'Great Cthulhu' by H P Lovecraft vintage? hmmm? <br /> <br /> Large pairs of episodes (not referring to Billie Piper as most people seem to do!) in the impossible planet and Satan Pit. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels after the exorcist era ... great excitement episodes utilize fear and belief elements. The new team for these "who works well in magic for television." This certainly creates new fears and "hides behind the sofa" feelings not seen for many years in this continuation of a fantastic BBC series (sorry it is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper ends - perhaps not permanently - after the end of Series 2): O (((
