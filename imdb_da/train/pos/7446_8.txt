I cannot agree with any of the comments. The first time I watched the film on a British television channel, it was presented as an indie movie, and if you take the film at this angle, I think it's a completely different matter. I couldn't believe what I saw and was connected right away. The reason can be as bad as a JS show (ie there is no plot), but the play is evil, it's fun and it's all an incredible garbage game. <br /> <br /> It says so much about America than a Bully or a Ken Park without a drama perspective, but it gives a glimpse of American society, and more precisely which afternoon television viewers in America (and I think there are lots of them!) are interested in. It's all the neighbors we are talking about, aren't we? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
