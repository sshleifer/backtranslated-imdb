The events of September 11, 2001 do not need an extra human interest in following the fire adventure training or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave this. I think the directors were trying too hard, maybe they felt that today's events needed a story as a background. Comment from one of a policeman - "this is not a Disneyworld" is suitable. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is the convincing view of the depiction of the events. The filmmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other recording from the day matches what they shot.
