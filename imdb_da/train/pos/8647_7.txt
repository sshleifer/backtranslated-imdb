If this were to be a depiction of the US serial killer, it would come across as a definite average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels across the country to California to document America's most famous killers, unaware that one of his white trailer trash travel companions [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. <br /> <br /> It's more predictable throughout, this has its moments of action, and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I wouldn't bother to see it again.
