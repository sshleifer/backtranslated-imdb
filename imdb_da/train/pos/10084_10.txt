This spectacular movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I think it shows the 1930's China in the most real light ever seen in a movie. It's so heartbreaking in so many situations where you see how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly happy. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this movie. The actors are all perfect, so you feel like you've really come into another world. <br /> <br /> I simply can't recommend this movie highly enough. It can only change you forever after you have seen it.
