If you are under 13 or over 13 and pretty drunk, you will enjoy the D war. If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action movies, you will enjoy D-war. Otherwise don't bother! I watched the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the movie was over, all the kids (my nephews and their friends) couldn't stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Action and control are horrible. Storyline is extremely simple. But since half the audience were kids they screamed and shouted and cheered every time the dragons appeared on the screen. It made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. It's a good movie to bring your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, the D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10, mainly because the kids loved it so much.
