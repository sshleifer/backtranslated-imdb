For those of you who don't refer, clubberin was 4 fists that hit a body ... <br /> <br /> Anyways, on the review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite breaches took place at this stage. I remember seeing Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his working days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I'd be here one while noting everyone. Point is WCW had a fantastic roster in pre Hogan days and they produced entertaining TV. Dusty Rhodes's comments in recent years gave me a whole new reason to see when I started smoking as a teenager ... I really wished Vince would put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe at the next big American bass? The CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
