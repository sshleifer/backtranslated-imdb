I absolutely loved this movie! I do not concern at all the other comments I have read about it. I was totally excited about every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story moving, the seemingly intense, and the direction spot-on. I would literally jump every time the phone would ring near the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, I was well on the verge throughout the film - and the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I found out that there were so many perfect choices made ... casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the movie could have gone to the cheap excitement, but it never did, and for me this movie featured so many of the mediocre thrillers who came out last ... and the last few years.
