As romantic comedies go, this was a sweet and winning one. I thought writing might have been stronger to build the final link a little better, but it's not a big trigger. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give good performances and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them throw as romantic leaders. I hope to see them throw in several projects soon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie won't change your life, but it's sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.
