It is interesting how the research stage can flow. I started looking at an article about Cristo's "The Gates" in Central Park. The article stated that Maysles had been Cristo's filmographers for years. Hmmm ... Then I came to look at their body part. I think one of them has gone further, but the other still plays Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Gray Gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the unclear or offbeat and of course they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past and oh what a brilliant past it was. Edith had been good, born a Bouvier, married well, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was forty years old. Her daughter Edie had been a d√©butante, a fashion model and had many beaus. She never got married and at some point in her thirties had come home to come back. She seems to have a nervous affliction of some sort. Worry too much about things. It's just a shadow of the world they live in because Jackie O. came and spruced up on the spot so her aunt and cousin wouldn't be expelled. It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out. But in the film fresh paint is seen on the walls. If you look carefully at the newspaper clippings, you see it was a very dirty mess. The clothes Edie comes up with a very smart and creative. The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to go naked, but she is not in the movie. Edith was really pretty, and you can still see the shadow of her beauty while singing "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, but not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's portait, she says, "At least someone does what they want"!
