Abe Lincoln's early career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen pictures of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is scary like Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking and other ways - just as you could imagine Lincoln having been. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, stands at the top of his form and evokes America in the early 19th century. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder that Lincoln defends and courtroom scenes are pretty well done. The support ramp contains many of Ford's regulars. This was Alice Brady's last movie when she died months after the release.
