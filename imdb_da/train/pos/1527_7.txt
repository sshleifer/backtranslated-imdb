Savaged when it came out, this movie looks great and sounds good. A feast of intelligent thought-provoking plays from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and turns out - his long, slow take encourages you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condense Shaw without sacrificing complexity. The piece looks like one made for TV movies and is definitely studio-bound, but none the worse for it. Too many contemporary films on 'historical' themes cannot resist being stupid. What would Mel Gibson have made of Maid? Many sounding shots of her on the rack probably, and then sharp on the grill as the flames grab. Premings do none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilty reaction. There are some weak performances, but not enough to cause serious injuries. I caught this movie on TV and didn't expect to see it through, but I was caught. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Johan's history has unexpectedly resonated.
