A long-standing fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette stretches us with his jokes and brings us to tears with his ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent shows Bette us his best from his solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Exciting generations of people, she offers something for everyone. The only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.
