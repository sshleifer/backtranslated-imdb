I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still tore me up. Muppets are so cool, and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is a smart and fun movie for both children and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the band.
