It is rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly obnoxious in short doses throughout the film (eg Big Fat Greek wedding, Me, Me and Irene). There were only a few unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. Everywhere it was a cute movie with similar characters. I thought the end was a bit abrupt. It feels like they should have finished it on the world series for a real bang up finish. The play left a little to be desired, but was created by the pace of history. If I had known that it was a Farrelly brothers movie, I would have assumed that it was a stomach that changed garbage and didn't see it, but it seems that even they are able to accidentally make an okay movie. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good movies.
