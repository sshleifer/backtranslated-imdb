Solved as a satire by D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a full-length comedy feature. The only similarities with intolerance are the opening "book" scene and the fact that similar stories throughout the ages are edited together in a complete movie. Keaton's justification for this style was that if it did not succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three. Fortunately, The Three Ages succeed brilliantly as a comedy and includes some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's movies. There is nothing unique or bold about the story lines. They are simple boy-meeting-girl, boy-loser-girl, boy-get-girl plots, but the period satires are rebellious and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all movies in this genre. However, I don't think anyone has ever topped this comedy. No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton, and the stunts in this movie are some of his best. In addition, Wallace adds Bey's appearance as Keaton's rival to this movie's appeal. Anyone who believes that comedy from the 1920s cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to watch this movie.
