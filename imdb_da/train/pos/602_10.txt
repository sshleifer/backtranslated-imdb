I never danced flamenco before, but somehow I would like this movie to be perfect. The colors where the incredible dancers were, the gypsies and the competitors all set a film that seemed to be prematurely completed. I've seen other Carlos Saura movies and I agree that this movie can be his best production. I feel that the best features of his previous film were put together and adjusted to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors by revealing the activity going on behind the cameras. While I watched this movie, I felt as if I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, where I comfortably saw the dancers on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I don't know how to get a copy of this movie in the US in the coming years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to livelihoods for other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely on my favorite list.
