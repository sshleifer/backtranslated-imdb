On October 24, 1955, the hard-working geologist of Hadley Oil Company Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets with executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of his boss Bill Ryan in New York and urges her to attend a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the road to the meeting, he admits that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the desire of the ruthless Kyle, his best friend since childhood, to eat a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext for Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle soon fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle successfully uses her money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and suggests Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has an incomparable love of Mitch, who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and can be sterile and start drinking again. The jealous Marylee toxins Kyle says his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Lucy finds out she's pregnant, Kyle thinks the baby belongs to Mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written in the wind" is an overstated melodramatic soap opera with artificial figures and situations. There are at least two fantastic films with signs of drinking problems: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with great performance by Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with great performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and clich√©s. Finally, the forgettable "Written on the Wind" is only entertaining and never a feature to be nominated for Oscar. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words of the Wind")
