This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R movies have fantastic dances, but juicy romance stories. This still has the court grain, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This movie not only has great dancers but sympathetic characters and a bunch of good songs. The music is the central theme here, and what's good is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers. She was not only a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and a great figure. She also dances with Fred of course, and they are always a fun couple watching the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing in the 1950s and looking at "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had the short early 30's hairstyle, I recognized her voice immediately. Also in this movie are fast performances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I still don't have Ball. I can't find her, but I know she's in here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, apart from some unpleasant chewing gum-chewing in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although it was better in westerns - also likes. <br /> <br /> This is simply a nice, good movie and good if you want to enjoy the amazing talents of Astaire and Rogers.
