When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet for movie night, there is a movie they insist on watching over and over: You guessed it, K-911, the third installment in the highly successful K-9 franchise starring everyone's favorite tv father, Jim Belushi. People I knew it was possible to carry a VHS tape but a DVD?! This has been played so often that it begins to skip; no joke! But of course you get it when you own a movie so charming, so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must thank the only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the beloved Cop-Dog genre with Turner and Hooch; Although that film does not measure up to the high quality presented in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some say Belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. Although you might suspect that a third installment - direct to video, knows - might not look like something worth looking at, you would prove yourself wrong after seeing this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away the plot, but I would say that Belushi and his panting partner are giving their best performance yet - one that will make you HOWLING with laughter! It's a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what great progress his brother has made in the real world. I highly recommend your teenage daughter introducing this movie to her BFFs at her next sleep party. Don't forget the puppy's chow!
