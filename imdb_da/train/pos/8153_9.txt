This is a really fun movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you see it. It is a beautiful short film, and I definitely recommend seeing it more than once, you will 'get it' again. <br /> <br /> It's like spinal loss, but the rap version. It has a lot of setting in it that can be a negative thing in rap affected movies, but it's just a total p ** s take and is not a problem because of the irony it creates. Lots of stand-out bits, one of these types of movies that you will find yourself quoting lines with your buddies and it will raise laughter. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite part is 'guerrilla in the middle' section. Fantastic video, amazing!
