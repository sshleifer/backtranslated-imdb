Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb are low budget with not good. Whatever this movie may need, more budget is not really part of it. Big sets and lots of special effects would have made it another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. The almost unknown Alexandra City is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty, and it is crucial for this movie to work. Her clever little smile and knowledge of appearance is formidable and you find yourself the camera will not scare the face. It makes it usable that the bad guy Nikolai, who is also a little known (at least in the US), Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau can take an unusual brain interest in her, something Modesty can exploit. She is able to divert her rape with just a push and spit out "stop wasting my time!" then stormed between his heavily armed but suddenly diffused minions. Making such a plausible scene does not happen accidentally. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with the rail-thin City player Modesty is that it just isn't very credible for her to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular leader like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She's just not a Peta Wilson or a pumped up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a compelling blow. The Coaster-Waldau, which can be overwhelmed by the City, looks as though he's only with his sister. <br /> <br /> As this is not an action movie, it's not a big mistake. I just hope they do better if and when they make followers.
