First of all, this movie is almost fifty years old! Still, it still stands out as one of the big movies all the time. I wonder how many of today's discarded celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050? The story is simple but solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I can still remember the first time I saw this as a child when the monster enters the power field that protects the ship, and you have to see its outline for the first (and only) time. If I had shaken fear, I can tell you. Looks dated today, but still more than effective enough. The scenarios with the tiger show their age now. You can see the outline where the tiger was painted in the shoots with Altaira, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect that the creature melts through the Krell doors is done wonderfully. <br /> <br /> It's also great to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for the Airplane and Naked Gun films) as a young, yet mature man. He was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie that will surely continue to be a favorite in the coming years. Timeless.
