During 1933, this film had many cuts taken from it, because it was much over the top of history's content and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do everything to achieve great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced her daughter to prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steelworks in a city with very poor people, and her father ran a speakeasy that led into his home all kinds of men who had eyes with Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets up with a man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy didn't even come to Lily's first base, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave excellent performances. This is a fantastic 1933 movie produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and locked in a bug for many years and has recently been shown on the silver screen. This movie is quite mild compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very rude to watch this type of movie. Enjoy
