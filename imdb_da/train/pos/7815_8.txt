'Cry Freedom' is a film about how far people will go to find the truth. The first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods (played fanatically by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods looking for answers to Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most favor the first half of the film, which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods'. I found the second half about Don Wood's struggle to get Biko's story heard of the world much more interesting.
