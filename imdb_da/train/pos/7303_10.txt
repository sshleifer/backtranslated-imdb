I've only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago I thought the scary moments would be pretty tame. Boy was I wrong. There are some good moments that shook my spine. Even plays were amazing, Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing, and Donald Pleasance was amazing. On the downside, it can be quite slow to start, but when it does, no one stops. It makes all copycats, eg. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can't really say it's Carpenter's best because I haven't seen many of his, the only one I can remember is his Starman (I think he did). Halloween is the crooked performance of the horror genre.
