This movie probably had a $ 750 budget and still managed to surpass the Titanic. I rented this the day I crashed my mother's car and that was the only thing that cheered me out of faith! it must bind with 'The Assassin of the Killer Bimbos'. Things to look for are: 1. The vehicle in blow job Chinese girl scene 2. The bleaching blonde in the sassong shirt that never changes 3. Flinstone-like screaming out drive 4. The collapsing ensemble worn by redheads just before she gets killed , I do not ruin any surprises, because it is sooo predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to pay tribute. 6. The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by stabbing a manic. 7. The hour long hunt at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. Womman writes graffiti in the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least the wonderful special effects - especially the pin in the bubble that made a ... the sky helps me ... popping noise. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br />
