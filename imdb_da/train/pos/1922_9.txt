Let me first say that this show was top level when John Ritter was there. After his death, the show hit a bit, but the producers did not show up and added James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The fishing centers around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, he rested in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would scream in laughter (and proud to admit what I am), but now he's gone, I just want to laugh a little with the occasional hearty grin. I am very pleased that I came to this show's trance after Ritter's early death because it made the EPS with Ritter so much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is as well-acted and well-rounded that you can't help but love him. He always bosses the girls around dating, but he really wants them to be happy. It is the ultimate father hates boyfriend entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also amazing and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death, her character gives such good influence and strength to not only her children, but I think Sagal has shaped Cuoco's, David's and Spaniards' lives because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest on the show should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: beautiful, slow, dim-witted, but she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent blonde humor and how sad she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson may get a bit annoying like Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only flaw in the show is that the show never really gives Kerry something to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as the lonely Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, he is the most comical material. After Ritter's death, the show gives some stories to Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are anything but laughs, with the occasional side story of C.J. Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father as some background information. All in all, I give this show a good review because it's a good show that has had a tragic event that hit it. You enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - spy
