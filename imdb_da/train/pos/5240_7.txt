Some of the actors were a little suspicious. I remember asswipe Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yes OK, he's now dead) launched in a rant about this movie, which said it was a disgrace that exclaimed NI Protestants as murderers. Now for all NI Protestants, this movie was loosely based on Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) and who walked Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moan about this movie is it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all stupid and gloomy, i think the little girl must eventually die. Maybe it sounds corny, but it could have taken the beat that not all Prods & tiags are bad or quite good either.
