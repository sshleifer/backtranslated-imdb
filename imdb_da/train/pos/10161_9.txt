I took a flyer in renting this movie, but I have to say it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography and high production values ​​etc. Evidence Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in room / com of bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston who mug and call it acting. Who does it think? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class of their own in this regard and should try to endure projects as well as "Over Her Dead Body." Lake Bell is also excellent and this is the first time I've seen her. And finally, Paul Rudd will shine in a really good movie, instead of smaller movies. A movie like this never gets its fees from close men. It's too bad. As other IMDb reviewers have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem - no hack writing or acting. <br /> <br /> And its depiction of modern L.A. and California generally makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean and otherwise outstanding in every way. Never before has a film made by L.A. Look so good. Oh, what a little talent and a lot of care can do for a movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal the plot, but as a prolonged and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme to enjoy a brilliant and light hearted entertainment. It reminds me a lot about the old "Topper" movies, which were also so funny. <br /> <br /> This movie exhibits popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like "Ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap they attach. We already know that public taste leans heavily towards mediocre. Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy. But if you've enjoyed others overlooked gems like "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc. You will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> A first-class job all around (though it's a little hard to believe in a straight guy, it's possible to be gay for more than five years.) But even though the plot unit doesn't detract the film's overall expertise.
