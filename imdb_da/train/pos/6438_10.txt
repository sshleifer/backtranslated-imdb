"So as I heaven" .. as above so below .. the very special point where divine and human meet. I ADORE this movie! A gem. YES wonderful grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply moved by its very human quality. I laughed and cried through an entire register, actually several octaves of emotion. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, a first-class passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and extraordinary talent shine through in every scene, every interaction, in each meeting. I was totally fascinated, enchanted and captured the story, which is our collective history, the very story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also so extensive with many archetypes, messiah, wounded children, magic children, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abused, victim, bullying, divine fool - ALL signs so real and true to life - everyone aroused great love and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> Watching such a thoughtful yet thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining movie is a great experience. Oh .. must not forget the heavenly choir of angels and breathtakingly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANKS ALL - This Swedish movie will surely catch people all over the world. BRILLIANT!
