A very addictive series. I had never seen an exact combination of drama, action, excitement and Sci-fi never before. I am impressed with each chapter. The manuscript is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators invent all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, problems, stormy relationships, it gives the show the human sense needed to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that all the characters are related among them: The numbers they've met before without knowing it, and so on. The other enigmatic security systems and the Darma initiative are elements that do not allow us to lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think of creating this amazing story?
