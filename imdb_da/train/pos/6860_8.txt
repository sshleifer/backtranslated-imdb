Psychotic transsexual Bobbi kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) by a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then pursues the inexpensive prostitute (Nancy Allen), who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) suspects the crime and joins the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. It can be summed up with a few words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look good), it's very bloody - with that kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies, and boy is it well crafted. Author / Instructor De Palma's script is OK, but it really takes a back seat to the man's film-making abilities. It is extremely successful at visceral level and I am actually involved / interested in these signs. I can see the standard De Palma shelves for / ripoffs by Hitchcock - at least from one of the master's pictures. <br /> <br /> On top of that, it has a professional and credible throw. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) <br /> <br /> That was the dancer actress Rachel Ticotin a of the production assistants. There is a little trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't think a thriller could be classic and bloody at the same time, but this picture pulls it out. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is a typical striking Pino Donaggio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
