Shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful movie I've seen all year long. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly where the inmates have tried and performed another Shakespeare game every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, all of whom are in for the most serious of crimes. The truth is really alien than fiction - if anyone tried to adapt this story to a fiction movie, the audience would never buy it, but knowing it is real makes it great to see - literally; I gasped loudly as I learned about a particularly gifted crime crime. It's like a blurry episode of Oz, and the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
