The production of Baghdad's Thief is quite a story to himself, almost as wonderful as the story told in this movie. Alexander Korda almost broke the film. According to the Citadel Film series Book on The Great British Films, the adopted son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda had already perceived this film in 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But the Second World War was unfortunately taken up by Korda and the cost of recording a big play. <br /> <br /> Budgeting also happens in American movies, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille or any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while filming the movie. Part of the way through the slider, Korda transported the entire company to America and shot these sequences with Rex Ingram as the genius of our Grand Canyon. He would certainly not get such a thing in the UK. Korda also completed the interior of Hollywood, all the way to a release on Christmas Eve 1940. <br /> <br /> The play of the play earned The Thief Of Baghdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color chemistry, best art & set direction for one color film and the best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been very happy to decide to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures from that place. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects do not overcome the simple story of good triumph over evil. The good thing is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez, and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the wizard who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both of which belong to Duprez. This was Veid's career role until Casablanca where he played Luftwaffe Major Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, getting a little help from an unlikely source. Tigger's boy and thief Sabu, who may well have been one of the few who could call himself at that time an international movie star. Literally growing from poverty that served as an elephant stable boy to Maharajah of Mysore, he was spotted by Alexander Korda, who needed a native leadership for one of his jungle qualities. Sabu captures all youth innocence and evil as he fulfills the Arabian nights fantasy of the boy who overturns a tyrant. Not a bad message to send out in 1940 on it. <br /> <br /> The background for Baghdad remains remarkably good today. It is an eternal tale of love, romance and adventure in any order you want to put it.
