**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go Forward, make my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth series in the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was rumored to rule most of the Magnum Force) and he brings back the violent community from the first two movies. However, the film still lacks power and credibility. This film was released in the early 80s, the time of Regan and the young Republicans. The pastor of a raped woman who takes revenge on her rape does not appeal to this time frame. This plot would have been better for Enforcer, who would actually have made it a good movie. What a sudden impact was needed was a plot like in Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
