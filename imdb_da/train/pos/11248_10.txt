Further (for forgery) comes from Latin verb 'whores' so you are warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet provided and intelligent (!) Activity voice from a complex and as it may seem absurd and vain personal history whatever it may be; and yet I feel fascinated by treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after many years ago I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! In the beginning I was so boring, if not for the surprising style of writing (I really began to love Le Carre after the novel). The protagonist is not at all crazy: he has chosen to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel, you can clearly understand the darker version of Greens' Our Man in Havana, written by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; There is no game left that ends it either in tragedy or in a grotesque comic way, or both. There is no Smiley here to maintain decent human qualities in the 'service', or at least there is no time to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done an excellent job on these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are great, like the places and sets; Of course the script here is excellently adapted. Be warned though someone may find it ridiculous, the aftertaste is bitter.
