I really like this movie. I can see it regularly and not tired of it. I suppose it's one of my criteria for a great movie. The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very lethal. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the sixth gift, his last student, to try to make the mistakes he suspects some of his students committed. How will the last student find the other toxins? How will he know which of them is bad? How these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also see that the poison fight each other in any combination. It is fun to see how their styles match. <br /> <br /> To see if you like kung fu movies, it's a good movie to start with. It doesn't get any better than this.
