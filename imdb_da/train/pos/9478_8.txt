This is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. It is quite an exciting dramatic story, with also romance present in it. The story is told slowly, but it seems too good for its construction. The characters are great and portrayed nicely by its actors. Usually I'm not too big a fan of the Asian acting style, but the play in this movie was simply good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is quite different in its approach and style from other genre films produced in the West. In this way, this film is more advanced already with its approach than the Western film made in the same era. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the movie, the visual style would have been a little better. For a movie that is considered a kind of art house film, this movie definitely lacks some great sequencer. It was of course quite a cheap movie to make, and it was made quite generic. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this movie from being completely independent and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh, this movie is about its well-constructed story and characters in it. In this respect, this movie does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
