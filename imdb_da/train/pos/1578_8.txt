Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in adversity. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish men have been locked in waiting for expulsion. An aristocrat who is preached by his family, Lena Fischer, finds herself among the mob as the ordinary godly sister. But rank and privilege deserve no particular consideration. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't serve the kingdom as a female reluctant whose husband is on the Ostfront to learn. In one of the most frightening scenes in the movie, the guards take the wedding from their soldier's husband. <br /> <br /> Learn that you think this is typically German brutishness. We in America today have Lady Bush immediately arresting the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US service members killed in action) because their very presence is offensive. Unfortunately, it has changed over the last 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. Fortunately, the eight-year-old daughter escapes Ruth. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold of Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is first reluctant to take Ruth in a way that we typically take German. Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and against Holocost, warns Lena against it. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea of ​​an American rebellion that even renames Ruth, the more aryan-sounding name Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The amount ends positively on Rosenstrasse, but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah sets out for her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena under cover to write a personal story of the war. I found it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family, but never controlled the fate of her grandfather, who was last known for serving on the Ostfront.
