When I watched this movie on video last night, I kept getting those tingles who told me that this will endure. I have a feeling that I will see it again and again in the coming years. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story / movie. And although some cultural references are unclear to me, a western viewer, the core is a universal narrative.
