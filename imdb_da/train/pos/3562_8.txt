Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the leader of New York's long-established floating craps game, and he needs $ 1000 to secure a new location. He is sure of his odds, he offers the city's highest roll, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he cannot cope with the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is such a great musical because it smoothly mixes the contrasting styles of film and scene. During a dazzling opening order, pedestrians move in rhythm, stop and start as if responding to backstage signals. Even the migratory movements themselves are stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz New York City is a sparkling flurry of art deco color and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even underground games and criminal acts seem quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I just received a word that Jean Simmons has passed at the age of 80. This was incredible the first time I saw her in a movie, but she dazzled me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually repressed Sara comes out of her shell after an alcohol binge in Havana, and lets herself go with an adorably playful rendition of "If I Was a Mountain". Although both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to condemn their vocals and claimed that "maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you." In spite of Goldwyn's detained trust, the couple do well to carry all the musical songs themselves. Simmons suggests the same childlike liveliness that Audrey Hepburn may have brought to the role, and Brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice is not entirely there.
