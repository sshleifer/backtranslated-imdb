Tripping Over. I must first say that I was a little disappointed with the first episodes, but I had faith in the show and Abe Forsythes undoubted talent. I continued to see. I can safely say that I am happy that I did. History developed quite well, and all characters have a strong base, and most lack information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation occupied by the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some great actors combined with a star pot really get this show across the line. Here's hoping for another season!
