Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, which is a traditional rendition of gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real sense of how the world of Jesus looked (I have been there too), and June comes into Mary Magdalene's part with a passion. Cash story is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was displeased. 2. There is no edge to the story that Cash puts in some of his faith-based music. 3. Because it's uncomplicated, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again. <br /> <br /> I want to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
