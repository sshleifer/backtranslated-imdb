One of the best movies out there. Yes, perhaps the cinematography is not the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. Great on time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something else than the usual movies and fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fight in giant robots, the actors gave a fantastic performance and made it all worthwhile. The sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I have loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and not something you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a great view and a lot of fun.
