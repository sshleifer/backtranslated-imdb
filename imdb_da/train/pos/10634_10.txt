To stop her gay friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have their separate lives when they fall asleep one night after Albert's birthday party and then to love. Later in the movie after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert to cheat and show up at her job one night late after the closure. What she finds will leave the viewer amazed. This is a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good at their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. Very controversial in publishing in 1978 is the "R" qualified movie now "PG" in this much more liberal time. Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment on special features and it states that the film was based on an actual story, so the viewers who say the movie is not "right" are mistaken. Everyone is individual and different people fall in love for various reasons - these are the issues explored in this amazing movie for anyone who has ever loved!
