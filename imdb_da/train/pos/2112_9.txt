In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; she bites with colleague James Stewart (like Alfred Kralik). The two do not meet at work because each one has fallen in love with an invisible pen friend. Seeing Ernst Lubitsch right these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Even better is a subplot that involves shop owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek) who suspects his wife has an affair. Hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing, "she just didn't want to grow old with me," and the supporting signs are what keeps this movie from getting old. <br /> <br /> ********* The buy around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
