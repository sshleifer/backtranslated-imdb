I have to admit that I have not read the original M R James story, although I have read many of his other supernatural tales. I've also seen most of the former BBC Christmas Ghost Stories, and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of those who only correspond to Signalman. <br /> <br /> I really can't fault the A View From a Hill - the direction and the 'mood' are perfect, like the play, the lighting and of course the story and the writing. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team. I understand the BBC is planning to do something more (not necessarily based on M R James stories), so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
