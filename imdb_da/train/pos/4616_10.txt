The title of this movie is taken from a pageant called "Seven Minutes in Heaven." The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, NY, and he describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen kissing games. According to the rules, a boy's name and a girl would be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to enter a dark closet together and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would be speculation among party guests about whether the two had the nerves of holding hands, embracing and / or kissing each other in the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the leader would say "Time's up" or knock on the locker door and the couple would come out of the closet. After being quizzed by the other guests, the couple had to admit what they had done during their "seven minutes in heaven". Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The couple who admitted doing the most would be the winners of the game. Such games have served as social "icebreakers" for children and teenagers, but they can be embarrassing and scary for shy people. . The film has been given this title because it deals with the teenagers' first experiences with hugs and romantic love.
