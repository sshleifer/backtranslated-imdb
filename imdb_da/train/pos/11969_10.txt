I loved this show growing up and I still see the first season DVD for 19 years today. What can I say? I grew up in a house much like the one at Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I suppose the only difference was that I didn't live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Also I grew up with my mother in the house. I do not know what I would have done without Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them because I'm the family member like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values ​​because I don't really like any of the O.C-like shows today. I also like the Comedy of Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girls' uncle, father's friend and father. The story says that after the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend Joey and his sister-in-law, Jesse, go in to help raise the kids. Three men are trying to raise three young girls = fun. Each character at Full House is full of heart, fun and truly credible. Joey is a hopeful comedian with a child's heart and soul. Jesse is the cool motorcycle riding, tough guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces, and later his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
