No one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (How could 1945 war movies be a masterpiece?) And yet this is a highly effective story of a true story, namely Al Schmidt, blind at Guadalcanal, as played by John Garfield, who spent days wearing blindfolded to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions. Robert Leckie, in "Hjelm for my pillow", denies Schmidt's popularity in favor of his foxhole friend, who was killed and wrote that "the country must have had living heroes." <br /> <br /> I suppose the country did it. And they had one here. There is a single battle scene in the movie, tied to the studio party, which lasts only ten minutes or so and appears less than halfway through the film rather than being saved to climax, but it is the frightening and most realistic depiction of men under fire which I remember seeing on the screen, including those that save private Ryan. Men shout for fear, scream at each other and against the enemy and bleed and die without the help of color, stereophonic sound, squibs or gore. Just from a technological point of view movie is excellent. It's not just that we learn how complicated a mechanism is a .30 caliber, water-cooled Browning machine gun, or that it has to be fired in bursts of just a few rounds, or it's not being waved like a fire hose, as in so many other war movies. The technical precision adds to the quality of the scene. The need to stick to short bursts is terrible when dozens of screaming enemies lean over a bay fifty feet away with the sole purpose of eradicating you and your two isolated comrades limited to a small gun position. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not bravura, including those of the ubiquitous 1940's, John Ridgeley, and a brilliant youthful Eleanor Parker. The love story of the frames is extra, but it works, and in the end it is completely mobile. A striking dream sequence is included. It's not Bunuel, but for a routine 1945 movie, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script or it may have been modified by another. It could have used the kind of pruning that could have introduced a much-needed ambiguity. Still, there are odd verbal punctuation that has a surprising impact on the viewer - "Why doesn't God kill me?" And, "In the eyes, Lee. Get them in the face!" Depths of anxiety in a few corny words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war movie. <br /> <br /> Notes that may seem fake for a contemporary viewer, but perhaps not: The dated fellows, who are hard to believe because many of today's children could believe, was actually ever spoken - "private gab", "dope", "drop", "gee", "you stupid", "lady", "a bulging guy" and "pamper Let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments. At that time, some of this heavy lingo was at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real Weak Points? The wounded veterans meet and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have, and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion consistent with: "Just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean that people will believe you There are sometimes headlines and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and just imaginative. "Please, God, let him return to me" and that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Now, film producers were operating within the limits of their time. Maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of Independence Hall and the inspirational tribes of "America the Beautiful" swells in the back. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the virtues of the movie, which is significant, especially the impact of the terrible battle scene. It's not so often on television. If you have a chance, catch it at all.
