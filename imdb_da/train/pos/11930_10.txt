This movie was pretty good. I'm not too big a fan of baseball, but it's a movie made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. is brought in with a number of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The reason was credible and I love the message. William Dear and the boys put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films are about true stories or events, and they often don't work well. But this movie hits 10 on the perfection scale, although there were some minor errors here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
