This was a fantastic movie with a good casting, all of which hit all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, it just doesn't get any better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always undervalued, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the manuscript. None of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And neither was her mother playing Keaton. At one point she breaks a promise she made for a sign, not to reveal that he had slept. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film had a "political agenda". It's an enchanting thing to say. There was no policy at all in this movie.
