This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than the week's worth of 'The Young & The Restless'. This is more a return to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than an D'Amato sleavest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes a fantastic transformation from nurse to hot-to-faith streetwalker. Future Italian porn star / politician, Illona Staller, who will later be named Ciccolina (and having sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) plays Emys competition. Exotic sites and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
