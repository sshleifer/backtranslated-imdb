One can only imagine the movie Mr. Welles could be finished without disturbing the study! This movie is a flawless Welles but worth every minute because you can see the greatness of perhaps America's best film director of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the toll it took on the Orson Welles movie of this movie. The story has many gaps in it, perhaps because of the demands of the study leaders who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> Read some of the statements submitted to IMDB comparing Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it comes to all the executives to be considered the followers of the great master himself. No one was more original and creative in American bio's history than Mr. Welles. Fortunately, we still have his legacy either in retrospective appearance as the one just finished by the Film Forum in New York or his film either on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, like a blonde, she is just for the anesthetic of words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie. The only thing that could have made this movie another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welle's body of work was his own appearance in it. Had he concentrated in the director and had another actor interpreted Michael O'Hara, another movie could have been fully achieved. Orson Welles must be credited for being a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio a lot on the street. The visions in this movie are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie really impressed with the work, vision and talent he gave us.
