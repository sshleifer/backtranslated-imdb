Tigerland follows the life of a group of newly-drafted men in the army called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this time, America struggles with a lost battle and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary of several recruited lives in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The movie is more of a character study that is not a real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general. Great play, and very memorable. Also, the director's use of film and style seems so good because it looks a lot like the old movie footage you always see about Vietnam. It is great to see how the movie shows that all bets and problems were so important to the problems of fighting this fight. The special scene where Boz goes away from a training assignment where an instructor shows how to use a radio as a torture unit, summarizes everything about war in a nutshell ... and that's impossible. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not just about Nam, but about who individuals should decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'. <br /> <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
