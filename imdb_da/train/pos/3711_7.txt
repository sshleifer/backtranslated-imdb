"Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton instructed "The Hunter Night", a creepy piece of southern Gothic, where Robert Mitchum plays a frightening serial killer. One of the movie's more famous sequences consists of two children flying from Mitchum on a rowing boat, the children are frighteningly frightening while Mitchum fails for them as a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally eerie killer in "Cape Fear", another movie in the US south. The movie featured a local lawyer trying to protect his family and also joined with Mitchum terrorizing people on a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese tried to branch out and tackle something more common, recreating "Cape Fear", the boat scene and everything. Now we have Robert Altman's "The Gingerbread Man", another part of small town Southern Gothic Altman says he consulted "Hunter's Night" for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream movie solely because he wanted to "spread his wings and try one popcorn picture ", but what he secretly tries to do here, deconstructs the canonical films of the Southern Gothic genres. <br /> <br /> Instead of a showdown on a small boat, we get a showdown on a huge ship. Instead of two children being kidnapped, we get two children who are safely returned to the police. Instead of money being saved, we have money that is easily given through a last will and a will. Instead of the righteous lawyer from the 1961 film and the regrettable lawyer from the 1991 remake, we get a pretty three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the evil ones. Instead of the monster breaking into the family's houseboat, we have the hero hunting the monster aboard the monster's "house ship". Similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer, we get an innocent entertainment played by Robert Duvall. . . etc etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues to turn everything just a little bit, pull the edges and make his own things. His touch is most visible in the film's first half-hour, where the film exists in an uncomfortable space between conventional plot-driven film history and Altman's love of overlapping dialogue, laid-back narratives, fighting camera handling, and the way characters are not so much involved as they are just part of what is going on. <br /> <br /> Still, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is also bound to the "thriller format" conventions to do much damage, his style is too blunt to generate excitement, and the movie is simply not radical enough to counteract other canonical films in the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is far too mainstream to act as a purer Altman movie and also Altman to act as a mainstream thriller. However, the film is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually unacceptable Daryl Hannah are all in juicy performances. The film also has a good mood against a nearby hurricane, and the final action contains some interesting phrases. Although it's not the complete disaster that Scorsese is "Cape Fear", the film is still nothing special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 90s, Altman made 3 consecutive films in the American South: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike "Gingerbread Man", both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" tackle the broader and lightweight canvas that Altman was most comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is more important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frames would prove to be influential in all Serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookies Fortune", while a much slimmer story may be the better picture. Note: Altman claims this is his first thriller, but he instructed "Images," an art house thriller, in 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth having a view.
