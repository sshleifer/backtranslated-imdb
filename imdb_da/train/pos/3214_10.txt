I fell in love with this silent act of drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played so well. Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped from a childhood after being obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers. <br /> <br /> The scene is set and another classic action movie icon was born - SOLDAT. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and did it all to his - original, bold and overly human. I miss the fact that successors were never made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br /> <br />: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
