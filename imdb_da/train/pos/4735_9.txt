I saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. Then I went home and looked at subtitles, and I loved it. I'm ready to see it again. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for the mild-fashioned secret identity and what could be more mildly gentle than a pacifist librarian? The scenes where he reveals his superpowers to his friends or absent mindedly forget to be gentle are my favortites. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts is amazing. There really isn't much I can say about them if you are familiar with the HK style. But if you're not ... we stopped playing cards and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. We noticed that after every strike was a cut. Not in black mask. <br /> <br />
