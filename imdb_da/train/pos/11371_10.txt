This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic performance. From the beginning I was completely enveloped in the (true) story, since Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) is crying while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to hurt him until we remember what he is. Psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, marvelously played by Max Von Sydow, was completely credible in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union has been made far too clear by the local communist commissioner Bondarchuk's behavior of Joss Ackland. For me, however, the excellent performance was from Donald Sutherland, which again shows what a great actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts the silence of the lamb into the shadow, from the atmospheric and gloomy Soviet landscape to the overall notions of all involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
