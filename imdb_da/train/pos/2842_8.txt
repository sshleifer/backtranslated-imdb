New York I love you like its predecessor (Paris Je T'Aime) is a combination of different stories that reflect the different kinds and aspects of love, but unlike that, the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter. The film offers a unique view of the city of New York with its diverse and diverse landscapes. New York, I Love You offers a first-rate cast featuring as great actors as Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Ian McKellen, Hayden Christensen, Chistina Rcci and Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawke, James Caan and Robin Wright Penn among others and some good authors and directors such as Brett Ratner and Anthony Mingella.
