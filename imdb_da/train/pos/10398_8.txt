Although time has revealed how some of the effects were made, this story of love and adventure is still special. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie before being shocked at how much you've stolen later movie makers. I saw this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the movie. They loved the movie and enjoyed being such a touchstone for so many other movies and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I have given the movie an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10, which is where a large portion of this movie lives because over the last 15 minutes the movie falls apart pacing. Everything is rushed as if they suddenly have to come to the end. From the point of the end of the jinn to the end, it seems to be more sketched, then finished painting. It doesn't kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Continue the necessary viewing for anyone who loves a good adventure or even a great movie.
