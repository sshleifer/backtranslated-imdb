My favorite "Imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure movies from all the time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold and clever cracks to please everything but the most "PC" of moviegoers. Memorable scenes abound - the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys are fighting for hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote the nailed punch ("save some to the elephant"); Cutter for MacChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; Your breaks Cutter out of jail with a fork ("what do you think I break out of? A bleeding pudding?!) And the incredible temple scene with Cutter sings and then annoucing, bold as brass -" Okay, you're all arrested! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but that's enough to say I'm trying to capture this movie when it's on. For armchair adventurers and generals it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.
