Gerard is a writer with a slightly overactive imagination. He is also gay and Catholic inclined to Catholic guilt and some of a clairvoyant, or it seems. On a trip to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of gross trade, he has been far from far and he decides to stick to it. After all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensation. Then he realizes that Christine's former three husbands have all died violent deaths. Has Christine murdered them and is he or her boyfriend Herman, becoming the fourth man? Verhoeven's overheated, over-genuine melodrama is a delicious mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images and a horrible mass of red color. Much of the time it looks and feels like a dream, and we can never be sure that what we see is genuine or a figure of Gerard's imagination. The fun thing is to find out. Also, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more sympathetic character, like either the priggish Gerard or the Hussian Herman means that we can hardly root for any of the men over her. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's comedy can't come soon enough. Super performances also from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and let Verhoeven's best movie up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
