You know the story - a group of bold non-aspirations goes into a competition, they seem to have no chance of winning - it's a story that has been made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best, etc.). Now Korea is giving it a ride with a Taekwondo team fighting for honor? and guess what ?? The result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall flat on the face is down to the talented young cast who really cares about the characters, and this again keeps you looking to the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie can be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of motion and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films; the action is limited to (albeit impressive) kicks and occasional blows. It doesn't matter as it is the interaction between the characters and their struggle to do something by themselves, making this movie a success.
