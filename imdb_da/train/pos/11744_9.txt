"Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle" is rooted in a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some kind of degradation or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past, how his emotions are revealed is surprising. Spall's range of emotions being transported, moving right and more than he usually will portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertoire. <br /> <br /> While an expected boring school bus tour has only been used for comics, such as "The Simpsons", this central situation for a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in the Rhidian Brooks script is well enclosed and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into actions. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to urban British assortment of racist and religiously different children (with their uniforms I couldn't tell if this is a "private" or "public" school) when they gather ?? they raped black children, the serious South Africans and Muslims, the white bulls and the average girls? but is communicated quite naturally and individually. The young actors, some of whom I recognized from British television as "shameless", were bubbly in representing the usual selection of junior high social pressure. Celia Imrie puts more warmth in the role of the tutor than the martinettes she normally has to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain entertaining ignorant. We believe as the teacher designed by Ben Miles of "Coupling" that we will be cut with a didactic lesson on religious tolerance, but it is much more about faith in people as well as God, why the BBC showed it in England during Easter time and BBC America showed it in the US over Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good in "Summer of Love", has a key role in Mr. Harvey's redemption that could have been played for the film-of-week sermon, but touches when they reach each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately, I saw their intense scene interrupted by advertising). <br /> <br /> While it is a bit of heavy hands several times pointedly called this road trip "a pilgrimage", this quiet movie was the best evocation of "good will toward men" than I have seen in most holiday themed TV movie.
