I really didn't expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; in fact it was pretty good. This movie featured a couple of the funniest pieces of writing I've ever seen from a movie. Now I don't say this is one of the funniest movies all the time, but I laughed hard at some parts. "The police ruled my father's death suicide. They said he fell into an elevator shaft." On some bullets ". Now this movie is not for everyone, the stupidest humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies I would recommend you remove it. All in all, it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes ending up being real heroes at last, it is a very overstated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before I saw it, it expected to be complete garbage. I'm finally why this movie was able to bring together a superstar that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even that kid from Good Burger, because Mystery Man is full of excellent comic writing period 7 out of 10 A very big surprise.
