Jane Porters former love interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) come to Tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment looking for the ivory gold mine, which is "Elephant's cemetery" first seen in Tarzan, APE MAN ... only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions ... for Jane. Will Tarzan do it? Unlikely (Tarzan won't even pose any disturbance to "Elephant's Cemetery") and knowing that Martin is trying to take Tarzan out of the picture, he later finds himself in a world of trouble later, he and his party ( including Jane, who leaves them after she thinks Tarzan is dead) is trapped by an original tribal sensation to feed them to the lions .. will Tarzan be willing and able to come to them in time? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with lots of scenes involving Tarzan and others turned down wild animals and a climax that grabs the viewer's interest and does not give up. The horror shown to animals and the decor of the natives can disturb some today, but everyone should remember that this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
