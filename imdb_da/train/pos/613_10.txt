Please future authors, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen such a bold and original story created for the big screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy films are safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and bold. just when you think 'oh, I've seen this before' or 'I'm sure that's what will happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more in history. <br /> <br /> The actors are good - even the smallest part is performed with such talent, it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. Robert De Niro is beautiful and energetic, just stealing the show in every scene he is in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names make excellent roles. I had been filling everyone trying to give his best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he invented "for this universe - is simply outstanding. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on a pre-screening today, one day before the official release, and hope It will be a great success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. The look of Yvaine's eyes, Captain Shakespeare's passions, the passion of passion - Impressive and unforgettable <br /> <br /> is this the first entertaining movie from 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Excellent <br /> <br /> Peace and Love
