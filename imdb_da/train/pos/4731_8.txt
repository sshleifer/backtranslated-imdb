This is definitely one of Jets best efforts. Few players are able to play stoic as Jet Li can. The action is quick fire, and special effects increase for intensity purposes. As a result, it can take Americans a bit of watch. A small suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I feel it's an excellent introduction to Jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially the Fist of Legend) that make it into the US market. A great mix of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most actions flick enthusiasts.
