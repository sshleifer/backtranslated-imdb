I can't really condemn the movie because it works. There are enough movie noir items to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's only in the category. There is nothing scary in this piece, and this is where the noir elements fail. Sure the disease can be considered scary, but I find it hard to see it. The movie points to a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking, the New Orleans police are just too willing to arrest a reporter, the ghost's ghost hangs over all the people in the movie ... but that's just the only hints. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motivations with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a human page to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous whose human trafficking was actually played. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what fails the movie at last. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the play is good, the writing and direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this a movie you have to return to over and over again. Worth seeing once, maybe twice, if you can't remember it from years ago and then put away.
