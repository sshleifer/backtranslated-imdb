This movie is absolutely fun. The reason is a serial killer who has somehow become a snowman through some bi-chemical accidents. he then leads to the city and begins to terrorize the locals. It's up to the local police chief and some other signs trying to stop him. It's made on a small budget and it certainly shows, but the big thing about this movie is that it knows it's bad. The improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene, which mimic the giant killing snowman, are classic, and it is clear that it is one of the few films that has its budget as its primary selling point. Along with the comic stickiness, there are some other good comedy moments - listen right at the beginning to vote for a father who scares his children to death and the funniest rape scene ever committed to filming. great tacky fun
