I appreciated photography, textures, colors and often, unlike a comment, the lighting. What was lacking for me was a coherent story. I often found it uneven, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one of 125m. The cuts and subtitles may not help. I welcome any movie escaping the Hollywood Shadow, but it left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the show was all fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another movie that has some affinity with this, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
