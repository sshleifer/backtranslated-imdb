WARNING!!! TONE OF DEATH GIVEAWAYS !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT SEE THIS SERIES! Or you can, whatever. <br /> <br /> They are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; Liars, cheating, maybe even some words that can't speak. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series was old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stopped for his final breathing, this movie was it. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a parody of the Wizard of Oz. Then you see a child named John Doe, who is the last child of Springwood, Ohio, leaving and coming out of the Freddy area. A woman living in a hospital / place to get the children away from their feet kind of place meets this boy and at the same time has a dream of a man, a water tower and a promise of a secret flowing in her mind, goes back to Springwood to find out this scary sight, and soon find out that she is Freddy's child, and we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a host to him. And beyond that, scares follow. This movie seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This movie features tons of humor and cameo skills such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic flower and Iron Butterfly's "In- a-gadda-da-vida ", so stuck in a super Mario parody of sorts. This movie will either make you hate this movie or as Krueger even more. The best of the best.
