This is surprisingly above average slasher, it's fun and well made, with some decent gore!. All the characters are decent and the story is very fun, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a $ 1 and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty amazing for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer had, as it was actually scary. The finals were really cool when I loved how they defeated the killer, and the end was predictable also very funny, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly beautiful. It is decently made and written, and I thought it was also quite creative and original at times, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer didn't shoot around and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like myself) really should enjoy this movie, plus the opening was also vicious also with them filming the movie! This is a surprising above average slasher, it's fun and well made, with some decent gore, and I say it's worth seeing! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall is doing well! Jobs here with solid camera work using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast moving pace. The action is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well, and I had trouble getting her bored when she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better at the end, but not much, I'm surprised she decided to make this movie, however she does an excellent job! Frank Roberts is great as a killer, he is threatening, scary and had a hell of a mask, and this guy hasn't messed around, he was great! Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her little role. Jessica Napier is sweet and does fine as the other heroine. The rest of the throw is fine. Overall, worth seeing!. *** out of 5
