ATTENTION, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> Many people told me that "The Apes Planet" was Tim Burton's worst movie and, apart from the much weaker than the original movie. So I decided not to see it. Another of my friends who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it despite this, because "a Tim-Burton movie is still a Tim-Burton movie." I decided to do it and I found out he was right. <br /> <br /> Obviously, remake of such a famous movie as "Planet of the Apes" is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Nevertheless, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his strange health as well as `Beetlejuice 'or' Batman '. If you are already fond of Burton movies, it is hard not to like one of his movies, though it has some flaws: nerve-wrapping monkey squeals, dressed monkeys, and a leading actor who could have been easily replaced by another . <br /> <br /> What the movie gives us in the first place is an answer to the question: What is the result when Tim Burton is instructed to make a remake? First of all, Burton would not be Burton if he would not refuse to call it a remake from the beginning; it is a 're-imagining'. On the other hand, Burton says that almost all viewers of his movie have seen the very first movie version with Charlton Heston (as a human) and he knows that remake does not exist without his model and that the two films will not stop comparing. So all he does is play with this comparison at every moment of his movie, eg by referring to quotes. As for the story, Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions about the original first and then driving the entire audience into despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the film with ?? AND HERE IS THE SPOILER ?? Leo comes back to earth and finds himself in a world that apparently has been ruled by monkeys forever. <br /> <br /> Now this is the burtonesque response to people's expectations they hold due to the astonishing and shocking end of the first "Apesens Planet". One end, even more unexpected, more amazing and: absolutely confusing because ?? and here I disagree with various 'Planet of the Apes' websites and platforms ?? that does not make sense. There can be no meaning to it, or just so complicated that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton plays his cruel games, he does it with a laugh, and he does well. Burton fans will surely like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some kind of fashionism. Well, and I don't think manufacturers will ever ask Burton to redo a remake ??
