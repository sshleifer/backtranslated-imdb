Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in Big City. The women are there to ask, and the men are mostly "tutti-fruttis." Extensive, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, worse than the other. In the midst of that chaos, he meets and turns to Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless man living in an apparently damned building. <br /> <br /> There is not much history as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes designed to bring not only Joe Bucks blame into the city but also cut his past and show us in cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences excerpt from his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was raped, his surrender of his mother and his apparent abuse of his grandmother, who also had a habit of raising men for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the clever beginning, when Nilsson plays through the opening credits his deceptive "Allers Talking"; we feel that even if we want Joe to make his mark in the city, the odds are high he will not and will end up working for pennies in a dead job - shown in a masterful shot from his outside look later in the movie, when he sees a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know from his eyes in his eyes, he does not want to end like this. <br /> <br /> A dark story with dashed hopes creates John Schlesinger haunting images of lost souls in the late 60s and in the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make a kind of meaning to their lives amidst the unpleasant consolation of dignified life. There is the implicit notion that they might have been lovers - Ratso reaching out to squeeze Joe into the party scene and their final embrace at the end certainly points to this - but it's essentially a buddy movie, one that survives, literally to death, and bring some sort of hope to Joe, who at the end of Florida seems much changed, older, wiser.
