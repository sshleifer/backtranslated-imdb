I saw the German version of the movie on German television, and I was really amazed at it. I can generally see documentaries, but I can't remember having seen one that is better than 'Earth'. I knew some of the scenes from Youtube videos that I found by random browsing. I also remember having seen parts of the movie on multimedia stores running on the high definition TVs shown. After watching the movie, it is obvious to me why the recordings are so popular among Youtube users and multimedia merchants: It's just so amazing and spectacular that you can't help but stare at the screen, whether you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation a 10 out of 10. There are probably more exciting movies, but with regard to documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best of its genre.
