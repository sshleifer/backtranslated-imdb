By God it has been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (children) everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally composed - Disney animation, as well as human actors - It was directed by Frank Capra, for the sake of pete! <br /> <br /> Kind of an overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film strip worth having information about the human body? But boy will the children who see it learn: Even now I can clearly remember that Dr. Baxter is challenged by Hemo himself to mention which common material resembles the human blood that the doctor immediately corresponds to "sea water".
