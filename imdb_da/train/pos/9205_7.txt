This grew on me. I love R.D. The Burman music, and in spite of the raw elements of the story, I found much to be moved off as I continued to watch the film again. The brother sister's plot line is powerful, I thought; There are also more likely mandatory things like bar fighting, a loony crime story, etc. that are just distracting. (Although it is not invisible from a particular point of view.) The English translation is also determined by a person for whom it was a bit of a stretch, and as whimsical as it is I am grateful to him for doing so. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, this is melodramatic and opera-like, including a song that was first sung by a little boy to encourage his mistreated and unhappy sister, and then sold it same song 12 or so years later by the man who has traveled to Kathmandu seeking to reconnect with this girl, adult and uneasy (she had been told that her brother and mother were dead) and felt the pain of drugs. <br /> <br /> A great thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement that brought hordes of asylum seekers to India, from an Indian point of view that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger caused by the mistakes of their own societies, yet in India, which only lives for the joy of the moment. Hippie-song-dancing scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I feel quite sure that the masses of young white-framed children are real hippie extras that I remember hearing about children the caravan to the east gets this kind of work in bollywood. <br /> <br /> (it's not about the actual Hare Krishna movement, though the movie hippies sing a krishna / rama chant, like a group of actual Indian devotees, unrelated to the hippies, in the movie's movie). /> <br /> ~ Virginia
