Now the story is a bit difficult to follow for the first time, but it is only because of all the bare breast 70's painted vampire / witches that dance to the bongo drums. Of course, this is interrupted by a few vampire orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for girl on girl action, vampire or not ... this movie just rocks !!!
