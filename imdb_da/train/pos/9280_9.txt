In Iran, women are officially banned from men's sporting events. In June 2005, Iran's national football team has an important game against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium to qualify for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football dress as boys and attempts to enter the stadium are being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo's team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; therefore I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi, from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" shot this film the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the nicest movies I've ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
