"Sasquatch Hunters" was actually not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Entering the Forest, Park Rangers Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) escort Dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White) Her Chief Dr. Ethan Edwards, Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find the site of some recognized bones found in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a huge burial ground and several strange bones that throw the area. When members of the group begin to disappear, they begin to wander through the forest for safety. It has been discovered that a Sasquatch is behind the killings and team ties together to survive. <br /> <br /> The good news: It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The movie really starts to fetch some steam around the halfway point when the creature attacks. It is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subjected to attack by the creature, and the voltage throughout the playback is extremely high. The wooded area is most conveniently milked in these parts, increasing the tension and wondering when a single person wandering in the forest will get their comeuppance. Also scattered quite liberally through the film is the effective use of off-screen ditches and roars that are really onworldly. They really add a lot to make this part so creepy, as well as the other times the mocking scream is heard. It's pretty efficient and works well. It is pretty nice that the later part of the movie picks up the pace, as it goes well on a high action. A scene especially I feel must point out as a special scene at first viewing. As a man runs through the forest from the creature, he tracks the expedition that has gone on looking for it. He raises his hands for help, and the other he goes to announce his presence, he is attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite quickly. It surprised me and gave me a little jump at first view. The Bad News: There were only a few things to complain about here, and one is a common complaint. The creature here is mostly done by horrible CGI, which made him look quite ridiculous and destroy any credibility it may have had. The air of threat created by the opening of the film is almost shot out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It is so distracting that it is a shame, a little more work was not put into it. I have complained about this a lot, and that is something that really needs to be done away with as it does not look so realistic and is rather false. Another big is off-screen killer in here. Very often in the movie a person is seized and then yanked away, and then to find the bloody body afterwards. It is quite aggravating when the killings look good and juicy afterwards. Otherwise, I don't really have much of a problem with this, as everything else that is usually criticized for not really disturbing me, but it is called for others beyond those things. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: I liked this, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It should not be taken seriously, and if that is the way it is actually quoit enjoyable. Fans of these movies should give this a look and those who like the Sci-Fi Creature features can also find some nice stuff here. <br /> <br /> Rating R: Graphic language, violence and some graphic carcasses
