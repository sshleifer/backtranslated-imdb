Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and picked up in high school. A group of children played several pranks on him, and these pranks were really bad. The last prank ended tragically. <br /> <br /> cue to 5 years later. The children of children meet again for a reunion. One of them set it up at the old high school. The school is now abandoned and they must break in. For some reason, the guard is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying and looking at their old lockers, and they see some of Marty's. A girl feels sorry about Marty, but another guy calms her. <br /> <br /> When the killings begin, it's good. All kills are creative and gory. We see a figure in an iron mask that chases them one by one throughout the school. It looks like Marty is back to exact revenge. After the first person is killed, they find out that they are locked in school. They start looking for a resort. <br /> <br /> There are a number of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion. Second, after the first child dies, a girl gets blood all over her. They all run into panic, but she runs the toilet and finds a bathtub. Her friend has just been killed and she decides to take a bath! More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom. Anyway, the bath doesn't really seem to work .... and she dies a horrible death, it's an 80's movie. It's a scary slasher. HOW TO USE if it has some illogical parts. I for one do not. This movie has really big deaths. The end .... there's a twist. Recently, I've seen Haute Excitement, I can compare the two. The only way they look is that there is a twist, which kind of left me disappointed ..... IT just after the twist comes a big, if not the best, killer in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the last killing, the killer looks at the screen and also does something wild and it was the perfect way to finish the movie. It has me going "wow ..."
