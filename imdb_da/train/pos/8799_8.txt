The movie is great, just like any other international project that has strong impressions. three of them (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) should have been cut out. especially Bosnian clip, which is pathetic beyond any reason, and does not contain a single original thought or element on its own. everything else is really good, unrecognizable to most Americans known to the rest of the world. Unfortunately clips talk about the misery of the people all over the world. and as I see it, there are so many of them that will not confuse it ... <br /> <br /> top 5: 1. loach 2. pen 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5. Imamura
