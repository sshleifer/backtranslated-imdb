Appeal of old movies like this is that you get to see a real moving picture of life over 100 years ago. Here are many people who leave a factory, all are dead now, and none of them are even far aware of the scope of the invention that they go before. I was shocked to read a reviewer calling this movie as boring as home movies today, and at least another mistakenly identified it as the first movie ever made (it was the first movie made at a speed of 16 frames per second in instead of then-normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all you see is a lot of people sending out of a building and passing the cinematographer on their way home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons, not least of which is that it was the first film made by the brothers Lumi√©re, which probably had a stronger influence on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
