Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes really) duel not only for Debra Wing's minds, but really over a secret from their childhood that gave them odds over their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic features (the fire department acts as a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the way that American werewolf in London used every big wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~, and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) and put his own trailer a rockin ' to 'She is a lady' priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing from the quote btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you'll never go back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the United States) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3, don't put yourself off ~ give it a try :)
