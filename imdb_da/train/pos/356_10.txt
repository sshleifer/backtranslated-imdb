It turned out to be a classic production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axle dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leaders, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much / not enough), which meant it wasn't too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a good step from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of history and production. They have a fantastic website that is worth checking out. Can't wait for Path if the improvement level continues, it should be great.
