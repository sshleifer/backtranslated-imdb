For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this movie will surely impress you, because of how honestly an adaptation is. With the exception of a smaller subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost deadly recreation of the book (down to the last line). For those of you who haven't read the novel, this movie can be a little tricky. It's certainly not a big movie story. Instead, it has a strong element of realism for it, but I didn't want it in any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey on film fans would be to say that it is a small scale Hindu version of 'Fiddler On the Roof'. Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman, the protagonist is Gustad Noble banker in 1970's Bombay during the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved in some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. Ending is not a happy one, nor is it sad, but it is essentially what realism entails. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a nice little movie, but if you want to see it, good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little publication.
