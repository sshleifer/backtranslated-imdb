Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the better Poirot books, as it is very scary and has a brilliant end. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with some nice photography and a very joking music score. As always, David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comical highlight of the episode is Poirot's fight with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but be careful not to overshadow the two leads, a danger in some Christie adjustments. Part of the episode was pretty scary, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that I enjoyed much more than this. What made it especially unpleasant to put the music aside was when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About the adaptation, it was pretty faith in the book, but I would say that there were three things I did not like. The main problem was pacing, it's pretty slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I also didn't like that they made Joseph Mercado a killer. In the book I see him as a rather nervous character, but the interference from the idea of ​​making him a murderer and underdeveloped it made him a less appealing sign, although I am glad that they did not miss their drug abuse. (I also noticed that the authors ruled out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she thinks she is the killer's next victim.) The other, which was not so impressive, was that I felt it could have been more effective if the adaptation had been in Amy Leatheran's view, as if it were in the book, Amy seemed somehow less sensitive in the adaptation. Despite some misjudgements on behalf of the author, I liked to murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
