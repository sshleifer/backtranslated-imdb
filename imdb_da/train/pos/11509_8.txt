It is a real shame that this spin-off TV series inspired by the superior television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only for a single season and twenty episodes because this program at best offered an often-winning and highly entertaining mix of sharp cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's spiritual verbal sparring with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo was always a treat to see and hear), cleverly written, nifty supernatural threats (to love the evil and original creatures in "The Spice Moss Murders", "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights", plus you can't go wrong with such tried-and-play scary favorites like zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches), colorful characters lively plays from a cool cool guest stars (legendary biker girl icon William Smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in "The Energy Eater", while other episodes included major veteran characters such as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Deh down, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), real moments with real excitement (the sewage climate of "The Spanish Moss Murders" was extremely hard) and the best of all the only Darren McGavin is in the highest form like the brash, aggressive and exciting but basically decent, brave and honest little-time Chicago, Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the supreme 70's everyman protagonist, a greasy and fast-knit guy with a strong nose to a tasty scoop and an unlucky sound to get into any kind of trouble. Moreover, the occasional bumbling Kolchak was anything but superhuman; He either stumbled or stumbled as they ran away from a deadly threat, but had some inner strength and courage that enabled him to save mankind time and again from all kinds of mortal World War II. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of fun secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronically poor boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the splendid Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic foil, Ruth McDevitt was simply lovely as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol Ann Susi was also very fun as an avid guru Monique Marmelstein (who nevertheless disappeared after popping up in only three episodes). The evidence showed that the show suffers from sharp makeup and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in "The Werewolf" unfortunately looks like a Yorkshire terrier!) And the latter episodes boasted a few ridiculously stupid monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "Chopper", Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in "The Youth Killer"), but even the second largest shows are redeemed by the program's trademark, wicked blunt Sardinian white and McGavin's infinite vitality and engaging scrappy presence.
