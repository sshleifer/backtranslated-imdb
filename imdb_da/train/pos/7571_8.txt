This game goes above and beyond. I had the honor of playing my on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice effect was above standard. The severity is just right. Wesker, in my opinion, must be the best grades in the RE series. The story amazed me and took many different twists that I had not expected. The only rating this game deserves is fantastic.
