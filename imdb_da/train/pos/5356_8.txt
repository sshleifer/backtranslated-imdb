Running Man is not a good movie, it is actually a little silly. But it delivers what you want in an Arnie movie, and it's action and entertainment. I can't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and over the top that it almost makes fun of itself. This is probably one of the most quoted Arnie films out there.
