I have loved all of Creams work, though there is such a small and precious catalog of work to address. Even when they go as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples), the socks still suck out more than half of a given rock action that works today. This power of gel on stage has been given one of the most anticipated rock band reunions ever with their Royal Albert Hall shows last year. They may have grown older, just like their fans, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own. The releases of the White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love do not seem to miss a blow. Clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes does not have when he is on stage with his solar band. Ginger Baker said enough. Jack Bruce is robust enough with his vocals still with some kind of power that Clapton could never get on his own. Bottom line, if you want to see what was the best you wanted last year (yes, some might have seen them), this is all on this DVD with great special features.
