Not only is this movie entertaining, with excellent comedic acting, but also interesting politically. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but it makes fun of Soviet mentalities through and through. The story is set during the early days of the Soviet Union, and it questions the background of the revolution in both cultural and practical terms. Even in the late 80s and early 90s, the bizarre strings of Soviet societies are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and well and ready for a well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a fun and entertaining package! Jur
