It is written in stone that Disney animations should simply be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be much more fun for ~ not ~ containing the hokey-five-year standard Disney musical fare. <br /> <br /> While history was not as encouraging as it could have been, it was still quite good, fun and adventurous. I had hoped for a little more, yes, considering the subject, but this movie is ~ not the bitter disappointment or complete failure it has been billed to be. <br /> <br /> The animation quality is average, but the dialogue is pretty convincing, just like the story line, plot, subplot and great creativity I found within this production. I will refrain from describing the plot as it is done and done, but this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of imagination. This is in my opinion the best Disney Animated Feature Length Movie. <br /> <br /> It bets a 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
