The story and the characters were some of the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for PS and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. I felt the problems faced by the protagonist were credible and realistic, and I think it deserves a successor. or at least a remake. If they remade it to ps3 I would buy the system for that particular game and maybe mgs4 it's also great idea and the performance of the dragoon system is enough to justify a rental and on top of the ad inventive though sometimes cheating (Stupid Buster Wand) Battle addition system and the plot makes this game a particular purchase.
