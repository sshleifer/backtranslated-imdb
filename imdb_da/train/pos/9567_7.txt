I watched the DVD of this movie, which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems to be in Cambodia (the subtitles in English say the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia). A very vicious man raises boys to be killers who use hunger and train them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a policeman is killed. Cop Wai is a loose cannon worried about his father, who is also a policeman who was shot and coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and is worried about Wai's irregular behavior. He doesn't know Wai was the one who got his father to treat drug dealers and shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a dirty landfill where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and continues to repeat her father, not to let her go. (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand it, but saves her from her father who seems to have sex with her maybe that's the cause of cat III). Wai is getting more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to her home where they are married, she becomes pregnant. Wai follows and joins the evil man (who trains the boys) who makes a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang. There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman, the great victim and leaving the Wai Dead, and Pang carries out his child from the dead mother to die and leave him as the possible next boy to arise as a murderer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman had a long nail pulled out of her foot. Knives for neck and torso. Guns fired straight to the head. And several very intense blows. It may be gloomy and unobtrusive, but it is definitely worth seeing.
