Preston Waters is out for a bad summer. Besides his birthday coming up, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First, he has to share his own room with his brothers who are doing business. They can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space. At a birthday party, he only receives $ 6 tokens, while others receive $ 32, $ 35, and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards comes early, he only gets a check out for $ 11. <br /> <br /> He goes to the bank and learns he needs at least $ 200 to start an account. Abandonment of the bank steals the check. Pursue after the baby almost makes him run over (definitely his bike gets destroyed) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley is right from the bank also to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow. Quigley starts writing a check for the damage, but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area. Scared, he gives Preston the check, informs him to give it to his father to finish. <br /> <br /> That night, Preston says his father doesn't want a new bike, he wants his own room back, even better his own house. His father limits him to his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston figures things can't get worse, he realizes he's forgotten the control as it is still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> With the computer and after careful consideration he makes it $ 1,000,000. The next day, when he tries to pay it at the bank, he is taken to the owner, who thinks he is the one he should give $ 1,000,000 and do. He is not, however, as the right person named Juice comes a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now, the three will track down Preston. <br /> <br /> However, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things including his own house and even goes on dates with a spoiled bank lady who is real and FBI agent (who tries to track down the 3 evil guys) . He makes this person up with the name Mr. Macintosh that he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, things get going (money runs out, the bad ones get him). <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful fun flick. Miguel Ferrer plays his part very well. If you enjoyed him in another Stakeout, you'll love him here. He does all sorts of evil things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed chief of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
