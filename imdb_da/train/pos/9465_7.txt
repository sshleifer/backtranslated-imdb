Steve Carell again stars in a light romantic film about choice, family and pressure. Judging from the plot and covering art from the film, I expected a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light drama to me, and Steve Carell again gave a good performance. The movie itself really handles true observations, and it was a strong element I found. But the ending felt a little hasty and predictable. Throughout, the cinematography was great, the play was fantastic, and the message it delivered was obvious, yet very important. But it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. I would expect if different choices were made at the end of the movie (maybe too bad though) this movie would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.
