I love the series! Many of the stereotypes depicting Southerrners as hicks are very clear, but such people exist too often. The Southern Government's depictions are all too true, but the sympathetic characters also remind one of the many good things in the South. Some things never change and we see the "good old boys" every day! There is a Lucas Buck in every southern city that has to call only to make things happen, and the history of "po" white waste is far too familiar. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else could be very good in modern South! I think somehow Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
