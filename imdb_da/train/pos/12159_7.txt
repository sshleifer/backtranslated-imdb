- After their sons have been sentenced to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to receive threatening phone calls because someone falls off their sons. The couple decides to move to California to escape the trial and to start a new life. They start a dance school that will soon be very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father, with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becomes a bit too fake with an evangelist on the radio. It is only time-wise before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can't help comparing What is Helen's case? to the one who beat Aunt Roo ?, also starring Shelly Winters. Where that movie seemed almost detained in his presentation of Aunt Roos madness, there is nothing that keeps Helen back in this movie. It can take quite a bit of the movie's running time, but when she snaps, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You don't want to mess with her. The winters are so demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. I don't want to ruin the movie, but the things Helen can do are completely over-the-top. <br /> <br /> - Almost Winters, Reynolds is quite ridiculous in its role as the gold-popping tap dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would nominate her for a prize. This is not Citizen Kane! Finish by acting so seriously. Hi, Debbie, you do not realize that you are the main purpose of being the victim of winter madness. <br /> <br /> - I just love these former female stars at dusk - of-their-career horror movie. What is Helen's case? is just as fun as anyone.
