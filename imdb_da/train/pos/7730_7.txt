If in the 90s you adapt a book written in the 50s, put the bloody stuff in the 50s and not the '90s. Look, 40 year old moms and values ​​tend not to play as well, or ring so true, so far down the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood usually keeps violating. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been put in the era it was written in. You would think it would be a no-brainer, but no. I would elaborate, but bmacv's commentary tells it quite well. I will restrict my comment to Rachel Ward. She looks like she slipped her ass out of the existence of this role. As a result, she looks like a crack ho on chemotherapy, and is as sexy as a gay leather sofa in a row. I found her "I could die at any time" looks pretty confusing, and it greatly detracted from her supposed "hotness" and "sexual tension" the film intended to create. Apart from that, the movie was pretty good; a 7+ out of 10.
