I couldn't believe the comments about the movie. <br /> <br /> When I read the horrible opinions about the movie, I actually wondered if you had actually seen the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and the director did a great job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I hadn't had the pleasure of seeing either the actress before, and I couldn't have been more drawn off by the incredible work they were supposed to say to me the most credible movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> What I can't see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of substance in attempts at the suicide scene. From the comments you sounded like it was the actresses' choice and her stupid choice. That I do not understand, it is a movie written by another and directed by someone else, so how it may be the actress error I cannot see. I think it was a really credible movie that I would look again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and it is so bad that so many are so close. I hope to see some of the actors soon I think everyone played big roles. Occupied Philipps becomes the highest paid actress one day, and I hope she can laugh at the face of anyone who criticized her! Well done!
