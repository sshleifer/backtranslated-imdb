In the classic sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of fun or even entertainment), Altmans is "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all humours, and indeed in very fun, entertaining ways. There is phlegm, which personified by Lauren Bacall's very slowly guarded and protective character Esther Brill, a mission in life, seems to be all about appearance and protects her age and beauty secrets more than her well-being. There is Paul Dooley's Choleric Dr. Gil Gainey, who likes a fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal) flops around frantically, barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. Melancholy by Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell tastes of Shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous Hamlet - even providing a soliloquy or two. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's bile character, Bobby Hammer ("The Breast Feeding the Child, Determines the World"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett respectively), relatively true characters who strive to find some kind of balance among all companions and extreme moods that have called for H.E.L.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which is other than health. This is Altman in his classic best.
