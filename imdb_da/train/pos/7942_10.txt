Giallo fans, search for this rare movie. It is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low life hazards that fill these movies. I don't want to give anything away, so I don't even want to say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this movie in English is from European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
