I thought racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear was grossly over-razed to the Hollywood effect. I don't think U.S. Navy was ever overtly racist. I can't imagine a full captain, the commander who has ever told his boss to deliberately flunk someone. Certainly not at risk for his life. And there has never been a Chief Petty Officer as unnoticed prejudice for all but WASPs as DeNiro's character. No boss like blunt and drunken as he became the game would ever have risen to the chief of the ranks in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise badly made movie.
