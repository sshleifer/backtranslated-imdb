mahatma gandhi, father of the nation in his quest for India's freedom struggle ignored his own family and son, this film is about his son hiralal, who feels neglected because of mahatma gandhi's service to society. The film starts in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fights for India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a barrister, when gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, he also wanted his wife and children to participate as a service to the community, and hence hirarlal did not get the chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal aspires to travel to England and become barrister like his father, but his own father refuses to give him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it to another person who says the scholarship should not be confined to his family and should be open to the most deserved student living in the colony. These angers hiralal and the shift between father and son increase, hirarlal hates his father to neglect him and accuses him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and land on the streets through unsuccessful business attempts and in great debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has a fantastic performance like Hiralal Gandhi .. all kudos to him, the direction and the script are great, the imagery is excellent. overall an excellent movie and a must see. I give it a 10/10
