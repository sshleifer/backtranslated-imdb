Having seen 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at the release party, I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. I had a couple of direct stomach pains, and some of the comedians (especially Eric Roberts) were a scream. I haven't heard words about the actual release date, even though I've heard it's close. The story is simple but is essentially a vehicle for signs and situations. The scripture is smooth and seamless, the plot develops effortlessly and the play is pleasant but fresh. This movie has won at least one prize from each of the film festivals it has been in, which is about 10-15 or so. I highly recommend 'Break a Leg'.
