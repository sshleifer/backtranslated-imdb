Ladislas Starewicz curiosity with insects and cinema meets in a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple story of a fake car couple, both seeking stimulation outside their marriage, resembles a biography or a short-time character. Starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires to straighten the legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story builds as Mr Beetle is unknowingly captured on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub of a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find her wife in her artist's arms, she shocks her around angry, but eventually forgives her and takes her out to watch a movie. But Mrs Beetle quickly learns about her husband's adultery, as the movie they see is the jealous grasshopper's footage by Mr. Beetle and dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle beats Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen and they both end up in jail after the projector, they break in fire. The insects are placed in humanized settings like a house or a night club and are given human characteristics of jealousy, anger, desire and revenge. The insects carry briefcases, drive vehicles, and even use shoes, but they also shake their antennas and open and close their mandibles as real insects would. The novelty of history does not carry itself, even after several views, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly. Action is done with intricate details, but quick and faster movie recording is lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early doll hat and is highly recommended.
