Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director / star collaboration between John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember many years ago that Fonda told him that as a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and afraid he wouldn't live up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before firing begins to put him in peace by saying he shouldn't play the big emancipator, but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer. It was decided Fonda led a throw, which John Ford instructed in a classic movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical movie from Lincoln. It was in the age of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey won the Pulitzer Prize win by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the final Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda didn't play the Great Emancipator, just a Illinois lawyer. The film includes about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him clerking in a department store, getting some legal books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in history. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaves Lincoln a most melancholy being. Fast forward for 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who is starting to get a message. He has made a few terms in the legislature, but he is back in private practice, not really sure if the policy is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of this family he had got the law books back from their way when they were charged with murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder, but a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The test itself is fiction, but the gambit used for the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the two sons, is based on a genuine case that Lincoln defended. I don't want to say more. <br /> <br /> Apart from the show, Young's great strength is Lincoln the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie city in a fourth of July celebrations. It's almost like you see a newsletter. And it was the country's atmosphere, young, alive and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford movies will recognize two musical themes that were repeated in later movies. During the romantic interlude in the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, the background music is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And by a dance, the tune Lovely Susan Brown is that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, who play Mary Todd, are the same as Fonda danced with Cathy Downs in My Darling Clementine on the dance upbringing of a Tombstone Church. <br /> <br /> For two reasons, Lincoln will forever be a favorite for movie theaters and dramatists, I think. The first is that he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from scratch to the height of power through their own efforts. In fact, young shows Mr. Lincoln very graphic background that Lincoln came from. And secondly, he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history, and that he made a unique good and moral decision to release slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some necessary political reasons. His murder assured his place in history. Besides Fonda and others, as I have mentioned, particular praise should also go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two districts, Kohler as murder victims and Bond's chief attorney. Also, Donald Meek as prosecutor and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last movie as pioneer Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters, who specialized in rustic characters like the judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures drama and romance of the time it's set, you can't do better than Young Mr Lincoln.
