How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them have already died. It reminds me of Dennis Leary joke about great musicians who die in kitchen fires while the useless live forever. I switch here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised children struggling against their repressive high school administration. These are extremely stupid things, but there is optimism about what is refreshing (though they chew up the building). Who knew this would actually be a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era where people still believed that music matters and that could make a difference to the larger community. It's full of kids who know the authority doesn't have the right answers. Instead, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, it's pure exploitation. Don't take it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what the primary school's life was in the seventies, then it should have been.
