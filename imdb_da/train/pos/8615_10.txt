I was waiting for this movie to come out for a while in Canada and when it finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, it is initially a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - make it even more sad) - it does stick with you. The next day I thought about it again, because although it is about such emotional drainage, you realize after a few days that it's such a beautiful story. How a person can be seen as a link to so many people, but sometimes you can blind so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them just by being there. And how they also save her in the process. It was such an excellent movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. It is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissue but will really stay with you for a long time.
