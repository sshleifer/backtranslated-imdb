Excellent movie dealing with an old man's life as he looks back over the years. Beginning around 1910, he reminds of his boy and young adulthood; his family, friends, romance, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale .... "All things in life come together as one, and a river runs through it. And that river mocks me." Worth to see.
