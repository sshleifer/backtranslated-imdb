Little Edie and Big Edie are signs that everyone can feel compassion for. Although their house was dirty, it is somehow understandable given their mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the ability to cope with an eight-year-old." This reminded me when in the dramatized 2009 version, Big Edie says to Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's only with you!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Perhaps, if Little Edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time, things didn't work out, lost her hair, her job and the love of her life, she would have done it. This somehow binds to what I think is her mental illness: Her inability to fetch herself when times are tough and see that good times are ahead. The world will never know what has happened if she did not listen to her mother's claim: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> But these understandably unsafe women somehow succeed in being brilliant, heartbreaking, and gracious, even in their extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other brings humor and grief. When Edie had one of her emotional breakdowns, housing about what could have been, or how she would get out of her home because she feels like a little girl, you get the intense urge to hug her and tell her that "everything will be okay!" <br /> <br /> Big documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
