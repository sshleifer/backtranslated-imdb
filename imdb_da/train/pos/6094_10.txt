These two stars are the only iconic heroes / villains, I know there is a good TV series, so let's compare. Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 additional movies (Robocop: Prime Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection) <br /> <br /> Freddy - 1 upcoming movie Robocop - 1 upcoming movie <br /> <br /> Who has had more screen time? Now they both have 7 films, 1 TV series and 1 upcoming movie. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) and 17-18 TV episodes. Since this is a comment on the series between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The series I would personally choose Robocop ...
