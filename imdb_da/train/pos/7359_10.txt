where would you start a review of the movie Snitch'd? James Cahill, God resting his soul, made one of the most bold insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels about a drug squad policeman McClure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said the policeman deep into the underworld, who is high school, and discovers a band war to compete with the police academy 1, and I mean where Jones is furiously lost by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you ever will hear. <br /> <br /> Cahill's understanding of effects, both visual and sound reproduction, is electrifying, the small break between action on the screen and the speakers adds the snitch'd drama, a real gritty as underground thriller. Also kudos for his brilliant use of makeup as the overall convincing brand names, a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor grill! YUCK! I feel the movie's world is much smaller from James's passing, his memory will continue to turn on and off again, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd. his insight director's comment released a cookie jacket on the nose of any discerning movie-goers, really appropriate with the harsh reality of street life caught in all the beauty of a coarse punk knocking over a bin in a fight. br /> <br /> But I ask you, why did the big bosses look swimming pool so cheaply? I will tell you why, because it is the life of Santa Ana baby, it is not all drives city and hastily constructed principle offices, oh no. There are some folk music to infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in LA to break through in movements that don't seem to be out of place at a special children's production of Double Dragon: The Play. <br /> The only nuisance I have with this movie is that there was never a successor. Come on Steven Spielberg, come on George Lucas, come on guy who claimed nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to get it cut it up and pay tribute to this great man, James Cahill. <br /> <he discovered Eva Longoria, you know. Oh yes, he did. <br /> <br /> Jonah
