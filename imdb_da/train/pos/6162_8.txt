I loved this masterpiece and frankly I also found Mary Poppins (though I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be stupid and sacrine-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I don't know why people think of this movie as distorted. It was magical and it was very fun to watch. Each scene had some charm when you got to know the characters better. You really see how this little thrown together family learns to bind to each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well-developed, especially Charles, who was on "Age of not Believing". Mary Poppins can be more popular and appreciated by others, but this little gem will be the one I will always love and appreciate.
