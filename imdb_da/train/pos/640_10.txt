I and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good we were glued to it all. hahaha .. i think i'm hooked for the season !! .... they have some really good actors in this thing .. head coach guy and player who likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me, but i don't really understand how they will keep it stretched for a whole season .. there will probably be some big twist tho .. i can't wait till Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumps who is he? I can tell he will be great !! he was so good we fell in love with his character right away .. can't wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
