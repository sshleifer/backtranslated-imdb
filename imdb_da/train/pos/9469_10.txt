The answer to one of the tracks is Murphy's law: Everything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is precisely the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Office) a column store for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in giving advice to everyday life, but he will realize that things are not so perfect in themselves. Dan in Real Life is great at capturing these irons of everyday life and is successful in embracing their comedy, tragedy and beauty.
