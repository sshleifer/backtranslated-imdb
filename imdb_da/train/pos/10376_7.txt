I just looked at Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, I actually found myself worried about what is happening to Matt throughout the film, which in itself is very fun, very pacey with a good mix of well-rounded characters, right a performance considering that is shorter time. There are also plenty of good phrases throughout, it will keep you guessing at the end. Other characters to watch out for are the totally crazy Tiny and the creepy attractive Jesse. It may not have the big budget for a Hollywood blockbuster, but don't let that put you off, you can do much worse than checking this out, you won't regret it. Good fun. 10.7
