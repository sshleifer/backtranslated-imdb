After carpeting his toes in the Giallo pool with the masterful film "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed that year with what turns out to be another angry thriller: "Scorpion's Case Hale. " Like his previous efforts, this is a star-looking macho guy George Hilton who would continue to star in Martino's Satanic / giallo hybrid "All the Colors of the Dark" the following year. "Scorpion's Tail" also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who wanted to exhibit an unhappy couple (to say the least!) In Martino's "Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only in the Key" (1972). (I just love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot this! Nevertheless, this movie boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans expect, as well as a twisted plot, some finely crafted killer sets, and beautiful Athenian placement footage. The story this time is about an insurance researcher (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here is similar to Farrah Fawcett's more beautiful and smarter sister), who gets involved in a series of pig murders after a plane crash and the $ 1 million legacy of a beautiful widow. I really thought I had found this image halfway through, but I was dead wrong. Although the plot makes perfect sense in this giallo, I may have to watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its features. The highlights of the picture were for me Anita's cat-and-mouse game with the killer at the end, a particularly intriguing house burglary and a beautiful match on a tiled roof; lots of good action outbursts in this movie! The fine people at No Shame must be thanked for another great DVD, with good subtitles and interesting extras. Whotta great outfit it turned out to be in his continued quest to bring these lost Italian gems back from oblivion.
