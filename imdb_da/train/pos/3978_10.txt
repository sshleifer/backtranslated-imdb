I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Way Home", which has come across information on American drug culture spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I found him to be an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching movie clips from the hippie era and the 70-year-old stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. The one who composed it was certainly in contact with the melodies of each era. Hopefully they pack them and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960s experiments with LSD changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was the mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who was responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine that entered this country in the 60s and 80s.
