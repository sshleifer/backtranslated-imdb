With this subject it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job of making Gerald a real person, a person you worry deeply about, and as a result, you feel like his situation is trying to live both Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine sees him HOT! And the chain between him and Julie Walters is electric. There are two signs that feel love to each other and it comes through even when they just look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is credible and you find yourself cheering at the end! At least I did it!
