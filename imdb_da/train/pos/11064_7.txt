"I take you there" tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in blind time. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly situational comedy with Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance. A kind of flight flicker with many fun and some exciting moments keeps moving, remains fresh and is a worthy watch for indie lovers.
