This is an irresistible great cheerful and technically made movie! <br /> <br /> The movie features some of the best looks you'll ever see in a 30 movie, though it's all too obvious they are set, rather than real place locations. Often, if a sign would fall or shake a door post for aggressive, the whole sentence would naturally move. <br /> <br /> The best moments in the movie were the silent, more old-fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. It shows that René Clair's true heart was in silent film making. The overall humor is really great in this movie. The musical moments were, of course, more than great. This is a really comfortable light and simple comfortable early French musical. Although the best moments are the silent moments, it does not mean that the film is not filled with a great humorous dialogue that is very well delivered by the main actors, who all acted as stage actors to me, who in this case worked extremely well for the film its overall style and comfortable, no worries atmosphere. No wonder it was so good, as this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr. It is a technically very good movie with also a great innovation camera work in it and some really good editing that creates something quick and comfortable to see cozy sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart instructor who knew how to build and plan comic moments in film. It is a very creative film that, despite its simplicity, still feels like a completely original and wisely constructed film that never intervenes. The last half hour is especially unforgettable fun without destroying too much and is really among the greatest and most creative moments in the early comedy film production. The movie is filled with some really funny characters, which of course are very stereotypical and stupid and were obviously thrown out because of their appearance. It all adds to the pleasant light comic atmosphere and cuteness of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
