Be that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities, I think it should have more credit than it has been given on imdb. It is your basic "who has done it?" thriller with sex and murder, but it keeps you guessing right to the end. I like these kind of movies, and I certainly think this one meets the standard. <br /> <br /> For me it was worth seeing more than once, so I give it an 8 on imdb.
