This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you simply have to see it yourself: You want to Don't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this as a child in the 80s (with Swedish voices). I've talked to a few people who were also kids in the 80s and they loved it too! I have to admit that the education part of the episodes did not come through to me at a deliberate level, but the whole idea of ​​educating children while having fun is wonderful. I have recently seen a few episodes; There is a humor and a heart in what is hard to find in other children's programs today. <br /> <br /> 5/5
