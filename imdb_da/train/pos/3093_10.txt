Why did the producers not give it a chance? Of all the junk on television, why did the producers not give six degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I would love to see how it ends. Put season one on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited to get it back. I tuned my recorder to tie all the shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and I'm heartbroken. I wish I knew it would be canceled, why didn't they tell us? I thought the show just developed a depth of the characters. The script was also quite good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all time favorite. I'm so sorry to see it go!
