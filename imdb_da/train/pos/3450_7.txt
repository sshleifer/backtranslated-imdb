Have never heard of this movie before I saw the rental price, I'm a little skeptical, there have been many movies in the past with good ensemblecasts that can't make any movie into a bad script and in some cases don't seem to care. <br /> <br /> Having just seen it was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release, that's good. The story that most in this genre may seem a little forced at times, but there also seems to be a good amount of realism here that also offers the opportunity to carry. I was pleasantly surprised at how well a job Justin Timberlake is doing here with such a big role, OK, he's not an Oscar yet, but he learns with every role and he shows a great promise of the future here. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good in his unexpectedly scary role and is definitely the flow of the crop in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end just give it a try. You will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact I think you will be more than satisfied with the end result.
