Probably Bigas Luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in buff, is the subject of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suck them and also suck his own mother's breasts. His pursuit of May is the movie. As in Luna seems like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly combed sexual sensation to his strange but beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open mind will enjoy this scary erotic poem for the female breast. José Luis Alcéne's photos are beautiful and Nicola Piovani's scores are sweet and rich. A beautiful cinematic confectionery with a nice anarchic feel that Spanish does it naturally.
