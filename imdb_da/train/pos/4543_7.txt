Well no, I'm telling a lie, this is actually not the best movie all the time, but it's a really entertaining movie that no one I know has seen. It's a comedian movie with Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) with a little fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter. The reason why this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leaders who did not like and mistrust each other, but in a shocking fate end up being friends. The whole cultural difference is done quite well, because it's fun to see, it's quite ridiculous, but in a cheesy and fun way. The soundtrack is cool, once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way it suits the movie, I have tried to find one of the songs of the age, but as I work from the memory of what I think a few of the words I was can't seem to find it. <br /> <br /> Another thing this movie has is the most amazing payout of any movie ever, but I don't want to give it away, oh no! In conclusion, I will take this movie over 48 hours most of Eddie Murphy's production, including Beverly Hills policeman, and regardless of buddy junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have their names. If you're looking for a buddy movie and get tired of "straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop", this gives a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised, as it changes the whole formula upside down with "just Japanese policeman meeting zany streetwise white cop". I'm giving this 7. I'm honest, I like it more than that. I'd rather see this than a lot of things I would give 8. But I think I know deep down that it's a kind of mental illness that makes me like this movie.
