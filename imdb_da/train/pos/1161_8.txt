It was extremely low budget (some scenes seem to be recorded with a home video recorder). But it has a good plot line and it is easy to follow. 8 years after shooting his sexual abuse, father Amanda has been released from the psychiatric ward by her doctor, whom she secretly has an affair with. The doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the film, Amanda kills him and bury him in her backyard. Then she sees her neighbor Richard put his eyes on him and stop nothing until she has him. She seems innocent, but after another neighbor, Buzz finds out that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to kill Richard's wife Laurie (it's after Amanda and he gets it in the hot tub). Then she stops acting so innocently and kills Buzz and later tries to kill Richard, whom she apparently loves and cares for. And you have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Overall good movie reminds me a lot of my life, you know it all falls to the neighbor and stops nothing before you get him to participate.
