Compares with Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way that never was done before. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is very confusing, you choose more each time you see it (I've been to the cinema to watch it 3 times now)
