The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! Mysteries are waiting to be resolved and very good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories of the characters! Explains just enough to be excited! Of course, this show has some errors! In the first two series there are some signs that for some reason do not come up in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent dispatch, but some of them are just not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they'll come back in later episodes! But it is a little inconsistent! To be said "Lost" manages to be exciting every episode (especially the first two seasons)! It's a very difficult thing to do! I note that in the third season, focus is more on character development than mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end I would like to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure! The danger of "Lost" being canceled due to falling ratings is near! And it would be devastating!
