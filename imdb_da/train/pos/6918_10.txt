A very entertaining film containing characters that do bad things and which leave feelings like anger and a desire for revenge bubble. Cast is very good, there's lots of action, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) in the end. I've watched this movie several times and always watch when it is on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
