Yes, it's a chicken and it's a little slow, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a male man. You must love Judy Davis, whatever she is in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural and convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The landscape of the small coastal location is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the movie. The unknown (least unknown to me) actors and actresses make a realism for the film that draws you in and keeps your attention. Overall, I give it an 8/10. Go see it.
