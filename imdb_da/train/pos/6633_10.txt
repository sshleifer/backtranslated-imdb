The first movie ever made. Workers flow from a factory, some bicycles most go, move to the right or left. Together with Melies, Lumieres is both the starting point and the starting point for the cinema - with Melies starting narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artwork, acting; with Lumieres clean, unspoiled, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the transformation of the cinema from the latter to the formerly tired formulas. <br /> <br /> But consider this card again. There is nothing "objective" about it. The movie is full of action - a static, inhumane scene breaks into life, activity, and the tranquil harmony of the frame breaks, decentered from the back to the right or left (but never of course the front where the camera is). And yet the camera still stands still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematographer can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - mapping the world, editing it, limiting it, limiting it. <br /> <br /> The movie's historical reality is worse. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses spy on their workers, the unseen eye with regard to his faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, workers are restricted in their workplace. The gate opening seems to be a picture of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall that further limits them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, a picture of invisible, all-seeing authority that captures its servants. A scary, overly prophetic movie.
