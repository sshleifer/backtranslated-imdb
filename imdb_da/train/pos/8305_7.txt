I really enjoyed the movie, but I didn't understand that Little Richard had so many things in his life. First of all, I wasn't aware of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of women who are closely involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of women in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the film was great. I also didn't like Leon playing that part of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that part of should have been to another actor. Visually, he didn't remind me of Little Richard. I was also totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the film he was depicted as a sex addict. In today's time, he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I don't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen the movie, but there were several things about the movie that I think shouldn't have been part of the final cut.
