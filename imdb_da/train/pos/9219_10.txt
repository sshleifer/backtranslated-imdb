The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was extremely fun. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. The parents are hilarious.They are catering companies as well as enemies. The children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church's play.They fall in love and their parents try to keep them separate. (Spoiler in the future I think) They slip off after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they will still be married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and the pollution of classical literature do not see. If you don't mind them, you will have a blast to see this.
