If you went to this movie to see some great academic presentations ... oh .. but if you wanted to see a fun nice adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it .. Jim Carey was amazing as usual. The story line was great, a few parts added as Grinch's story made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a blow. But even though there were a few SELECT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a child or family show. Don't try to lose it. If you really don't want to enjoy the movie ... and about the comments about Ron Howard, try to fix a big movie and see how you do it. It's not easy as it looks ...
