I suppose I had always noticed that the Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera was just too effortless and easy to have been filmed on the spot. But no problem - it is still a very underestimated lovely composition by Marcel Carne. The reason sometimes seems a little choppy as if they were doing it up while walking together, but because it is unpredictable, the attention is on the bitter end. The money shots, when the two lovers are alone in their room, are saddled with a rather straightforward dialogue, but it is so wonderful to fall into any kind of inanimate can be accepted. Are these 2 young symbols a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war France or simply idiots? Suicides are quite common; If the suicides are young and healthy with their lives before them untouched, would you think of anything other than that they were just deceived fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played the prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy anyway! I have only seen a few movies with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention of pimp in HDN - my problems are low: every time I see his face, I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A remarkably atmospheric, well-behaved and photographed movie with so much event, it takes a few impressions to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second movie had a little funny role as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
