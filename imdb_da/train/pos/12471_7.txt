I didn't know the real events when I sat down to see this, just the fact that this was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda tries to help his daughter Desiree (... I didn't know anyone actually called their offspring who) coped with the loss. This is really made for kids, as is often the case with "family" flicks (with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for viewing, although I would keep teenagers out of it unless you are sure they are comes to buy the concept), but it does not break down the sting that a parent is dead and it does not really speak down to anyone. The reason is sufficiently interesting and moves well enough. The action varies, with the excellent Burstyn setting out most of her cast, Mathis follows it quite well, and Ferland and her peers (with a few exceptions) are the least convincing of the pile (and frankly they are annoying, so again, I'm not right in the intended audience for this thing). Editing and filmography are standard and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of entertaining lines or the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 10.7
