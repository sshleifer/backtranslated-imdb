The first part of this infamous horror series shows that a woman is kidnapped by a gang of black-dressed men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. She is beaten violently, spun around in the chair endlessly, the fingernails have pulled, Animal types are thrown at her, boiling water is poured on her, and finally the eye's eye is dotted with a needle (really sick and nasty scene). Creating this unforgettable torture program attempted to make it as real as possible and for me it is the closest thing to a snus movie you can get without committing murder on tape. Of course, some of the special effects are pretty bad, but the idea of ​​making a snus is pretty cruel. I have also seen "Flowers of Meat and Blood" which is more gory and sadistic, but less disturbing. Still, this is a must-see for horror fans!
