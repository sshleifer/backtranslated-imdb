I really can't remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly a strange, like rubber sneak in a motorway accident. Everyone said the truth is alien to fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really don't understand how a fictitious account of this documentary will be released this year. How can you improve this? Auntie and cousin of Jackie Kennedy are moving away from the New York Society and hiding in the Hamptons. In the process they are recluses and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies." They would have stayed hidden if the city did not move to condemn the property for rubbish and the subsequent rescue of Jackie. This movie was made after the rescue. All in all, you couldn't help thinking, "How bad was it before?" It's a look at the high society from the darker side, and it's absolutely fascinating.
