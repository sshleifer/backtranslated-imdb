Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people". The underlying romance of the plot is mostly staggered by a much more interesting "cloth for wealth" tale. Although history's central line is somewhat rushed, in several screens it has a sense of; Get the "nitty gritty" out of the way, focusing on the key issues that make "office politics" and using the almost irrelevant scenes used exclusively for comics. But it seems so good, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very clever and plays well on the transatlantic relationship Pegg shares with his fellow stars and merges the cross between the high and the low-life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a story that, despite predictability, is a unique journey . The various characters in the film are well presented and casting is definitely a plus of the movie. Both the relationship between "Pegg and Huston" and "love hat" relationship between Pegg and Dunst seems so good in a story that for a better word is charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course sex appeal, shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and serves as a "bimbo" role too well. Its one of those movies where every little detail pays homage to a good job. From transsexual strippers to a fantastic soundtrack, it goes well with what can only be described as smart comedy.
