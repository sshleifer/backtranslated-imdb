I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger in the beginning when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she slipped, I thought it was a scary scene I would think that when you see it, your nerves come into your body to you because it makes you full of fright and your heart beats faster. I liked watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
