Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic film has a lot of effort in it, and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a Game of Death. This movie is excellent and a great Sci-Fi / action movie. I have always seen this movie and it must be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
