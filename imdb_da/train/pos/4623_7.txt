Despite its pretty quiet title, this is a light teenage drama. Unless you are an old coot, you will probably find it sympathetic. However, it is not so good to develop signs or situations evenly. When you see it, you get the feeling that you have driven back and forth in the kitchen, even though you have sat down and watched all the time. This is one of the movies that counts a lot for your characters and they are appealing enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many I know, but I've always wanted the fuzzy Maddie Corman. Teenagers get most of the screen time without many intrusions from the annoying adults. Is it just me or did most of the young men seem terrible?
