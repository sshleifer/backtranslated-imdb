Can't believe my eyes when you read a lot of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some giant dudes. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, fun, crazy, over-the-top violent, yet with least doing, and all the way energetic to the core. Loved every bit of it. Can't remember anything mad like this made for laughs and martial arts that show up. And now it's most important (at least to me): it's free for computers. When I see some Hollywood actors appear on the screen in modern high resolution and horrible high budget action "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any * beep * child can do it - You can adjust the wires to the body, add some sweet PC effects and put it in the action movie. Here it is different. I don't think there will be even a dozen physically advanced action stars around the world who can repeat the battle that takes place at the end of the movie or in "Chinese football" games. And it's just a small Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with English audio tracks is not a problem with this movie. It doesn't spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> Can't help mentioning a very nice theatrical game. Some of you assume don't like it. What concerns me - it's great. Look at the dragon's friend who speaks bravely to the criminals and suddenly gets a fist in his left side of the head. His face expression changes into something moody, and he comes up to the Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the threatening size of his mouth - it is almost from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for publishing classic Jackie Chan films. His modern is much weaker in my humble opinion and does not deserve much hype. A total of 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre. Thank you for your attention.
