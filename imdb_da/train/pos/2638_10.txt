One of the best movies for all ages. You can never look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra story this movie adds. Almost 40 years old I saw this with my wife and two sons after work tonight, and I have not laughed and enjoyed a movie so much for a long time. Take time and see it with the kids. It reminds you how Disney used to be when you were young.
