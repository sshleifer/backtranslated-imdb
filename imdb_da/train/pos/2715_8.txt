The Quod erat demonstrator was a brilliant television series and it was truly one of the very few to plan for! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording entities it would be much better than it did in 1982. I am eagerly waiting for it to be available on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it's true that it has something in common with other TV shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., which I'm a big fan By, QED had a much more intellectual quality to it. However, this did not lead to it - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show ran in the UK as Mastermind and it had some of the BBC feel it, but with better production values ​​than the BBC typically had at that time. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen-year-old boy when this series was originally running and had a lot too much to do in my life to make time for television. I remember my dear mother but call me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. is a boring loss, and if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would love to see it make a return.
