Here is another movie from the 80s that most people just don't know. This slow, quaint (Montana's loving shot is breathtaking and reminded me of Costner's latest "Open Range", as well as star Robert Duval), and emotionally satisfying movies are the perfect movie type to watch late one night when you can't sleep or lukewarm Sunday afternoon. Those with the right mood will be treated with a finely detailed and intimate look at a family's grief and how they come together again after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while she is hunting. The performances are all top notch and silent. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are pitches in their portrayals, as are all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who unfortunately has not made any of the notes since this except the first "Young Guns") gives us quiet, little glimpses in everyone's personal grief. We don't just see how death affects the younger brother or parents, but also the confused mid sister, the colorful uncle, his crazy wife, and the dead teenager's boyfriend. What we really come here is the rural mid-western response to "Ordinary People". There are also nuances of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in some of the stoic downhome Midwest morals of these depicted and also in the lovingly frightening shots of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic "tears-jerkers" in the era, and a good little find for you quality movie hunters out there.
