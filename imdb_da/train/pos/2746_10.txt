Imagine turning off the lights in your remote yard on a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometimes after midnight a car with light off inches up the driveway. Moments later a resident radiates a flashlight into your darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so scary is the setting: a farmer's farm ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's Noir movies, "In Cold Blood" presents a frightening story, especially in the first act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rainy roads. It's the marble thing. But there is no dream. The events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family and look for a tax of non-existent cash. Director Richard Brooks used the actual sites where the real events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! It gives a memorable and scary movie. <br /> <br /> Both leading actors are similar to the two murders of reality. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and tired of a bumblebee dreaming to find Cortez's buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth talking artist with an American smile. <br /> <br /> After their killing, the duo jumps to Mexico. Things go wrong here so they come back to the United States, steal cars, raise and generally miserable as they roam from place to place. But it is a fool's life, and the two crimes soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film are fascinating as the rain falls, tightens the rope, and everything we hear is a crushing heart. <br /> <br /> Even with its somewhat mundane mid-range, "In Called Blood" stages in nineteenth details, a real-life story still mesmerizes nearly half a century later. It's the setting that does it. Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night?
