Higher education is a blow to the face of those of us who have been in the closet for too long regardless of ethnic background. It is a subject most of us want to ignore, but we cannot afford whether there should be a real progressive change in the way we should embrace and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid, but the fact that the matter is, ignorance ranks highest in the world, and more continue to help it dominate our society. everyone involved in this movie has done a good job of showing what steps need to be taken to no longer make movies as higher learning.sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and it helps.
