Just finished watching this movie, which disturbs me a lot. Have also been to South Africa twice, around the time this movie is set. It's certainly hit hard and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but constant increase in pace hardly allows for a break and there are certainly few moments. <br /> <br /> Will Nigel Hawthorne never see the same again. He came across as a very twisted person, and I didn't find myself suffering any more every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Totally agree with Steve-thomps articulated and thoughtful comments.
