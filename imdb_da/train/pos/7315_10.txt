Classic, heavily influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched a career with both director Carpenter and star Curtis. The seemingly unstoppable killer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he starts stealing a local babysitter on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! The carpenter's frightening story and wise direction gives this film such a quiet good life that it must be seen that it really felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the daily surroundings of a small town district really creepy. Carpenters good times their excitement and his jolting shock to make them most effective, it is in itself an experience that few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is smart enough to give us some really peculiar young characters and a very scary villain to keep the excitement stronger. The highest kudos also goes to Carpenter's simple but scary unpleasant music score. In a way, Halloween is a great example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very good trip as gracious babysitter Laurie Strode, she is so good that she would continue to be in a number of other horror movies before breaking into bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasants make a perfect performance as Myer's doctor, who is desperate to catch him again. It is also good to support Cast Loomis, Soles, Castle and others. <br /> <br /> Like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never wastes and chills. It's a MUST for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** out of ****
