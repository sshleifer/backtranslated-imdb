Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to tell who's best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are amazing. They dance their souls out. It is a beautiful tale of inseparability in life and myth; the myth gets into everyday life. Dance becomes life and life is danced out. True people at the same time live their own lives and become another, acting those parts of lovers of old. The magic continues.
