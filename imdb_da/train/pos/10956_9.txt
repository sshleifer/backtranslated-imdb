For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity, you are actually the mindless. While the show contains its share of potty jokes, it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun on social issues, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. Just read some of her material a little more to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also love is that not everything is a punchline. For those who expect a formulated joke as friends (I love friends), you won't find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humor, which is more realistic. We don't go around in this world and have witty punchlines for all that, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> Don't take it as mindless humor because it's so much more than that.
