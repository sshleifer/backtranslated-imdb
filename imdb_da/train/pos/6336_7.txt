OK, so FX is not high budget. But this story is based on actual events. Nothing thrown together to make a few rich actors, even richer !! Like most movies based on books, there are somethings that just don't fit. Only a few people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a profanity that most people think it is! This movie is by no means related to TWISTER! Other than both films are about tornadoes. For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things to remember ... The actual "night of the twisters" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. Try to think about how far storm research has evolved during that time. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something else and says it's a small town.
