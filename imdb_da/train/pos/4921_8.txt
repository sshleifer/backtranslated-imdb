As a Streetcar Named Desire (also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen), Panic In The Streets shows a New Orleans, where its great claim of fame - Jazz's birthplace - does not even mention a mention. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and certainly went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor, he was really rather than just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in an unredited little role as a flashlight, but the film is rich in talent starting with Jack Palance (still paid as Walter Jack Palance) as the local Mr 'Big' followed side cast Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Just plus rock solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as a policeman who comes around to doc Widmark's point of view. It's a very rewarding movie more to be seen a bit. Catch it if you can.
