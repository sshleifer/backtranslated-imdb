I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not big, but it has many great elements. The lighting and the scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The action is bad, but not worse than you find on SyFy Channel. The music is pretty good and gore is good. It has the big leather face in the movie and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I saw the complete movie and while it was mostly predictable, it was still fun. The women are attractive enough, and the main actor does a good job of being embarrassing and scary. The film was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence is suitable for children 13 and over. There were no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10, and I think it's fair. I would see it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil being pretty scary.
