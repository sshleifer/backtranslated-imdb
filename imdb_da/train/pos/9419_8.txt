This Alec Guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of business and also a light eccentric character study. The pace is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling - on the floor type of fun, except perhaps the sound effects of the experiments. But it has its entertaining moments and it is very cool in performance. The big explosion segment is probably the most dangerous element. <br /> <br /> The Union's procedures are quite trivial, reminiscent of being quite a jacket; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic love of Guinness character. The political armaments actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as a heavy. I do not think this works as well as LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; But even the light Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
