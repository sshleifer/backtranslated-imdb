I was not a fan of watching this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass, I only tagged together to see Eva Longoria and laugh at Jason Biggs Antics. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was actually better than I expected, but not much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments I guess. The movie was, however, quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost haunting his former husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of stopping the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the support game (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs at a steady pace. I liked the movie only because it had a lot of laughs to keep me otherwise would have given this movie a lower rating. hey its a chick flick and i review this movie from a guy's persepctive okay, it would be more a fair fight if women reviewed this movie and gave thought to it.
