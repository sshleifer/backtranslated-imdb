Brazilian films often get more positive reviews than they actually deserve. Above all, Contra Todos (against all) (original title rejected by the producers: God against all) received very low grade point average GPA on this site. It seems to be completely rejected by female spectators as a whole. In fact, it's not that brutal. I mean what graphic violence is about. Its brutality is inherent, as it portrays, would be lumpy, I mean underdog citizens who actually have high-tech equipment that coldly performs murder orders in exchange for "grana grauda". Is this postmodern man? Is his / her only worried about a fast, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive pleat, between satiating meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian movie from 2004, so far. The shining editing style, Ã  la Godard, its curious soundtrack contracts, is more than effective overall cast and, above all, its original narrative with subtle, non-chronological hidden points, which are only expressed in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 mark.
