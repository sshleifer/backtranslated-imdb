Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read through the other comments before I looked so briefly. I have to say that I disagree with most negative comments or issues people have had with it. <br /> <br /> As a first time "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I like to see things that I can strive for, not necessarily from the pros, but know that people just get their feet soft as me. <br /> <br /> If it really is this is also from a first-timer that I read, I welcome the effort. Strange work then in that respect! There were some comments on the music. I thought it was pretty nice for the play. Some say it kind of drunk together for a while, but I found it created excitement without (us) necessarily paying attention to it, and when he pulled out the gun and the guitar started to break chords, it was as if we knew there was a train on the tracks, but realize it's right now in motion. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip / clip in there, but shi * happens. Will anyone see that Hugh's dirty shirt gets white (almost in the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind that movie! Give the child a break for God's sake! All in all, I think it was very well done. Only 2 things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning. Don't go up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera, and I would just have shown the splatter in the beginning for a snapshot so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it is not difficult to make a movie, it just takes time to learn how to do it, so it's time to actually do it, and then you should rather take more time to think about all the details you need to shoot before calling "post production time!" IMHO, it looks like director / author Ryan Jafri did his homework and if it really is his first report card, I would give him an "A". The rest of you report to the head office's office for a whuppin '.
