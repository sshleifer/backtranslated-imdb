A surprisingly complex and well-formulated study of "The First" serial killer in the Soviet Union. Seen in the days of the perestroke, this intense piece is brought to fruition by Stephen Reah's and Donald Sutherland's notions. <br /> <br /> This study of Cicatillo as a murderer is well-rounded and by hint of some of his behavior while out rightly shows others there is a subtlety that is convincing without being obviously graphic. Not for the faint of heart, but as it is the subject, is often disturbing, but it is necessary for the full development of the key participants in this fact-based story. <br /> <br /> HBO has given us an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece. It's in my Top 10 Must see list.
