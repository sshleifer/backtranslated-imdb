After losing Emmy to her performance as Mama Rose in the TV version of GYPSY, Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE FUNDS: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert specially recorded for Las Vegas HBO. Funds that have played live on stage since the 1970s show that she is still one of the most electrifying live artists in the company. From her opening number, Bette commands her scene with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called "I Look Good", where she turns out she has a way of joking that get other artists in this business when she tells herself through a number of musical choices. The part of the show where she greets burlesque goes a little too long, but she manages to incorporate her old Sophie Tucker jokes here to the great advantage (though she actually forgets a joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). Bette also treats us to "Rose's Turn" from GYPSY and the title melodies from her smash movie THE ROSE and a shameless plug to her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house down at the end with "Stay with Me, Baby" from THE ROSE and her only # 1 hit record, "Wind Under My Wings" from BEACHES. It is a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Means fans, it is a must.
