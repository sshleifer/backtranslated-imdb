Now it's been a long year, and I'm down to reviewing the last movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) was ranked second in the latest Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not do so well at the ticket office as it was too artistic for the joint film gamers, especially since MMFF is the season where many families go out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie not in Filipino or English played on the screen was pretty exciting. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very effective as a lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions required for the movie. There was also a young actor Rebecca Lusterio. She did a good job depicting Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy. I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future maybe venturing into other genres. I think the fact that this movie was in its local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera's shots in the movie were done very well. The scenery was made breathtaking, though I feel that if a little effort would have looked quite different. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, I feel that the authors could have some part of the minor characters' life in the film. I certainly won't rave over the story of this movie.
