One of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as I had hoped given the glowing reviews. The movie starts well enough where the jokes are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is less frequent than you would think for this era) and make non-fight dialogue sequences useful (for a Kung Fu movie this is a good compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of Jackie Chans Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at modern rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film, it takes a nosedive in the dark melodrama tragedy that I thought was unnecessary. The action is generally good, with a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight at the end with the higher guy who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. There is only 20 minutes of battle here, which is standard, but what annoys me is the obvious speed of the camera's frame. I get to film half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth edits, and then there is. It really goes away from the battles when it is so obvious that the footage is cluttered. <br /> <br /> Having said that, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion won't stop you and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes in your life reading this.
