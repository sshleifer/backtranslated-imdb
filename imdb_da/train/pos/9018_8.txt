In spite of the small key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries (the R-class in the states may not have helped - honestly, just because HBC uses the C word!), It is actually a fine job. The sentimentality occasionally threatens to stifle it, but it is overcome by playing the two leaders. It is easy to win plaudits just because you play a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter cannot quite capture the physical degradation of MND, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive completely compensates. In fact, almost all of her performance is accomplished through the eyes (and which eyes!). This is an intelligent ride from an actress who quickly regrets his English Rose reputation and emerges as a figure of some form. Prizes must surely follow, but nevertheless, for this fine performance. <br /> <br /> You feel that Branagh has never been the best on film (except possibly Hamlet, and his game was diluted by the great casting). Here, however, he topped his other appearances and hired a howling, unstable, ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety that he has not always shown and shows both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe in him, as much as we could not believe in him as Frankenstein, as the pastor of 'The Proposition', as a lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man', like Andrew in 'Peter's friends'. This is probably his best performance yet - so why couldn't he produce the goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks like a TV show, and without its stars, it probably won't match much. But it has been a pleasure to see this couple performing their socks like this, and I am eagerly awaiting them (though not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
