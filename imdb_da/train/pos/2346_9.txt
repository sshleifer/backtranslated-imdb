Very cute pilot. Show Series of Tim Burton's Better Movie ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & Chocolate Factory. The kinematics, the narrative, the music, the external sets all scream Tim Burton. There must be a connection or a strong influence, I just haven't researched enough to know where it is. As I have seen in forums, yes, Anna Friel plays a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Don't make me wrong, Anna Friel does a good job. Her character is very sweet and lovable, and you are easily attached to her. It's more of a distraction, I keep thinking "Why didn't they get Zooey Deschanel". <br /> <br /> Lee Pace does a great job as well. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and looked it up. Wonderfalls !!! Large, short-lived series from 2004. If you enjoy Pushing Daisies, rent Wonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation. .Hmmmm <br /> Loved seeing Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two underrated character actresses who never fail to bring it with their performances.
