Now this is one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's only role in 1931 divided into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a great stalwart cast that hams the game for all they are worth, especially Askey of course. Histrionics was provided by Linden Travers, melodramatic by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely night station, find more than they negotiated for ghost trains, spectral carriers, hairy sausage rolls, and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and terribly boring. When the formula works, it is very good, but it sometimes becomes very pronounced and forced to make the movie seem more dated than it is. But the damned treacherous fifth colonists - thank everyone God, Britain hasn't got today! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a nice harmless movie welcomes you to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shaken out of your timber, you might be very disappointed!
