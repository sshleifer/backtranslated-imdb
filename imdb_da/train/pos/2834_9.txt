I haven't seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something to go by, I'm forced to see more! The simple yet effective story takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy, after Eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artistess has an affair with a wealthy lawyer's wife. I will not reveal anything further, but what results is a very fun series of events with the perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this movie. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... don't let the involvement of the young kids fool you into thinking it's a family movie) that loves comedy - even those who aren't familiar with the language.
