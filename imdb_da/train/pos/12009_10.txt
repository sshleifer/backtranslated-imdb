I really thought they did an * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with that, I don't know how the first comment could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (I suppose it moved about all to tears) but I'm not trying to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing, but one got me. It was SOOO good! I hope they release it on DVD because I definitely want to buy a copy! I want to renew my faith and gave me a hope that I cannot explain, it has made me strive to be a better person, they went through so much, and we take it for granted, I think. Compared to that, I want our own trials to be nothing. Well, nothing, but they hardly match what they have to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?!
