Historical drama and upcoming age story involving free people in color in pre-Civil New Orleans. Begin slowly, but choose steam when you have learned about the protagonists and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. They may not have had all the white rights, but they certainly had more control over their fate than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must each choose for themselves how to live their lives, whether to give in to the system's aggravation or to live with optimism and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
