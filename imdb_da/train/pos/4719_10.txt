This movie is why I found this site. I couldn't find this movie anywhere! I'm so glad we found it here! We've seen it on TV before and desperately wanted to find it and buy and have more friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring even though I have to say it is not. Especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. The horses are awesome, well trained and the movie is well done. It is certainly one we will buy for our home DVD library. We would recommend it to our friends. The connection between man and horse in this movie was so inspiring and made you spend more time with your horses. This is definitely a movie that we will see several times.
