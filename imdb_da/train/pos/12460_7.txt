Goodbye friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor among thieves is not perfect, but it is a nice and entertaining thriller who sees contradictory demobic French ally war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds Other to clean the two million in wages there are over the holiday season. Of course, things are not so simple, even after they have opened the vault, which leads to some nice twists. On the cover side, there is a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying Fonzie-like phrase, which he uses in the most incessant moments, Brigitte Fossey, who may practice the most frighteningly misunderstood hairstyle from the 60s ( Does her look like a bald woman whose wig blows back from the top of her head at a high wind), is no responsibility? her "I cook cooking spaghetti! I learn to love well! I read Shakespeare!" speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways ?? and it's a shame on the terrible last line / shot, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number worth checking out if you can find a decent print. <br /> <br /> The Cinema Club UK DVD only offers English soundtrack, but since Delon votes itself and the rest of the casting is pretty well called, it's not a big problem, especially since the widescreen transmission is pretty good quality.
