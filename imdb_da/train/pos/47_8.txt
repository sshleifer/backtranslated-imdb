It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. It is very undervalued. people forgot what movies really are about, today they only think about bum bum movies, which can be very fun to watch with popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies that are oriented, with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher, on special effects only and which are stupid movies without history. It's that kind of movie, I still like most. Of course it is fun to see much made CGIs, but we do not get anything important from that kind of movie. I honestly think the performance was excellent. Particularly busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (who I respect) made this movie an Oscar. Emotional performance from Busy Philipps was amazing, it's such a shame we won't see Oscar in her hands as she deserves.
