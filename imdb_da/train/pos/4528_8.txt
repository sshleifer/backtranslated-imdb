Although the film is clearly dated, the audience can still easily identify with the eerie busters situation in this timeless and very fun underdog story. Buster fights against inappropriate odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, the Roman age and the mature age, playing almost the same character with just a changing nature to help us identify the different "ages". In this film, we see one of the earliest comic depictions of the "caveman" stereotype that does not win its love by romance, but with brutal force, as well as a fun twist on Roman gladiatorial struggle, two comic sketches that long before for such spoofs as Mel Brooks' "World History: Part I". The underlying theme of the movie is simple but convincing: Although times may have changed, we are still in the same battle even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still a vogue). It is interesting to watch this movie for over 80 years and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's "modern era" to now.
