This film draws you so deep into the two main characters. I popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was fascinated by two fixed hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that breaks between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly physical contact. Towards the end I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and heroine to pull out their capes or simply complete their passion. RML could have done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plentiful. I'm nitpicking though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library, this film restored my belief in good filmmaking.
