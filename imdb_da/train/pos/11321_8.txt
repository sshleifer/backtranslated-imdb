When I started to watch the show, I said "Oh no! It's as cool as the Elf Lied and not even the bloody one!" And in fact, the setup is almost identical to the only young boy living in a big house alone and then suddenly getting involved in a great adventure while sexy young girls are going to live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where equality stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. The magic setup is a bit corny, because it is about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants are some famous, half of all masters are from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. But that soon dim and fall from the beauty drawing and script. I have actually seen all 24 episodes in a day and without comparing it to animate that I liked more, but was from other genres I have to say I was very happy.
