PREVENTED PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its influence was felt for more than a decade. However, some elements that relate to how this widespread entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties that are now gone, have dated quite a bit, and the movie's silence pacing does not help. But history's convincing central idea of ​​the ancient, extinct Krell civilization and "Monsters from the Id" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this movie a relevant "must see" movie. What I most interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is horrible. The film has never really looked so good at home video, and it is elements that have a great need for restoration. I hope it happens soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic.
