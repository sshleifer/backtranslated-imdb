I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and have seen many of his films so far, and none of them ceased to make me laugh. Nor how to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This movie is essentially about a man who pisses people off well. But he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous. But eventually he ends up making them the culture of life. The film is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of a round dance. Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.
