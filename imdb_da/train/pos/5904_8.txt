I was waiting to watch this movie for a long time. It's campaigns gave a good idea of ​​the content, and when I finally saw it, I found it really well made. Most of the conventional romantic films end with the lovers to get married or start a good life after marriage, but there really is a great adaptation needed for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is how this movie is about the period when a newly-married couple, Fardeen and Esha, get married through an arranged marriage and start their life with their honeymoon. The action is really spelling binding, though I think Esha remained a little quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. The story was well knit and dialogues were more or less suitable. The editing and direction was also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. In summary, I would say that it is a good drama with romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a pure entertainer.
