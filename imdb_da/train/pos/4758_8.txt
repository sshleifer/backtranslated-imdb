After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed into a frozen tree, two police officers find evidence that the event really happened, and apparently a martian had gone away. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Caf√©, and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers await the reopening of a snow in the bridge. But the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. While questioning the travelers, we find strange things in the dinner, with the lights on and off, and the turntable turns on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus follows its journey, a passenger returns to the dinner and reveals a plot of invasion of the earth. <br /> <br /> "Will the real martian stand up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The exciting story has ironic and witty dialogues, fun characters and situations and a surprising and completely unexpected plot point in the end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
