This impossible story is a female witch who is pursuing a deadly man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among its members, but she hides her witchcraft from the mortals. Hmmmm ... it starts to sound familiar. LAUGH OUT LOUD. It's not your typical movie. Very "campy" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> With new interest in all things that are wicked and dark, this movie deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ...... It's still a step!
