This is an excellent movie, and is the kind of treasure that can only be captured through occasional cinema shows as it is not available on video / DVD. The way in which the movie begins with the two lovers arriving and ending with those who leave (although a lot happens between them and they do not stay in one place during this time) gives you a feeling of closure and a feeling that everything is right with the world. If you get the chance to watch this movie, then you do it. I can't wait to see it again and want it to be put on general release.
