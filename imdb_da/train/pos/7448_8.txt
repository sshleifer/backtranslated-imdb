I haven't laughed so much for a long time - even though the movie also has some sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-fun to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most times, sometimes juicy, but completely credible. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I'm sorry about participating people. This film is instead a satire, and it does well. <br /> <br /> Too bad that all the explorers were * beeped * while this movie was broadcast on public television that takes a lot of fun out of it. I want to rent this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
