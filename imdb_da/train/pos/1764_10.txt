Steve Carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40-year-old virgin, having only a slight taste of having only received support features in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work at the Daily Show. The comedy, Carell really does his own. You can tell that Will Ferrell affects his "comedic air," but Carell takes it to another level, all he does is innocent, lovable, and fun. I wouldn't hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. The 40-year-old virgin is two hours of undisturbed laughing (or 4 hours if you see it twice as I did), a perfectly supportive cast and good leaders charming the audience throughout the film. The script was perfect with so many beautiful lines that you will see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fits the movie in the movie and you can tell the director what he did. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex jokes, some nudity and a lot of languages, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked wedding scratches, anchorman or any movie in that direction, you will absolutely love the 40 year old Virgin.
