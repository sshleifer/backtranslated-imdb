I know sometimes it's really really corny ... But the play is great and Melissa Joan Hart is as sweet as a button. I love this show a lot and I'm almost embarrassed that I do the b / c show has a rep. to be really corny, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to do it ... As Sabrina's father is 2 different guys during the movie ... I mean, they just couldn't say he was uncle or something? Still, I can't help loving this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really sweet couple and Salem is absolutely fun. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season angles ... When you come to college, Morgan goes with the group and her dialogue is painful and very badly acted ... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she only survives her beautiful looks, lost to me ... But I think it was created to have a really good eighth season, and I was really sorry to see one of My favorite shows canceled!
