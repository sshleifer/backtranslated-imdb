"If I wanted to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Haven't you had enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got me a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "If I start dying, remove (the cowboy hat) from my head. That's not the way I want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotes from this charming and often insightful film. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a non-father / father and son relationship that defines the man Arthur should stay. Will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? Over 25 years, I have returned to this film with joy and pleasure and joy. It's a movie to return to time and time again and remember what's important in life as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
