I watched this movie in the sixth grade around Christmas time, and I was really excited to see it, and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was really excited because I really love George C. Scott! When I and my class looked at this movie, I was really into it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was amazing! This is the best version of Charles Dickens' classic novel I've seen so far! George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the final Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other one is Patrick Stewart, but it's better! <br /> <br /> What is really good about this is the play, I thought the actors were great, everyone was, the spirits, little Tim, Bob Cratchit, all they couldn't have found any better than those they had made parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He's the final Ebenezer Scrooge, I don't think they could have found any better! I don't think they could have found anyone better off replacing someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the final movie adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, and I really think you agree you will think this movie is fabulous! I'll probably buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was amazing! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
