Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey work since The Truman Show, and was a pleasant surprise after some of his latest "Hey Hollywood - see how good I can shop!" box office disappointments. It's great to see Jim recognize and embrace his forces. He will not receive an Academy Award, but the film itself will last longer than many of the "awarded films" by the Academy. He is at the top of his form in this latest movie - it's like an old friend's return. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston all do well together - comfortably in their comedy roles, great comic timing, and of course having fun together but without "hi mother - see how fun I am" type of comedy . A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show fame), who walked away with some of the movie's best and funniest scenes. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that religious nuts in the United States will be weapons of God's treatment, but the bottom of films is true to all major theological beliefs - we are lots of protoplasms trying to get through our short life by exercising our free will. Without married children, I complain about it, it will probably be a goal for people with wrong priorities (who knows the types - men adorned in gold watch on Sunday morning and late television selling prayers to God). And again, about 0.5% of the country will care, and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is a purely entertaining movie, each audience wondering what they would do, and an emotional feeling at the conclusion of the film. A trip down any main street in America must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us than Jim Carry. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - it's great to have you back !!
