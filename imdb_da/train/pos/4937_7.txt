This movie is actually relevant, even today given the threat of biot terrorism and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus and SARS. As a voltage, the voltage is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The homely scenes between Widmark and his wife give a good interlude to the main plot. The actor in this movie, which left most of its mark, is Jack Palance. His sharply defined characteristics and seemingly pulsing exterior are always fond of revealing the harmless and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the package is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
