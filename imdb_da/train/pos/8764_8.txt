Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been best friends ever since, and after they finish, they decide to take a trip to Thailand. Due to an incident, they encounter a young attractive mysterious stranger inviting them to take him with Hong Kong on the weekend. But at the airport Alice and Darlene are confused with drug trafficking heroine, and they are sent to jail. Now is the time for ultimate survival and true friendship. This was a great movie, I've seen it a couple of times, and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a good job as usual, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
