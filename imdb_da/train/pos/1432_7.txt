I was really looking forward to watching this movie as it has been announced as a must-see movie for people who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the North Pole and going south as the film progresses. The footage of this film is often breathtakingly beautiful and I wondered many times how on earth they could have taken some of the shots underwater or in the sky. But beautiful, much of the footage I had already seen in the television series 'Planet Earth', told by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's story of Planet Earth much better than Earth's story. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It skips much of the scientific detail covered by Attenborough in its 'Planet Earth' series. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals such as large sharks, etc. It's an important difference to me. That along with Attanborough's far superior voice makes Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth. Still, I think the Earth is worth looking at the beautiful recording, and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it also interesting for children.
