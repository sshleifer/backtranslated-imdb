In 1978, a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" made people drive around the block to see the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, was imitated and has fallen down as one of the greatest films in film history. Plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting (and having their boyfriends) on Halloween night. Having escaped from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to steal these people. He kills 3 of them quietly and subtly. He doesn't speak. He walks slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one friend escapes after being rescued by Doctor Loomis (Michael's pursuer and doctor). There is a reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills and he scares us. They are the only reasons why we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the movie and instructed. He builds unbearable excitement through history and scares to such an extent that we sometimes cannot see. And climax is really spectacular. <br /> <br /> Like horror, this is important. It's scary and well acted. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human being. A force that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequels focused too much on Michael and his "story". This film focuses on fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this is a masterpiece.
