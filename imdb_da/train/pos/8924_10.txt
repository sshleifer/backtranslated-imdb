This movie is wonderful. What sets it apart from other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no functions, no face, eyes, anything, but it can't be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie does not take place in a few days, it happens in one night, which probably lasted past midnight. It is also scary that when blob comes to you, you can't get it off. You are stuck in it as it dissolves your meat and slowly consumes your body. My all-time favorite 50's sci-fi movie, and what is sometimes considered the hallmark. I can see why this rocked Steve McQueen into stardom. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?
