This movie earned each of the ten voices I gave it! Thanks guys for making a movie worth seeing. You showed the world you can still write, directly, produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes. The poetry was also great, hats to the poets and the musicians. <br /> <br /> I saw it last night when I fell in love with my loved one again. I will add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Continue to produce quality, don't worry about the quantity .... Thanks again and best wishes and blessings to you!
