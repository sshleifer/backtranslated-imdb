I have to admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. But after the festival's artistic director recommended this movie to an audience of over 200 people prior to the screening of another movie, I decided to go to see it. Wow! <br /> <br /> This movie is about the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does it without compromise. I have found myself crying a number of times during the film and laughing at others. Talking about an emotional roller coaster. The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese beginner (who was only 14 at the time of the movie) and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role. She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute. Chances are she'll win several awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl sold to prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to seeing from him) who, after spending some time with her, decides to help her. But then she was sold again and he is looking for her around Cambodia. The story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next time. <br /> <br /> The action was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (touching social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). The Asian cast was also amazing. <br /> <br /> Though the movie deals with this tricky topic, it successfully focuses on telling a compelling, powerful story. It was shot in Cambodia (some scenes in real operator tables), which increases the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary. It seems that DP used a lot of handheld camera and close-ups and generally made you feel like you were there as part of the story. After the screening, I listened to other members of the audience as they left and it seemed they were all stunned. This is not an easy movie to see and I welcome the filmmakers not to make a "Hollywood Movie". It's by far the best movie I've seen in the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared by my husband and a few other friends.
