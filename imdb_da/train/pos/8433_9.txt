The action in this movie was amazing, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made it heartbreaking. It was good that the author isolated Boesman and Lena from others, running from their homes, so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart. Worth to see when you put the movie in the right context.
