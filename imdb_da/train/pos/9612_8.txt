The good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some fun scenes. It also makes you think of the small things in life that could greatly affect another's life without knowing it. It's a small world, and this little movie shows us. The bad thing: There are too many characters, and it's hard to tell who the protagonist is, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <It's a great movie, and many people compare it to Magnolia, which I haven't seen. <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would rate it PG-13 for short violence, some linguistic and sexual situations.
