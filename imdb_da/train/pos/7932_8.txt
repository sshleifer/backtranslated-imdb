When I see a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that the action should not be as good (budget reasons), I expect that the lighting should not be as good (budget reasons). I expect that the sound will not be as good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget films as a big budget movie !!! I'm a movie maker myself, so I understand the budget constraints on a low budget film. Steal places, shots etc ... the list goes on and on. I wouldn't say everything was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not sold at Carl Washington yet. He must understand that each line is not important, some are throwing lines. I say if a movie makes you see what's happening next time, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it a 8. I wanted to see what was going to happen next time. Good work Quiroz brothers!
