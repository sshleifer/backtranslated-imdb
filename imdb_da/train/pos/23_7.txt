OK, so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally badly sung (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And then they burst the fourth wall at the end by singing the king and his noble singers about the "fight" with the years and praising Puss in Boot's efforts when they are not entitled to it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, making a movie based on an adventure, and he sings and dances. His plays fit well with the role of the rude, vicious puss, who seems to get his master deeper and deeper, but actually has a plan he has thought of seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his heavy roles, then you know a little dusty HARD at the end when Walken got him in his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must-see for anyone enjoying Christopher Walk's unique style.
