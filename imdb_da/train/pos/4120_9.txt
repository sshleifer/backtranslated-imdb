<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made what would be his first movie in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film centering on many mixed stories that take place in a small Tokyo slum. The title comes from the sound a mentally delayed boy does as he imagines that he is driving a train. We slowly learn more people in the small community, the two drunks who act wives because they are not happy with those they have. The old man who is the center of the city helps a burglar trying to rob him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a house so they imagine one of their own. At the end of the film, the stories come full circle, some turn out happy, others sad. As this was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he is using it to his advantage and it shows. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions, and it's hard to settle down and get into it. But don't understand me, Dodes' Ka-Den may not be Kurosawa's best, but comes from the greatest instructor all the time, it's much better than 99% of today's movie.
