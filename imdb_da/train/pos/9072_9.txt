I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and wanted to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie came out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We hurried home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Wasn't necessary. The only thing that is common between the book and the movie is the protagonists' first name, the fact that there is a bet, and a lot of worms. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the child who cooks most worms likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How the kids know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet came, the number of worms to eat, the time frame where he should eat the worms, how they are cooked, progress of friendships, climax scenes, etc. nothing is the same. But somehow it didn't destroy the movie for me. The characters are all enjoyable and the movie did not leave me disappointed. Be careful with parents who were a moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively breathing, and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "dilly dick". The embarrassing part came when my daughter continued to ask those around us: "Does anyone know what a dilly dick is?" laugh out loud. That and an occasional "shut up" are just as wrong as this movie gets. My daughter thought she could get sick about worms 3 and 4 (and kept the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine with worm 6. She and I both really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
