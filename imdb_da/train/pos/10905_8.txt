In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell into the slightest touch as his body was covered with painful wounds and led to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, the first release in March, which was an uplifting, confusing and provocative humorous story of a unique man. Not shading away from EB's ugly reality, the film was also a celebration of a life lived fully. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary for that year. It attracted almost five million viewers and after the screening, the public gave over half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was set up to raise another half a million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy left a million pound heritage.
