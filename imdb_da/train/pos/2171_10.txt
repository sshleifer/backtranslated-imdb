A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the manuscript is a frightening sequel to exciting scenes. Scenes in cars and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this movie is already out on DVD because it should be viewed in the Widescreen version. Saw this movie at the end of the fifties, maybe three or four times, and has never since forgotten it. I remember it was one of the first Warner movies' film properties, process called Warnerscope, which gave a very clean filmography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize has not been led by anyone like, says Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and excitement.
