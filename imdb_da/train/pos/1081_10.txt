One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical movie, a buyer beware of guidance for a new home. <br /> <br /> Filled with great characters, whom Cary Grant is convinced, is out flying him in the construction of a dream home. <br /> <br /> A good look at life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
