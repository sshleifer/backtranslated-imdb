This highly-derived film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen any of the more unclear animated films. I enjoyed most of it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and contains some of the better bit animation). James Garner as Commander and Leonard Nimoy as the King provide impressive performances.
