In this wonderful tale of a weekend divided between literary greats. Mary and Percy Shelly, Lord Byron and others created an incoming group. Shows their missions for sexual enlightenment. Personal freedoms from political to moral. Liberal drug use for both stimulations and addiction. Their creative outlook on life and writing. Describe without knowing the viewer how each author seeks to find their mouse. Along with the distractions and feelings, each one shares. With breathtaking scenery that does not detract but much improves history. Well created characters from the grim to love so angry at peaceful. With some of the most delightful and stage-enhancing costuming to be had.
