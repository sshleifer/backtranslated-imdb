I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was a bit absent at times, but I enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is the only other movie I saw Verdone acting (the other was 'Un sacco bello') and I can see why the Italians find him tiring, but he thinks he played his role as the loving father. <br /> <br /> My only drawback to this movie was that I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the city center or south, I suppose, but I felt there was no representation of a place. This movie could have happened in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important for movies to have a place to give viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you will enjoy it here. It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a comic story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us.
