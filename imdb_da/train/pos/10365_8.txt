This is a true story of an Australian couple, who is accused of murder when their infants disappear. Meryl Streep is excellent as always and manages to keep our interest even though she plays a character that is not particularly sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Mediefenzyen, who referred to this case in Australia, is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard's killing in Ohio during the 50s. These real situations show that the media can actually influence how a criminal case is handled. I remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a big headline stating "Why isn't Sam Sheppard in prison?". The prosecutor finally made this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in prison was he liberated. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a true story, do it in an interesting way, and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good films that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film, which is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
