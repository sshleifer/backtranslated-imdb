Two movies back to back that treated Indian POWs; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story about a guy who gives everything up for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject himself. It is not hidden that many Indian POWs are reporting in Pakistani prisons for years - for whom neither Indian government is. have time or sympathy or the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani POWs are also in India, but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a major, worked well. Akshaye Khanna did her part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and couple of songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was most solid, though it wasn't too long. He acted really well here, and his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was only a day-long movie with history going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-documented movie that keeps a good pace and makes right for all actors. 7.5 / 10
