EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the narrative film almost a century ago. This movie is truly unique and a genius work. The camera and editing are brilliant, and combined with the story of the alienation used in the film, creates a creepy and unforgettable movie experience. Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantin's participation in the casting are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow gives his big voice as the narrator. <br /> <br /> One of a kind movie! Four stars (highest rating).
