This is one of the unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad and unfortunate death at the box office. I watched this movie at a local art cinema, in revitalization, shortly after the thought of mainstream cinemas. It certainly deserves to be contacted another time (or even a third). Sandra B. limits it to speaking and taking some familiar songs in this piece (her version of Hank Willem's "I'm so lonely I could cry" could easily move you to tears). Perhaps one day the audience will be ready to take this movie a little more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughs too). The movie moves at a great pace (thanks to some fine edits), so some viewers do not find it obsolete and boring. Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.
