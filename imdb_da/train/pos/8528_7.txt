I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I had never seen him portray an upper class Brit until this movie. He pulls it well even though you see bits of Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It won't be interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to deliver such a solid performance. Her timing was great and her expression was invaluable. The way she alternately changes Sellers lecherous character and seduces him is beautiful to see. Verbal sparring that I have rarely seen from a movie in that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie fall flat. It is worth failing just to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a few brilliant seconds early. Enjoy it...
