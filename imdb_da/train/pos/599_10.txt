I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the actor. The script was top class. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this step was Raul Julia who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times. While some might think the movie was slow, it caught the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a few hours of horrible terror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. At this time and age when no one stands for anything, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of time.
