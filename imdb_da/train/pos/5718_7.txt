I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which, of course, should be scary, were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't consider this a bad movie. Nor is it a good movie. Just a pretty well made horror movie. It is not dependent on special effects, but on camera angles, plays, music. In my opinion, the action was ok. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were certainly not bad either, I liked Yoko. The sets are fine (and I don't care that the sets are the same as those used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I've seen pretty horror, and didn't expect to be scared now, but at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The movie had some pretty scenes that were almost original, like the traces of waste, the simple special effects for his ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat making scary sounds, gurgling the dead boy and his mother . Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode because it's very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough excitement. I gave it a 7.
