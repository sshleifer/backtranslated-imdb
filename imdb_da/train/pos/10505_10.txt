Yes it's true. I firmly believe that the N64 and the weird leader controller were both designed so that this game could be made. It was amazing the first time I saw it with its huge environments and colorful characters, and it's great now. The playback control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has the Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. One must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get an N64 to everyone else.
