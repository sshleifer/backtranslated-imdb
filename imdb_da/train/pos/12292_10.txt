I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is a detail I would like to shed light on: no pictures of the real still standing, Hôtel du Nord (Is it still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on the watch, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin channel for weeks.
