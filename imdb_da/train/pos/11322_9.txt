This anime seriously rocked my socks. When the anime first opened, I felt it was too slow; The story didn't go all the way, and Shirou was quite an impressive male leader. As he learns more about tracking and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail itself, the story goes out and you can see more aspects of what is moving together. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> I also felt that the way the characters evolved was very true to form with the real people evolving in the real world. There were no stupid absolutely obvious things going on; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to see, but I think how Shirou and Saber grew in their particular personalities was just interesting to see. A few of the "surprising" people appearing (Gilgamesh?) Also seemed to be unique from the rest of the cast somehow, meaning we did not have "Generic Bad-ass A" replaced by "Generic Bad-ass B "as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the music. The opening music rocked, and finishing theme from the last episode just ... Seriously pushed the theme of the last episode even more. Good work, Type-MOON!
