This was at 2 or so in the morning a Saturday some years ago for various reasons I can't remember the whole story, but what's left is the two standout notions from the key characters. They have had an unfortunate lot, manipulated and literally working a garbage can, Eugene struck between personal desires and duty towards his siblings. Tom Hulce's Dom does not accuse sympathy - it comes naturally. Ray Liotta is a universe away from Henry Hill that shows a soft center. In many ways, it is about the dilemma of many young carers' face - the past or the future. As it turns out, with some work they can happily co-exist. Carefully handled and sensitively played Dominick & Eugene Is hard to not heat to.
