The Great Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting ability and is in top form as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano in the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say he does some songs better than Caruso (see A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGM art and music departments also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, it was not for the creepy presence of Ann Blyth; We see that she is trying her best, dressed in the 50s style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better leading lady, and Blyth had to adhere to less demanding productions. Also note that Mrs Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, which gives the wrong idea that Caruso had some kind of permanently conducting soprano.
