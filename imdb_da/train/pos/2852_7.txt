This movie has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a grocery store, and the store consultant catches him in the action ... the thief runs away with the shop assistant right after him. Still, the store consultant is in trouble with a low rank yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along the hunt for the thief, they get the eyes of Yakuza, who has been looking for the grocery store. The story then moves into high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but added with the dog chasing the cat. The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (translates into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about the hunt, and the hunt goes on and on to the point that bum forgets why he runs away at the end of the second act and Yakuza don I can't Remember which of the two guys he is hunting, and he does not remember why they run away from him. <br /> <br /> Like SABU's later movie POSTMAN BLUES, the bulk of the movie is simply chase and action, with lots of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What is short is the end that chase stops when the three men run out of steam and in one of the most chaotic Mexican stand-offs, you see movies that almost look like Sabu was a tribute to Tony Scott's SAND ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
