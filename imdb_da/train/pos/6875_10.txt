When I was the chair of our college's caf√©, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come together in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original assumption was that it was shown off-off Broadway in theaters where television screens were placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a good seat. The premise was that the sketches would change regularly - ala Saturday Night Live, and keep the case fresh. They decided to make it a movie for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. Seeing him run naked, even though the forest was a cave. Like many of the reviews before mine, it was Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this vid. I told my 13 year old son about the Koko clown. He can't wait to get a copy!
