As many know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called gold age of the Mexican cinema, fortunately in the late 90s and early 21st century there were amazing films such as La Ley de Herod, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, appeared. El Coronel ... is a wonderful movie that tells the classic story of Gabriel García Márquez by eliminating the magic elements of realism and replacing them with the raw reality that lived in Mexico, not just by people like the colonel waiting for their pensions, but with more than half of the Mexican population living in complete poverty. The film's characters represent satirical classic characters found in Mexican society, such as the nationalist colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time the loyal companion, the tolerant and patient wife, the hidden gay, etc. This film is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to watch a beautiful movie by one of Mexico's finest directors
