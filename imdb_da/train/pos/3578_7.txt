12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His emotions are arrested by his family not being able to interact with him (or not feeling right). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have compassion for him. Realism will captivate "true-2-life" movie lovers, but will not satisfy those who want action and excitement.
