I love Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is such a great actor and so is Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? He's so sweet, isn't it? I hated the bits where he was obsessed with the devil and where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose so firmly put it. Mind you, he was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, will you? Shut up!". Mr. Jefferson was so brave, wasn't he? To die to save the others. I was really sorry Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of possession for the second time because he was so scared. I was like "Oh my God, if I were Rose, I would be so scared of him". And when she hugged him, I was like "grrrrrr, he's my! Hands!" but i thought it was really cute. And the doctor .... Well, I thought he would say to Ida "Tell Rose I love her" but he didn't. Oh good.
