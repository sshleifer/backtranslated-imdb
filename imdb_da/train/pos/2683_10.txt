Franco again shows that he is the prince of surrealistic and erotic cinema. True, much of his work can be seen as entertaining sleaze, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he can really do when he lets his combed creativity run and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic while one maintains the delirious eroticism inherent in his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's amazing score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another, as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who can be schizophrenic, or perhaps (as a mysterious character says) be a devil, attempt to express themselves with the world she resides. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema is highly recommended to anyone who is even interested in alternative cinema.
