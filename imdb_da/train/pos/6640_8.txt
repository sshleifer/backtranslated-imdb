This one-minute movie is undoubtedly the first movie ever made. Other inventors had previously filmed actions - like Edison's motion photography of a sneeze - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that immensely advanced the medium. At that time, of course, their "cinematograph" must have confused their peers, including their profession. Initially, the brothers register employees who leave their factory, some of whom understandably are struggling to hide their awareness of the camera. Lumieres is trying to make the movie more entertaining by introducing animals and a bike, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" does not nearly match the ingenuity of their later movie. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' choice of a well-known working class ritual as their subject. Their choice is the first proof of their curiosity about the world's peoples, a quality that makes their experiments extremely rewarding and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
