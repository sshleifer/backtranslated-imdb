With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully a year ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely strong element. Dr. The leg (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to find the item. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even stronger than radium and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science-fiction movie in post-Second World War era. Director Hillyer used a pair of standing sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series, which were filmed simultaneously and also included some recordings of Frankenstein's electric machines. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoy working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.
