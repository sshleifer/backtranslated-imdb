As other reviewers have noted, this is an improperly neglected depression-era movie. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave her to heaven, Western, lifeboat, etc.), it is a hard-minded, well-structured and realized feature of citizens in a New York City shantytown. They are greats, beggars and women forced to prostitution, but they are a community of people both good and bad, with loyalty as complex as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the film's many admirable qualities are the contrast between Spencer Tracy's character, Bill and Loretta Young's Trina. He is patient, physically aggressive and obviously fearless - but Bill is not the character that gives this movie its steely sense of survival. While he blusters, Trina actually hangs hard (if this term can be applied to a character so ladylike). Her devotion to him is manifest and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll raise herself if he wants to leave, or "I'll even give up the baby if you just want to be happy." Such is Loretta Young's performance (aged 20 years) as a simple character, that she does not seem weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and does not want anything more.
