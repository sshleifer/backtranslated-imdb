A well-cast summary of a real event! Well, actually, I wasn't there, but I think it was how it could have been. I think there are two typical American positions in the film: 'communist philosophy' and parallels with Adolf Hitler. These should be clear to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe does a great performance and so do many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - it all happened and it probably looked just like that). But actually did the last scene at the airfield really take place?
