If you are like me then you will love this great commercial teen movie. I think it's up there with mischief / book of love / high school USA / shout / calendar girl / crybaby / all the amazing movies in lazy 50s & early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these types of movies but still great.it is all so much fun at times and has a great love interest.all the young cast is great.i wish there was more type of these wonderful movies.my favorite movies of all time are back to the future when Marty mcfly Going back to 1955 well in these amazing movies, it stays in the fab 50s (early 60s) there are some movies of this type better than this but not many.
