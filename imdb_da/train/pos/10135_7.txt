What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat boring affair is finally quite hilarious and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very exciting, but it does more than that with some outlandish sets and over the top gore. Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Top credits also go to the dead performance of Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. If you play the character in a great "secluded" fashion, you almost feel bad for the guy when his grand plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews nature and plays a not-so-good man who gets his only desserts. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler. As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, "Right to Die" benefits greatly from its artists and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour.
