I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the bad guys were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. However, the film needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the film at the beginning and occasionally in the rest. I always thought the new animated series had a little justice to the gorgeous new Robin character, let alone Knightwing. This movie just continues the bad tradition. The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in a movie if the romance wasn't so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I'd recommend seeing it.
