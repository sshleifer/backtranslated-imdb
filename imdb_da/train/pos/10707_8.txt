For a movie that received little advertising and few people heard of, it was pretty good. It's another of these modern British crime movies that are quirky ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch", but it's interesting and it has some rough characters. It also has a corny and slightly predictable ending, but early in the show - not late - has some nice twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it is about a low-Norwegian British man who sends away to a Russian "mail order bride" who is won with the help of two Russian male friends who give a few big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is another kind of movie and well-behaved. Kidman again shows that she is far more than just a beautiful face.
