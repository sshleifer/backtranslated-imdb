I had no expectations; I had never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the film has some strong character players in it. I thought it was very entertaining; it was fun. The reason was different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is amazing (true, this is not his finest role). I thought chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the movie and were well done. I didn't expect much and I was happily surprised.
