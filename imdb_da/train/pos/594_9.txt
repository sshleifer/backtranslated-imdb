13 days to Glory tells the traditional narrative with sympathy to the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this movie was that while the cowboy actor James Arness played Jim Bowie's convincing role, the rest of the name actors in the cast were Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) too old. <Br /> <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who, after all, won the fight. The scene where he encourages his officers not to mount a guard and prevent a black one is one you did not write. Don't keep an eye out is a great record in the military. Santa Anna was angry within her prerogatives. Raul Julia brought wonderful writing through the scene. Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York could have been reminded that, as Dickinson's tribute from Pennsylvania probably doesn't sound much Southron.
