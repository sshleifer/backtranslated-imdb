While this movie style is not as discreet and realistic as an audio version would have been, it is still a very good movie. In fact, it was seen as an excellent movie in its time as it was nominated for the first best image Oscar (loses to WINGS). I still consider WINGS to be a superior movie, but this one is excellent despite a bit overactive by the manager, Emil Jannings. Jannings is a general from Tsarist Russia who lives in his last days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a Hollywood extra. Her luck seems to have changed when he gets a casting call - to play an imperial Russian general fight against the Communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not so much of an action, but it also causes the old to think about the old days and the revolution. </p> <p> Exactly what happens next time, I'll leave you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Although he was made in 1928, he does not look much younger with makeup than many of his later films.
