When this was originally shipped in 1984, my wife and I taped it on our very first VHS recorder. I still have the aging tape that I try to see annually. It was the year my first child was born and seeing a Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings happy memories of happy times - many hours were spent with this movie in the background. I finally dropped this year and ordered a DVD that made me take a moment to write this short reaction to the movie. Charles Dickens' story is recorded in a unique way here. George C. Scott is absolutely wonderful and credible as Scrooge. The support molding is just as spectacular. In my opinion this is a flawless production. Small details give much to the enjoyment. The game "similes" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a nice item. (I have since restored it with my high school students in English as a short break from class work!) Honestly, I can think of a few ways to entertain me during the holidays, I enjoy more than indulge in this CBS production, which was Originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old band with the original IBM commercials ... showing how much computers have evolved for 21 years. Great how things changed!) Bottom line: A Christmas Carol is a timeless story and this rendering is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God Bless us, every one!
