I had a chance to watch a movie of this movie recently. I think it will be in theaters in Canada sometime around Mother's Day. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a fun feeling-good movie - it's more in line with an emotional and thought movie. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development - so you can get into the heart, mind and evil of Hagar little by little. Initially, her attitudes and behavior do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes a person you can understand. As in life ... understanding understands empathy. I found her as well at the end of the movie - especially when she opened her heart to the young man in the ship at the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and reflects many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, full of life and adventure, takes the viewer to the edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw feeling that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> Watching Ellen Page deals in this movie is fun. She is so much different from the young woman she plays in Juno. It gives me an even broader understanding of her abilities. If you loved her in Juno, you'll love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power to act as strongly as the ability of the actor to make you forget about any other characters they have ever played. Never once during this film did I ever think of Ellen Burnstyn - I always and only thought about Hagar. She swept me into her character - hook, line and sinker. <br /> <br /> Kari Forest's ability to capture movies is this famous book by one of Canada's most beloved writers impressive. She brilliantly brings the screen both stoney and English parts of this complex woman, the Hagar Stone Angel.
