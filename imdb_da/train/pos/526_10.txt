If anyone ever asks if the cinema is an art form, you can do worse than point to this movie. It is simply the perfect combination of history, script, actors and filmography ever committed to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a convicted bomber pilot missed by his heavenly conductor in the English fog during World War II, and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities (or in his head) are played with panache by David Niven and Kim Hunter are incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the convicted pilot (Niven) describes his situation to the ground radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The sensation of the other world is enhanced by Jack Cardiff's photography and the incredible production designs. The biggest strikes extend to the skies of the sky, which appear in black and white and earthy scenes presented in Technicolor - this is even mentioned by the heavenly leader (a marvelous Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not only a highpoint in British cinema, but a highlight of cinema, period.
