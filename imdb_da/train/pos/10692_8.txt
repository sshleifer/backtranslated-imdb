Good, fun, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). This was a good "vehicle" for anyone skilled in comedy and drama, as there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, beautiful lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Maybe they are too incredible. Ebert didn't even send a review for this. The big "screwball" comedies were of course totally unlikely ("Bringing Up Baby", etc.). If you've seen an unfaithful comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. Strange. Birthday girl is a movie I have had several times. Nicole Kidman can be the "killer app" for home video.
