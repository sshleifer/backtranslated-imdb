Almost the whole movie takes place in a public bathhouse in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or glamorous people - only fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, notes!). A foreign son returns when he thinks his father is dying. He is surprised to see dad look good and go about running the family business as usual. In fact, he notes that his father and his late brother have really forged a close and caring relationship, and it soon becomes clear that he is out of the loop! Father is very traditional, and this visiting son is from the big city and does not really see the value of the old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is extraordinary and credible. <br /> <br /> I was pleased to see that not all Chinese movies are an action picture (like those starting Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), as I am not particularly aware of these frenetic films. The shower and Springtime in a small town are two fantastic examples of good Chinese films about people!
