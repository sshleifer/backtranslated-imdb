No, there's another! Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I, II, and III, and because that meaning was biased, as we missed the atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy so much, I would point out the good points of "the return of the Jedi" and one couple of similar bad points in the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but it has been overly debated elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this movie: - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militaristic positions - Fascinating insight into the Jedi order and the force - Sweet creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A killer scene: Near the end when Vader looks alternatively to his son and the emperor. The lightning of the deadly bolts is reflected on its black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his master to save Luke and thereby risk his own life! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong in prequel INMHO: - the whole element "human factors" that the original caste was able to push forward, missing in some way - Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sear on the screen - lack of experience with a few actors often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /> <br /> by the way, if you enjoy the theory of power as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then read a few books on Buddhism and the forms it took in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage of a master of his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. "They must be toned" (from my soul to yours) who would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
