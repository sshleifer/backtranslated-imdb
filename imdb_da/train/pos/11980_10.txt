The full house was and still is a good show. It is a great show for people of all ages and is also a good family program. There are really no shows like this anymore. The kids are very sweet, and although it is a bit cheesy, it is still good, especially for everyone who saw it when they were children. I would love to see the cast interview now. Anyone who would like to see interviews of the cast as a kind where they now write things to the DVD's special features must go to the Petition website and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD, as there is a petition to this in hope that the cast might do it. Yay for full house!
