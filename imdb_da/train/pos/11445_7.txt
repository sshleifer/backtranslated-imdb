A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see their work going. To see Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspires and affects his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowball), I feel it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life and created a beautiful movie that was a joy to watch.
