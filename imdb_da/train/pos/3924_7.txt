This 1939 movie by director John Ford and author Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trials (literally) and his trials. It is a sentimental film, reasonably well made, but hardly breathtaking. Casting Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems like a mistake, because while the actor had the right bad qualities for the part, even with several inches of makeup and false nose, he is too beautiful for Honest Monkey who was famous homely. It is a good attempt by Fonda, which is nothing if not sincere, but his miscasting casts out the whole movie. However, the support is excellent and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverent in its treatment of Lincoln, which is presented as just shy for a weekend, and in the last scene, the film goes way above the top.
