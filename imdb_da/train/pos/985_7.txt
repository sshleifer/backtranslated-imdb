This movie is in many ways similar to "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman as we have an innocent (black) man who is being persecuted by the "government" with all the modern technology known to him. Normally when history is copied like this, the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course, I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were several good things about this movie. The main baddy played by Doug Hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed with good extras such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. However, our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was annoying most of that. He is out of place, breaks bad jokes and evokes no sympathy from the audience. Or not to begin with, the strange thing is that he grows a little on you (and also on his followers!). I didn't expect much when I rented it, but was surprised by a good solid action movie with comedy bits. 10.7
