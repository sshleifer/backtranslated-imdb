Anyone who loves Rheostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mainly about pacing and cast of certain actors (not Maury) who are not convincing in their roles, but I have no time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has watched this movie or plans to watch this movie as presented CBC TV in Canada: The version flying is CBC is like Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- don't see it. It cuts entire scenes and subplots (if you can them) from the movie. The CBC, which presents most of the films untouched, took half the stomach out of WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did with the movie. Rent the video or watch it at a theater, but don't watch it on CBC TV.
