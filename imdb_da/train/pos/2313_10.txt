This movie "coming of age" deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love a fateful summer. Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his fantastic work in "Killing a Mockingbird", the movie never hits a fake note. All plays are amazing. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a fantastic movie debut. I felt like I was looking at this beautifully photographed and wonderfully directed and edited movie, and I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie. I have seen this movie at least five times and can honestly say that it is one of the best single movies ever made to be young, in love and going through emotions, challenges and changes in adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together and use it as a discussion piece as it raises a number of questions about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, a parent's responsibility, etc.
