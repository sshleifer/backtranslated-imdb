Congratulations on the same year as Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's scary masterpiece "Vertigo", they also made this easy comedy. Maybe the two actors had to do it after they had been subjected to Hitchcock's movie. At least this is a great companion to "Vertigo" as it again explores a very unlikely but powerful romance. In fact, the film can be seen as the cover of "Vertigo" with the happy ending. Here, Novak undergoes a transformation in Vertigo, she plays essentially two women, and here she transforms from witch to mortal. Stewart is once again excited and for some time plagued by her love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two come together in "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote to Hitcock movies. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but in a completely different vein. The cast is amazing. Lemmon fun as Novak's Warlock brother and Elsa Lancaster provide a classic aunt's performance. Ernie Kovacs as the alcoholic cult author and of course Hermoine Gingold plays Novak's competitor are all good. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at the best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you do not, you should see this memorable bright comedy.
