Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I have read both his books and believe he is great. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a family that really gets to know each other. Through a road trip, a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all the things that fathers and sons suppose to do in life ... they just do them much later in life. The situation is very fun, but has the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish). This is the first time I see Paul Reiser and fully believed in all the emotions that were portrayed. At times, his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie and great story and plot. It has comedy and feelings, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great deal too :)
