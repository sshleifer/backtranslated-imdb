<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a good little movie ok, some of the sets are bad, and the play is not that big, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old now and was made very cheap in 1st place so you can't moan too much about the bad parts. Then just sit back and watch a cool movie with big big robots in it.
