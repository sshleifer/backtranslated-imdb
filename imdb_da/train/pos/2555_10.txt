The movie wasn't that great. The book is better. But the film wasn't too bad either. It was interesting to say the least. The reason had enough excitement to keep me looking even though I wouldn't say I was actually interested in the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both beautiful enough to keep you in mind :) They have a couple of cute scenes that should appeal to the romantic. Overall, I would give the movie a 7 or 8. It wasn't bad, just a little lacking plot wise.
