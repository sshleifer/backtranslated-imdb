If you haven't heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, don't worry about it. It would be classified alongside the other Disney films intended for educational purposes such as "family planning". <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation, supposably. It only educates on a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System sequence. <br /> <br /> The movie shows "The Wonderful World of Disney" elements such as page rotation and animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, good luck to you and enjoy.
