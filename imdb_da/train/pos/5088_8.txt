I never had a curl while I watched the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought this was a very good movie from the late 90s. But after I saw on the Internet that this was intended for the TV, I was shocked because for a television movie it is absolutely amazing! What worried me most was the length. I felt that one on a battle scene should have been removed, as it was completely unnecessary. It also began to pull towards the end, as it looked as if the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little off the record. I also felt that Gogool, who looked demented, became a little stupid on some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. But it's a great movie for the television. 8 out of 10
