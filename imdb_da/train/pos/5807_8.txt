This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message about drugs, amazing special effects and a great music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie is centered on the song and music video 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike the four minute music video, it's normal speed and in my opinion much easier to see. However, the plot is quite strange. Michael Jackson plays a magical 'gangster' who, when he sees a shooting star, turns into a piece of machinery. Throughout the film he is transformed into a racing car, a huge robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a bit pronounced and strange. I found it a bit uneven compared to the rest of the movie. A kid was kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten and suddenly becomes a giant robot that blows all the bad guys. A little strange? Yes. <br /> <br /> But besides the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
