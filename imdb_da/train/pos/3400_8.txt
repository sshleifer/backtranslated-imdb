Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he's dead, she's free - but doesn't know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and marry. But he can't leave his past, and she can't live without him ... <br /> <br /> WAY excessive romance full of hysterical poor dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing their best to give good performance, but NOBODY could get away with some of their lines! Still in a way it's a classic. It is shot in beautiful Technicolor (try to watch it on DVD), where each frame is beautifully beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed for the 9's (even in the middle of the desert) and hits hysterical bags to show off the clothes and her body. Boyer just goes around and looks hit (no shock there). Yet I never got bored. It was great to look at and the non-stupid stupid dialogue kept me stuck. The end almost made me fall out of my chair because I laughed so hard! Now I love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really --- it's incredible! It also goes very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic, I give this a 8. Like a serious movie - a 1.
