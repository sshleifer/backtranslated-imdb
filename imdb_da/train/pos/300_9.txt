With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout the cast and crew "They all laugh" is very much a family affair. If you add that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a short but passionate affair on a previous image, it has the air of almost a private movie made to enjoy the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience is just a supplement . If this all tastes like the "in-joke" self-confidence, you will be glad to hear that Mr Bogdanovich is well off the special danger and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" paean it is also an altar where we can worship the glorious Miss Hepburn's essential beauty. Don't make a mistake, this is her picture. Mrs. Gazzara admits it to her most independently effacingly in all their scenes together. The reason - a detective agency becomes involved in personal matters of its customers - is of little importance, it is the performance of the two leaders who dominate the film. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors from "Goals" and forward. There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can gather from a lifeless piece of optical equipment. Perhaps Hepburn has particular benefits from this love. Additional insights into his work can be obtained by reading the published collections of his essays on stars and instructors, mainly "Who the hell is in it?" Recently detained in British bookstores. The soundtrack to "All Everyone Laughed" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin, as eclectic as the city it depicts. Mr. B, the "Golden Boy" image was sure to tarnish, for such is the nature of the film authority, but it is just as sure that one day will be restored, and when that day comes "You all laugh" will be recognized for fine work as it is.
