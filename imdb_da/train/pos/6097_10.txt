I can't see how you can say that Freddy's nightmare is cheesy and a rip-off. Of course you do not know good TV when you see it. The episodes are filled with drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's nightmare and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series is being sucked, you are right in your opinion, but remember that it is only your opinion, and that means nothing. Freddy's nightmare will always be one of the best series ever and you will soon accept that fact. If you don't like it, don't look at it, but don't say it's great.
