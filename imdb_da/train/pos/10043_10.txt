This movie re-wrote movie history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks of this movie because it exceeds criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easy to overcome by the many amazing things the movie is about to do. It's an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see something similar again. I've seen it several times than I usually count, and I'm still transfixed every time with a feeling that's hard to describe. One for ages.
