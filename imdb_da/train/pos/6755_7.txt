Ah, noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's follow-up to "Laura" is a film noir set in a post-war period in New York, where corruption and violence are raging. It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame the crime chief Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to reaching his goal when he gets involved with the dead man's wife, Morgan Morgan. Of course, in typical noir fashion, it goes downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> While the movie does not make an interesting camera or storytelling, it has a constant tone of fear and gloom. Like most large noirs, it is also great pace and sucks the viewer right from the start. <br /> <br /> Still, like most of Premingser's work movies, it's not something I wanted to see again. It lacks Wilder's verbal whites, Hitchcock's visual flamboyance or Welles' spatial experimentation. As along later work, "Sidewalk" feels a lot of a "clone" of what a noir should be, rather than something truly artistic real. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the film is nothing special. It's about a policeman who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal. In a scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little villain, the film flirts with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far as Otto goes or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. Nothing has been done to assign the camera anything. It does not play with space or architecture or empahsise step by step police procedural. It's just tripod set ups with occasionally dolly in and out. Meaningless, though most do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir cage), which themselves enter a vehicle lift (another cage) and are taken up in the top gangster cave. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto repeats the movie, constantly resembling "upstairs" to hell. This works well, but the set design fails to strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems to be happy to follow the hawkish mold of what a noir is, rather than playing with the possibilities of where no one can go. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lonely Place", "Violence Act", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", second tier film made noirs. It is competent and engaging, but lacks the extra special magic.
