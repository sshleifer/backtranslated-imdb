I watched this movie back at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005 and out of the 14 movies I saw there I would rate this as my # 3 movie. I had an initial interest in seeing that this was Swedish descent even with many of my ancestors who came from the Norrland region where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of ​​rural northern forests America where many small towns were much like the setting of this movie. It's nice to see more movies using rural places as their options as So as I Heaven. This was a very good movie, and I'm sure a very hard movie will pull along with its big cast, but director Kay Pollock really pulled this out after nearly two decades of absence from control. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress was fantastic, and I wanted to look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist at the head of this well-rounded cast. I would highly recommend this movie and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
