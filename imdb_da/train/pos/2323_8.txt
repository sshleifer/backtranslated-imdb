"The man in the moon" is a pretty good movie. It is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects. I wouldn't say the movie was terribly original, but what are these days? <br /> <br /> The cast members all did a good job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a good job. Jason London also does a fine job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant) a lot. At times he seemed to be the kind of father you fear, but in the end you can really like his character. The rest of the casting was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you are touching movies about growing up and managing what life throws at you, then you should see this movie. I would suggest reading plot synopsis and if it sounds like something you would be interested in, go to it. In any case, you hope to enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
