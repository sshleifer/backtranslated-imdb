I've loved this movie ever since it first came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27. I remember playing video games at Sega Genisis. I had so much fun I would love to show my son this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie just as I did when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than I was when I first saw it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Let it come out on DVD !! I die to see it again !!! Well that's my comment I hope someday I will soon see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini video is Badder!
