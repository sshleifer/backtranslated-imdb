This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original movie. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here they put "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space" together. The same as they did with the first movie, but with other episodes. But it's still a really good movie. Only the end is strange (you can't see what's happening with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. The actors and special effects were good. If you haven't seen it, you should see it. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
