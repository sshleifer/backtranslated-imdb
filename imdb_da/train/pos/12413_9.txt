History of a falsely executed prisoner pursuing the prison was galvanized and killed by casual prisoners while waiting for revenge on the man who hit him. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great and the play is pretty good. Lane Smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden. Also this movie has some good gore, including death with barbed wire mummification.
