I watched two movies over the weekend, One was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood", but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Comedy Hindi movies. His Casting of Charecteres is perfect. The story, apparently taken from a Gujerati Play, is great, the treatment is great with some exceptions. In Bollywood, when a movie is collected, the first thing a Bollywood director tends to do is sign up for a music director, and this guy (mediocre Malik in this case) is required to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah will use them to appease Finacier and Grandma who just can't get enough of these numbers. No music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie. None of the songs has any tune, and they are clearly intrigued by the story of the story except the background music and the westernized version of Bharat-Natyam. The dueling and role play The Father and the Son are good performances of Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good instructor surrounds himself with good actors, and he is willing to wait for a good story to come together as in this super film. Then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like Sharukh Khan who will bow low to shamelessly plug and promote a garbage bin as "Kaal" to enrich himself for the cost of Art and they surround themselves with borderline talent and they recoup The investment before the word comes around. These are Bollywood Grasshoppers who offer the unsuspecting audience to obtain "Film Farce" awards by Bollywood Chamcha and most of them are in the media.
