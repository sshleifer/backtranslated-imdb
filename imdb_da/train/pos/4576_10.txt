I thought this was an absolutely charming movie centered around Mary-Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make both themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it's just not that easy for them to actually do it! I thought this was an extremely charming and sweet movie, and if you are a real fan of these wonderful young ladies, then I'm sure you agree with me here! If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I say you really missed it; great time and that you should definitely take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
