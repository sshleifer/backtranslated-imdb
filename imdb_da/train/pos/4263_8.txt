During a Kurt Weill party in Brooklyn, where do we go from here? was finally excavated for a screening. It's amazing that any movie that has Weill-Gershwin collaborations might be missing from the screens. The result is high and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only emphasizes its significant benefits. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as director of this musical imagination, and Fred MacMurray cannot fully understand the material. The 'modern' segment is also weakly written. BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark, just like the two lovely leading ladies working - Joan Leslie and June Gardens. Both have the charm that this kind of work must desperately work. As World War II greets our country's history - albeit in a "never-before" frame, the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be accessible to anyone to see and find its great benefits.
