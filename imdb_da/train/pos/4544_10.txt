Okay, I know I didn't like this movie, but I do. From Pat Morita's gracious interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying scream, I laughed throughout this movie. As long as you consider that this is not the best movie in the world, it is a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita, who talks to her boss in Tokyo for a second.
