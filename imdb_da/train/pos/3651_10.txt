Pandora's watch is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. A high faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a frightening real scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for television, this is first-class entertainment. Cast is great and slides into letters from the novel so well that you would think they read the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps outside Macgyver's shadow and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is amazingly her role as an ambassador in a role that shows that she can be a great dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is amazing as Dr. Sanders and despite the fact that the character is a man in the book, it seems incredibly good. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the support aids are top notch and fit their new colleagues until he letter. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, changes in history (including and a slight change at the end), but these changes are better for the novel. The reason is realistic and looks a lot to believe in the way it presented to make this the best airplane movie since the original airport movie. The production values ​​are high and although the special effects can look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. Sets are great, especially the CIA HQ and Oval Office, which show that filmmakers spent a lot of time doing this work. It doesn't matter if you see this first and then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you won't regret losing four hours on this movie and how long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you breathing.
