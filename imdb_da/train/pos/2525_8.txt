Tony Hawk Underground came at a time when the series really began to lose its brilliance, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air as to what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the story, which was very cool because it created a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature introduced which fans really argued for, and it was able to get out of the skateboard, which is nice, because now you can actually climb, drive and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and it was the length of level design. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were good and long and some hidden features in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened due to a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems to their limits. In this version, they shortened these features, there are not so many people wondering about the streets, in fact there are almost none at some levels, and the graphics and skating physics are tinted down a bit, but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game has a con, the story is a little short, of course it is Neversoft's first time to do this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. But with that said, you will definitely end this game within a day. All in all, a fantastic addition that was very refreshing.
