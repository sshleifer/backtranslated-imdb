I watched this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old alone in my parent cellar on a Saturday night. It was shown at the "Chiller Theater", a regular scare that I saw religiously as a young man. Now I have seen many old horror films thanks to the Chiller Theater, but no one ever stuck with me as "Danse Macabre", "Blood House". I'm 51 now, and just last year I was fortunate enough to find a relatively new quality DVD version of this wonderful appallingly inducing supernatural classic, thinking I could never see it again. I've already seen it four times, and it can't seem to get tired of it. <br /> <br /> They don't make ghost films like this anymore. Haunted catacombs and haunted cemeteries just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day. Still, this Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously shady, cobwebs-wrap'ed haunted castle sets, restless spirits restore their deaths ... and an evil ironic ending. <br /> <br /> IMO, this is up there with Robert Wise's "The Haunting", "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and the newer "The Others."
