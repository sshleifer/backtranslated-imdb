One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected to the President of Venezuela in 1998, his support coming largely from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup deposited card with Chavez. At that time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, who shot a documentary on Chavez for British television. Their movie deconstructs the coup and its success and records historical history on the spot outside and inside the Presidential Palace. <br /> <br /> 3. The purpose of Chavez was to free Venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the United States. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was privately run by leaders Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains flooded with poverty, its resources literally being sucked by foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins by depicting Chavez's first year as president before the coup. It focuses on his popularity with the poor and his various policies, which proved to be popular with the working class locals (education plans, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution and urged children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute the oil surplus. Understandably, this made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private TV stations immediately began to oppose the state-run television station. They questioned Chavez's motives, hygiene and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without the media support, the coup would not have been successful. The movie makes it clear that coupons depend on the media to convey information and that the news can be easily produced. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the "Democracy Restoration" dam, the opposition plotted the state's television station, dissolved the National Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Political interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA), organized a mayor in the presidential palace to complete the coup. Snipers shot at Ch√°vez supporters, but the private media facilities edited recordings, so it turned out that return fire was targeting the opposition margin that had actually been relegated safely. <br /> <br /> 12. Police went on a firing ramp against Chavez supporters who continued the blood in the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Captive Chavez refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied and said he had resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members conveyed the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to Venezuela via cable TV. <br /> <br /> 14. The people rose and pressed for the return of the president they had chosen, which only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - In just over an hour, this document is too short. Nevertheless, it is an exciting piece of journalism and deals with some form of "media warfare" that is rarely touched. Make a great companion to the "Battle of the Algerians". <br /> <br /> Worth having a view.
