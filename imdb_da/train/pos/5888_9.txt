I could see this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. I wasn't sure if it really was a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both so wonderful - our picture of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since Aunt Bee! They are alive, beautiful and sexy! The only drawback in this movie was that there was no mention of other characters in either "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows from the 1970s. I would have thought that since it was put in New York City (where "Rhoda" had been put), at least there would be mention of her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would have appeared, provided of course she was still in the big apple. It is my hope that ABC will make this a series and bring back to the guest's appearance all the old casts of these shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS to do this reunion or a possible series? Wasn't the network carrying "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
