I rented a domino on a whim, not even knew it was inspired by a true story, and even though it is the least likely and true biopic, you will probably see. I found it to be pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly he writes a lot of plots and stories in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model facing bounty hunts that leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career. It has an edgy acid trip style provided by director Tony Scott. And with fast paced music and editing, it gives the visual flare attention to smooth performances and unexpected comedy. The film is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours.
