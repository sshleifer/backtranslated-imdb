I first came across 'My Tutor Friend' accidentally one or two years ago while television was surfing. Before that, I had never seen any Korean movies before in my entire life, so MTF was really the first Korean movie I've ever seen. And what a lovely surprise! I was thoroughly entertained from the beginning to the end and had a good time laughing. Its cartoon is quite different from the royal films in Hong Kong (which I've been accustomed to all my life and so tired of it) and breathe fresh air into my humor movie experience. I thought there are a few scenes and tricks in the MTF that are pretty hilarious, witty and original too. <br /> <br /> I saw MTF the second time a few days ago, and having seen it once, the surprise / comic strip on me kind of diminished. However, it has in no way affected my opinion about the film negatively. Instead, something else came through this time - it moved me - the story of how two young, apparently "enemies" who are completely incompatible, are thrown together, and how they gradually solve their differences and begin to fit each other without realizing the feelings even reminds me of the far away high school days. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are actually compatible, as they both have something that is pure and genuine in them, a quality that separates them from people such as. Ji Hons sassy girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two different parts - the first part deals with the "fight" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more fierce and faster in pace. After Ji Hoon gets a passport in his final exam and Su Wan dances (in Ji Hoon's opinion) provocative dance, things start to change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes he cares about Su Wan more than he could ever imagine. So the second part deals with the development of their common feelings, which, of course, leads to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang leader. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I think it's a bit incredible - that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" would be embarrassed to be almost naked in front of the girl, he bully and lose his "cool" is just a little ... odd. I think it shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy who is pure in heart and not really what his appearance works. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) Has a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite movies all the time.
