Back to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people leading Challenger lead to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil that threatens to destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to defeat the drillers, and the plateau is rescued, much to the natives. As in The Lost World, how few dinosaurs we see is made of rubber, and these include a T-Rex and ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner represent their roles as Challenger and Summerlee, and three of the other actors are also back. Despite reading several bad reviews of this and the cheaper rubber tinos, I enjoyed back to the lost world. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
