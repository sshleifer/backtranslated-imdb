The "House of Games" is certainly not without its misplaced holes, rigid acts, final scenes - but they do nothing to detract from the fun of seeing a thriller who so methodically messes with his head. "House Of Games" means almost everything a good thriller has to do. Of course, this is not a great experience as we are dealing with the confidential men's world and the disadvantages they commit. So that's why we never really know what's going on, even though we think we're doing it. But that's what makes the movie worthwhile for those who are games; a movie where repeated views are left behind, if necessary. <br /> <br /> It has a specific Hitchcock slope to it. The film draws on some similar themes found its 1964 action "Marnie", considered a misfire when released, but now considered one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea that Lindsay Crouse's character is the same as Tippi Hedrin's ... ten years later maybe. Both are strong wills, both with compulsive actions, forcing them to go too close to the shark basin. As Crouse's suppressed, tight character says, "What is life without adventure?" Put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!
