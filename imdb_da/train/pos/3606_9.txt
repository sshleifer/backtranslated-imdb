I really enjoyed the girl's fight. What I could see again and again. The action was amazing and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I can say very convincingly. The film shows how women should stand up for what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time. Taking care of an ignorant father did not help her much. Although he loved her, he was truly hateful. Her mother died when she was younger, and it also puts a little grief in her role. The love story was a part I really enjoyed in the movie too. I felt the passion that y had for each other. Then the drama sets in again and then it is as if she chooses between her boyfriend and her lifelong dream. I thought it ended up right. It was the kind of end where you have to decide what happened to them in the future. For all you people who like a movie based on a sport with a good plot, I suggest you check this out
