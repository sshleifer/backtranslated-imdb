Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while at the restaurant next to the lake. I watched this movie on a video I had the loss of the television. When I saw this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape then slowly stepped through the part that the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him to have a baby, so watch or lower the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit quickly.
