I have seen this movie many years ago and have searched for it since my opinion, although it is very raw it is very educational, what the future can hold, I enjoyed the movie and for this today judge the very sorry all of them who disagree but a movie must always be judged separately, and in my opinion it gives a great opportunity with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today, who are we to judge this movie, it can be a dramatized event of what is to stay, but there you go. All day's horrors have so far been fetched myself, I laugh, but this makes me think, and it scares me like a mother, what if I was desperate after watching this movie, I would think twice sorry but I love the movie don't make your own mind look at the film production - just tell the story and ask yourself how far will you go to a child?
