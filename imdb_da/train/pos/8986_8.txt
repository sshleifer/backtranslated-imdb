Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. To see him beat a song, if not an entire album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he is God, but is so legal and interesting. The DW is not as interesting in comparison musically or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" , Says Anton to the cameraman: "Well, we can ban this guitar!" Great use of archive / home video material. Great to see rock docs still being done. A cool doc about the creative process. If you like this, see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Out of stock! on dvd. A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
