What can I say, Ms. Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and as an Italian American, fan number one of female beauty, I can't forget this movie. <br /> <br /> You know, I really don't remember much about the plot, or situations or other actors. I can only remember about drop dead beautiful Erika and that in this movie she looks better than ever, I really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the wonderful moments I had been teenager in Brooklyn Just considering Erika's beauty. Just to conclude whether you are an Erika Eleniak beauty fan like me, this movie is for you.
