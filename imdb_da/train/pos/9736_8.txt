Pegg has had a couple of hits in the last couple of years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, movies on "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes this "How to lose friends and alienate people", which in many ways is one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes an erroneous magazine that makes fun of celebrity most because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Of course, Sidney is excited and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is currently writing a book and hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing and I hope more will come out like that in the near future. Once again, Pegg has given people everywhere another good movie, and I can't wait to see the third part of the blood and ice trilogy "Paul". I rate this movie 81%.
