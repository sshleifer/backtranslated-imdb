WOW. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> LOVED it! Before the opening was made, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a Sci-Fi thriller - and the edge of your Whodunnit seat. Incredible. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a throwaway role. Anyone could have played it. The leading actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me, who loved War Games, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
