So I don't ruin it for you, I will be very short. There are some great actors and fun lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate from Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks of humans. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girlfriend (Mya) left him for a job as a television producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris) helped Marvelously by his "creative partner" (Zoe Saldana) to bring him speed. They help protect his career and show him the broader opportunities that come from being a compassionate physician rather than a player who just wants to make money (which seems to be true for many of my friends).
