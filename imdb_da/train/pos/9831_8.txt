We have high expectations for this. . . because its Zombi 3 is the official successor to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However. . . it is co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Zombies Night) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Zombies Night) and his shot in Phillimines as Zombies Night and very similar to Zombies Night (Hell of the Living Dead). . as a result, it's more like a companion to Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi, gave Zombi 2 its magic. . . Zombi 3 is not magical. . . It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years I have grown to accept Zombi 3. I could swear that I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on his arm and went to the hotel room. . . there was a meaningless Fulci-cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut is the one on DVD.
