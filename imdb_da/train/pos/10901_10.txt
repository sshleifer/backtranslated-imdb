This is probably the best documentary I have seen for a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. Looking at minutes from his life long battle was heartbreaking. Listening to his clever ass remarks and seeing his adorable gesture was heartbreaking. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed for being touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever have a chance to watch this movie - consider lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
