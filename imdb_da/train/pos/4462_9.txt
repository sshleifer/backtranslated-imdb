One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh, features several memorable musical sequences that Kelly dances with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dances with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra sings with Jose Iturbi, who plays piano, Kathryn Grayson sings with Iturbi leading and more. Technicolor is perfect, with a new innovative camera work like watching a piano playing from below, through transparent keys and Grayson song, seen through the finder of another camera. The reason is thin, but you get involved in Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor is on holiday, they have to take home a shining boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls to his aunt. To put him up with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra's young and naive in this and in his own healthy words fall in love too quickly. While trying to contact Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall to another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now in love with Grayson. Anchor Aweigh is often remembered for the live-action / cartoon sequence combination with Tom and Jerry, but there is much more to it that is worth seeing. I give it nine stars because it's not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - It's one of the first of their class of Technicolor major productions (maybe meet me in St. Louis was the first one, and better than most others.
