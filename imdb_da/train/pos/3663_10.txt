Perhaps the last movie you expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the short story on which this movie is based). It's a neo-realistic fantasy, a kind of oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son. After a couple of years, the baby is a young boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to orphanage, and when he finally reaches 18, he leaves. Immediately he finds that he has no home. Toto is optimistic and will not let anything down. A man steals his valise, and instead of being angry with it, Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small town. Toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless who live in the area and they build a better shantytown. Soon the farmer is trying to sell this land, and the citizens of shantytown have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner assembles a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the movie becomes full-fledged fantasy (before that it was more comical / fantastic melodrama in Charlie Chaplin's style). These things are so strange and shocking that it is best for others to see it for themselves. It is amazing and very fun. There are objections you can travel about the Miracle plot in Milan, for sure. Fellini and Visconti were heavily criticized when they started rejecting neorealism. I think I read this was criticized a lot at the time of its release. At this point, it's so much fun - I loved it a lot. It can be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's films, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves come very, very close. 10/10.
