Timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top shape, stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli and great music tracks. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of the movies people see with a smile and say "they don't make them like they used to!" But they never quite did that. The climatic 25 minute musical order without dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. Movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. A must see!
