Arthur is a middle-aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes into his mind. He likes to boast of his wealth and knows he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he doesn't know and finds all the fun. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really strange). <br /> <br /> This is a wonderfully fun movie. I watched this movie because a very famous Indian movie 'Sharabee' is based on Arthur's character. Although 'Sharabee' is totally inspired by 'Arthur', I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one lines in the movie. It's not a grin, but it has some amazing moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets with his fianc√© father, and he continues to talk about 'elk'. Duddley Moore probably has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he speaks standing to a sitting couple at the hotel about a 'little' country, and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud received an Oscar for this film. I don't know the actor. I don't think he did a good job, but it could be if I looked more at his work I can agree on in the future. Movies have some flat spots, but not very long. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel.
