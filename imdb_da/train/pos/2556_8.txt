And one made for television movies too, this movie was good. The action in it and the plot was just as great. This one of the only movies I've seen that I felt combed because I was afraid Reaper was going to kill me through my computer screen after seeing it. There were just a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it is very easy to see. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. played an outstanding role in this movie with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie has just as much excitement and it made me feel better because I never thought a low-budget TV movie could be so powerful. After watching this, I read the novel, this movie was based on (four times) and it was also kicked. If you ever see this movie coming on TV, I would see it. The effects in this movie were pretty well done, I honestly don't know what a living calcifying person would look like, but with the way the FX team made this movie, I was impressed and all that shows is that all these bad ones made For television movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so badly. <br /> <br /> See it. It's really good, no it really is!
