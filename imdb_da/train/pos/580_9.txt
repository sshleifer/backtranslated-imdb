After watching the movie, it immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river runs through It is about two brothers, each taking a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and he is on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters, each of which follows their own path. <br /> <br /> There is no downside to this movie. You will be entertained all the way through. The action, direction and script are all perfect. The two things that are extraordinary are cinematography and the score.
