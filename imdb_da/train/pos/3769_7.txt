Oh, come and learn to have some fun. When I was a child, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy to me. I thought it was completely hysterical. One of the best movies I had seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoy "Excellent Adventures", you should most likely have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "Dude, where's my car?". Only one is actually fun. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously, and if you enjoy the first one, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a fun movie with some memorable characters. For only your enjoyment, see it, drop it, and remember it's a silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
