Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not arrive late or was even redundant. It's one of the few who is trying to handle the other sad side of the war: The Time After. Different from films such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo" who use to present their protagonists as broken heroes in a bad after-war environment, this movie allows the audience to see another view of the Vietnam veterinarians. Their development is certainly very precise before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragic there is always a sense of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the quiet Vietnam movie ever, but after almost 15 years, this is truly plausible and therefore justified. Moreover, it may make us believe that the war is not yet finished; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done one of his best jobs, but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Perhaps this was his best performance ever.
