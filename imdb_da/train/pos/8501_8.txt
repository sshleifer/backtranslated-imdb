I think it's a good example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a good movie to show in a sociology class. I thought it was quite fun, and I have to say I am a sucker to "let ties together and get the job done" plot unit. It looks like most people are not aware that this movie is not just a comedy. It also has a few dramatic elements in it, and I think they are fine together. Overall, I give it a solid 8.
