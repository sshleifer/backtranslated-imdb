An American in Paris is a showcase by Gene Kelly. Look as Gene sings, acts and dances his way through Paris in a number of situations. Some pure majestic, other pure corn. You can imagine what Kelly was doing when he made this movie just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is definitely one of the all-time greats. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only major difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in LA <br /> <br /> Some have said that Leslie Caron's play was less than clean. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally intended for the role, could have done better, but Caron is quite credible in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this movie gave it just what it needed, one that doesn't look like Gene Kelly. Filling the role of everyman is not an easy task, but Levant did so with as much class as any other leader. The song and dance routines are absolutely perfect. Even the oblong ball at the end of the movie makes it a better movie with it than without. Since in reality there was not much screen time to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem like you had spent four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I would have to review this movie with Singin 'as it is very similar in history and song. Singin 'would hardly get the nod because of Debbie Reynold's uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
