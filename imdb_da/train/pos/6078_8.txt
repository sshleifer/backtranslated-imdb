I was especially pleased that Othello himself was dark-skinned in this movie, and Desdemona didn't have any straight hair as almost always. The cast also played very well, and I liked the script after Shakespeare's original text. But I have to say that some scenes were too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest and so it is not right to show her to bed with Cassio - even though it only happened in Othello's imagination. In the beginning I was a little surprised, even though a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
