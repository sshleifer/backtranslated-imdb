This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s obsession with how evil metal metal should be. I remember being freaked out of metal teens when I was a kid. It didn't help that I found a dismissed grave in my hometown cemetery when I was ten. Turns out that this strange metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some strange sacrifice to Satan. So maybe things that deterred me from metal for a while, but I love it now as a 24 year old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD, which was used for 6 bucks, and I expected it to be sucked because of the lame cover, but to my surprise it ruled. It's about the extreme demonic force of metal. And you must love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and evaporates headbangers in the crowd. This movie is great if you love the 80s metal and bad movies this is for you. 9/10!
