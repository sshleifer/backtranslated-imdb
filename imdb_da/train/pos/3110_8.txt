The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) lacks a bit in the history department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi especially takes part of the time and makes this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) themselves agree that finding a story for the last part was difficult because the end of the second movie was ... advanced history. How did they get around it? The action scenes, for once, but they also did another thing that I can't reveal because it would be a spoiler. But if you see the movie than you will notice it! Funnily enough I read that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three movies .. if that matters to you: o)
