This really is an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that must not miss any fan of French New Wave or Underground movies. There are hardly any opening or closing credits - we have just fallen into the world of consumerism, revolution and youth. This film has a bit to do with documentaries and is more interesting to play with our advertising ideas and its relationship with reality. Lines of real and not really crossed in ways that are familiar with films that discuss documentary, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing, not to describe the real.
