This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into 2 groups. Those who get the joke and those who don't. People usually attack what they don't understand. This movie has a comic and charm that has been unparalleled since. It's a great comedy .. and a great romance. It's a perfect date movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good soft grin. And if your perspective is too exciting, this movie may not be for you and you may need advice. It is an injustice that Paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80s, as he has never seen the light of day on DVD. But they feel an Urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that my two very favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "World's Largest Law", which Fox has set since the early 80s. But, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost all video stores in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who took the time to bash this will enjoy "From Justin to Kelly", I'm sure you are enough water to "get". Sometimes, age people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes it just gets outdated and they find comic book satisfaction by restoring "Full House".
