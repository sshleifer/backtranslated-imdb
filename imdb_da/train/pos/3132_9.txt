I saw this last night with low expectations. The reasons are that I don't usually like "made for TV" movies and rarely have I seen "cast reunion" movies. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like this, so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward are reunited as themselves. But somehow, they acted as their "Batman and Robin" themselves. They were campy and didn't take themselves or this movie too seriously. The movie starts with those searching for "George Barris" designed Batmobile that someone stole before it was auctioned off to a parent's home. As they search for the car, they also respond to the series they did together. This is told in flashback. It was well done. The actors they got for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And for a television movie it became nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen. I give this a 9/10, I liked it so much.
