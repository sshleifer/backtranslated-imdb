The Unseen is made in a style more like old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show. The movie is a bit slow, but lots of bizarre pictures make it cinematic and lively. The basic idea of ​​young girls who are disturbed by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the film worth seeing. The film is known for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it an 8 out of 10.
