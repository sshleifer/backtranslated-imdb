This movie has an all star cast, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few, run amuck in Monte Carlo, as well as some other beautiful European places, and it's very fun. The problem that everyone comes into when they lie to protect themselves is great, and I strongly recommend that you watch this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in top form in Once Upon A Crime, which is everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a large family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives the star's performances, great plays, great comedy and good timing, which today is rarely in movies. Great plot, great mystery (which I love anyway) and generally, worth the money you spend on it. So get the kids, grab some popcorn, juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show !!!!
