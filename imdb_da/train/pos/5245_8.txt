I thought this movie was LOL fun. It's fun, not to be taken seriously, movies about a man's twisted view of life, love and ... good ladies "from the low bus station shank to the high class d√©butante ... bus station skank." Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a Playboy-style mansion by a Hugh Hefner-esquire grandfather, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" kicks him out on the street, he must learn to defend himself with the chauvinist outlook on life that his youth has taught him ... and an unbelievable, almost mysterious level of charm and stupid luck. And then the hijinx begins! If you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light heart, semi-mindless, comedy / love story, then I highly recommend hiring "Ladies' Man".
