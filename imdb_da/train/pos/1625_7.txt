A surprisingly good movie! It has a lot of good jokes throughout the movie. The only negative is that some scenes go to the extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, continue with it! <br /> <br /> The reason just distorts being called "corny". And boobies are always a plus, although the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card much, though the plot line introduces two black-haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it an 8/10, but let's not get mad.
