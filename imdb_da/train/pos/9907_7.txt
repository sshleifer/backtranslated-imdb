"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. It's one of the few movies in the genre that is enthralling all the way through. When it is said, it also depends heavily on standard slasher formula: A group of young men and women are killed one by one cruelly until the final showdown. The reason why "Slaughter High" stands above most movies in its genre is that it is more over-the-top. Marty, the murderer, has good reason to resist her former classmates. They electrolyzed him when he stood naked in a girl's shower shower jabbed by his step with a spade and out of it, rigging his science lab experiment so it could desfigure him. <br /> <br /> So, the victims of this movie are about as unlikely as you get. When they reunite years later - at a high school reunion put on by Marty himself - you realize they haven't matured so much. They are a bunch of sociopaths. It is overwhelming why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to meet up for reunification, which, moreover, is held in a school that has since fallen into disrepair. And who thinks it's a good idea to drink beer and spirits in the abandoned building in a room that happens with their old cupboards - as well as Marty's - on display? There are many steps of faith that the viewer must take to enjoy this movie. The conclusion makes little or no sense. And the writers have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works: The film claims that pranks are no longer allowed after dinner. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It's hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to DVD when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are adorned with special editions.
