I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. By far it was my favorite. The actors were very trustworthy. Alexandra Bastedo was just beautiful .... I only order the DVD (15 episodes). They didn't have superpowers. They had just superior human abilities (strength, hearing, vision). The 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very trustworthy. There was a good story in each episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions anywhere, so the manuscript was good and the characters performed were great. There were no fancy things like in other shows. They didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
