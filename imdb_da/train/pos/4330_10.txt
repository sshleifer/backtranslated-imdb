<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on display. Alway one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this TV mini series. The late, big Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg were pure perfection as the convicted Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, and it does not make any lesser cuts that do not affect history. over all a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
