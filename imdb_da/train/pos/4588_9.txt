Classified PG-13 for violence, short sexual humor and substance content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> I've seen the Police Story a couple of times now. In my opinion, the Police Story Chans best movie from the 80s. did it because he didn't like the other policeman he had to star, where was the protector. I haven't seen the protector, so I can't compare. It's not that bad, and the plot is pretty good. I don 't remember the plot well because I watched a movie a little back but what I remember is that this movie has lots of good actions, stunts and comedies just what a good Chan movie needs. If you can find Police Story and you are the Chan fan then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtime: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
