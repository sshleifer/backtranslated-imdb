Now this is what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage. WENDIGO, while occasionally defective, is a fantasy of the imagination. Granted, it leans heavily on the EVIL DEAD style camera moving for its mood, but it's still a marvelous sight better than 99% of direct to video dross. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple: a family takes a vacation at a remote hut and is threatened by a particularly unhinged hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build excitement and adds layers of disturbing creepiness through the use of the mythical Wendigo. Is it real? Is that all in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have confused that the movie is unsatisfactory because it is left to you to decide. Don't be put off by such invisible fog. A movie that makes you think is not one to be avoided. It is one to rejoice.
