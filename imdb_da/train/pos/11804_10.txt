Rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now that all my friends are looking for a fun movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It must be said, though there is a rule that was made that made the film so much better. No speech is allowed while the movie is on unless the word Sasquatch is repeated in a song. I also loved the credit at the end of the movie. "Thanks for Jeep, Tom!" Who Tom is, I thank you because your movie may not be made without your jeep. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, maybe look for something else, but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey package, take yourself a copy.
