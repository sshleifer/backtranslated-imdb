First, I'm a big fan of the 80s movie, and also by Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday I walked into a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read my back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 it was a bargain. So I took it home and showed it to the VCR. What a sweet movie! In my age I am more involved in movies as if last night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. We all have the small crushes when we are younger And if that doesn't work, we are heartbroken and we believe That we never get over it. But of course we do it. Often. It's the kind of sweet quality I really got from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember that when something like that happened to me ..." is all through it. The characters are interesting and well-developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies, especially teens movies or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
