It was amazing! Photography, editing, filmography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the pleasure of "slumming" without going through the danger. We were there! The dream sequences and the flashback sequence ending were fresh. It spoke to me. Continue the good work! Another of that genre is the city of God. Also - don't laugh! - Comedy, desperately seeking Susan. Beautiful ensemble types with great performances by everyone. Sorry, I think the training day also fits that genre, with amazing performances by an ensemble cast. I had to switch channels on some of the gritty sequences, but all in all, a great movie!
