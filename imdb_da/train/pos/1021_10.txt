The first and second season began to shake, with good episodes that had melted in between the average and sometimes resort to clich√© stories. But once it began to build the universe in which it existed and began to develop the sign more, it became much more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this show is the success of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry humor looks much better, Peter's directing is excellent and makes an episode so much more entertaining, and Joe & Paul never fail to make a fun, interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> When you understand what the show is about and know the characters, I doubt you don't like the show. For those who enter the show, I propose the episodes 'The Other Side', a good serious episode and the 'Window of Opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.
