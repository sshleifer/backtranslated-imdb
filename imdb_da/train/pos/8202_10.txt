This was undoubtedly the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening circles you are celebrated in a revenge story that hits hard and is deeply inviting. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman for revenge. Eastwood has many "side" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but shows Harry at his worst best. Loaded with unforgettable characters in smaller roles, this movie clips and should act as a standard for detective / action flicks. This is the one Dirty Harry flick that is raw and devoid of any "fluff". I can see this again and again (okay, not in a meeting) because it is a pleasing "out of revenge" yarn. The pace is fast and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "Go ahead - Make my day ... You feel lucky, Punk? ...." Classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with its horrible, rubbery expression and whisper, threatening voice can do it.
