Nice character development in a beautifully cool environment. Being a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It's not as bleak as it really was, and the treatment of women was probably even harder. What makes this a wonderful chemistry among the protagonists. Each has their own "thing" that they contend with. When they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to tie a lesson into us. The people who work without profit are really nicely developed people who are going to see the light. I had a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character with such an epiphany so fast, but in this world it had to happen. Good deals with something positive that takes place in the lives of some very good people.
