Well, since before I watched this movie, I was really not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong was I! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen for a very long time, a true family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' father, this movie marks all the boxes. I haven't read the book (maybe it's a good thing and meant that I liked the movie more), but in terms of history, I really can't think of any bad points and thus score 10 out of 10 (and I Hardly ever seems something guarantees top marks!). When William proclaims, "I can ride my bike, dad!" I sucked my heart out (anyone who's seen it will understand I'm sure). Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.
