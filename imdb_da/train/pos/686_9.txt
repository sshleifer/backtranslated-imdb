Ghost Story (TV movie - 1972) was a pilot for the NBC series. The film was well-written and well-acted, and I thought when the TV season 1972-73 started, if the TV series is half as good as the film, NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video !!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as exec. Producer. However, if you have a chance to watch the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
