Once again, I looked through the discount video bin and downloaded this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty-five percent of the time when the movies I find in the box are pure crap (I mean terribly convinced), but half of the time they seem to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than expected. I found it very engaging, although of course it was made by an amateur. The direction is nothing special, but the story is exciting with some good tensions. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not so disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Normally, these movies require all four of these elements. The PG value is well-deserved - not as "sixteen candles" where the "f" word is used twice, and there is a short, free naked scene. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could have been more developed. The movie tends to be plot-heavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up with a careless three-minute assembly of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The Dream Machine" is no gem, but it is good, pure entertainment. It is completely forgettable - especially with a caste of unknown, except Haim - but it is also much better than one would expect. My score: 7 (out of 10)
