Whoever said that horror was not an educational film genre, huh? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, I at least never know to offer a foreign guest any wine and a piece of bread with salt in my own house because he might just be a hypnotist and this combination will give him the strength to control my thoughts and mind forever! Thanks Hammer! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another I have been looking forward to seeing, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the UK's finest filmmakers, but unfortunately underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer movies, like "Vampire Kisses" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some overlooked independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to the House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex but fascinating plot outline and twist on lovely occult themes. The plot is centered on two antique dealers who stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror, but it is actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon Choronzhon; The demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is highly sought after by a satanic cult as they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it until one knows the real value of the device. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who runs from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael gets deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cultures and female victims of young women are typical British horror subjects, but David Fischer's manuscript is never boring and offers lots of nice plot twits, among which a very inventive climax. There is also plenty of excitement to admire, the dialogues are white and the performances are amazing (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is really vicious). Recommended!
