I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not just for the rocker Luciano Ligabue's fans, but for all movie buffs. Because it is sincere, moving, fun and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a movie lover, and every frame of his movie is made with love and care. Because his characters are beloved and pray to be loved. Because most Italian debut movies are miserable, and one, made by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful and talented and good and lost her life because of the heroin, the league shows it as impossible and ugly without indulging in easy morals. Because it is a movie that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived with the FM radio experience, and that was exactly the way. Thanks, Luciano!
