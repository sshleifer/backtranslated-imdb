It's hard to categorize the movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt to a movie of his own length. The movie adaptation is very true to the original book. The Indie approach to how this movie was produced is probably more effective than having a large Hollywood studio that finances it. These days, I doubt an intelligent novel that Mother Night will ever get the green light from the big Hollywood gates. And usually it is too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a tight direction and a solid casting. Nick Nolte, who seems to get better roles when he gets older, still has the "everyman" persona that allows him to take on a wide variety of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she came out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little air time is not the best role, even though the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Still, this movie is quite entertaining and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical reality, one can comment on the dating, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the events unfolding (I speak to you, fellow Americans who are students and score the lowest in industrialized The world of geography, history and master knows what other topics!).
