This was a typical class B movie in the 1940s Hollywood and yet it far exceeded expectations. Why? It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Lady May Witty as a female villain of all people. <br /> <br /> When a young lady answers an ad to a secretary, she definitely gets more than she negotiated. The only talents her employers seek are those that will lead to her death. Seems that Vittig and MacReady will pass her as their daughter-in-law and wife respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and will also make Foch see that a body can be invoked. <br /> <br /> The film deals with how Foch is trying to get city people to believe in her and how she is counteracted in virtually everything she does. Why don't people think of her?
