This is not just one of the biggest Jackie Chan movies, but also one of the greatest kung-fu movies all the time. <br /> <br /> We've come to expect crazy stunts and quick creative action in Khan's movie, and this set the benchmark for others to follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment that impresses all the way through. <br /> <br /> In addition to the amazing action, we have a viable story and credible characters, where Chan takes what appears to be a more Western approach to writing, blending Eastern dissolution methods (ie, kicking ass). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's fun, serious, entertaining, and groundbreaking. A must for any kung-fu fan, while being accessible to the wider range of the film association.
