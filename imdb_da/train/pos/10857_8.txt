Johny Til makes one of his best style exercises here and makes a strong film with a good Yakuza's story. The choice of the new Yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war in the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the violence is cleverly applied in the context, making a very strong band movie. I especially love the way he tells the story, moves around all roles in Yakuza's family and makes us see the violence as the only way to solve their problems. Talking About the technical aspects, the film is a good example of a paused, rhythmic and planned way to shoot a movie. One of Hong Kong's films this year. Are like infernal affairs, but without the easy action-violence scenes and the confused history. Highly recommended for all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my english, better do in spanish lol)
