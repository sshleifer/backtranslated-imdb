This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / movie author Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet, the appearance of a theater game transformed into a feature film is not one of its value. A masterpiece you should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles and not called). <br /> <br /> In an old bus en route to the capital Belgrade, a threatening war decides the behavior of passengers. Two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life, but also predict a tragedy to come; their song both shares and links stages in this extraordinary road movie (the real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but along with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who is plowed off the road, gives it a life in reality). <br /> <br /> The spectrum of characters provides an excellent picture of a society facing a war, an insight into the nation's collective person: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin but they are trying to live their own life as best they can, hoping that ignorance can avert the tragedy. Using a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of the society torn from previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits successfully: a singer's provincialism, the inexperience of the newlyweds, the severity of the great warlord at way to visit his newly modest son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in its narrative, with memorable soundtrack (especially the Gispsy songs) and tuned atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction to a series of directors' bittersweet comedies that will define Serbian filmography from the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako samsistematski unisten od idiota" and my second director's favorite "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
