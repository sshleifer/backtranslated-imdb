This is one of the greatest love story movies I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but it does not derive from the movie. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of time. Charlie Chaplin was clearly boring with the "Sex in the City" standard. But when he was judged by the prominent 1925 America, he was amazing. Likewise, Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its appearance for a mixed race love affair, American "apparent fate" arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step for such films as the gentleman's agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, but it is entertaining and enjoyable with countless lines that you just can't forget. <br /> <br /> But even when taken only as a love story is amazing. Although some are attacking Brandos accent, he is at his closest best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (both of which won the Oscars) and the rest of the support shot add a lot to the movie. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a great job that makes you feel the passion she has for Brando while being beaten by her sense of commitment and loyalty. Her talk, when she first meets and talks to Brando, is a classic and rare if ever matched in the cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in her changing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is just as good. Of course, it does not have mouthwashing, spitting and worse, which exemplifies love in today's movies, but it makes it all the better. It depicts true love and passion, and not just "warmth". If this movie doesn't touch you, you're just too young, for cynical or death.
