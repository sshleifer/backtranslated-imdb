Coming from the same director who had made "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that it's a good movie. Ironically, the "Papierhaus" is a movie I have never heard of so far, but it must be one of the best films in the late 80s - partly because it is down the worst movie period in recent decades . (Not to speak of Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The action is not brilliant, but only solid - contrary to what some people here claim (they must have dreamed of this "wonderful play", like Anna) . The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together nicely. These unanswered questions are probably left there deliberately and leave it to the individual's interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with it with a theme like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's movies and horror, with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-clich√© ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl, but a normal, normal kid; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of authors who project their own misfit-like childhood into their books and on the screen as if someone cares more about seeing or reading about another miserable lonely childhood as if everything is there or as if that kind of character background has a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (for the right stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and entertainment - as she was supposed to be only 11, but predictably it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they did not upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. It was quite clear that Burke is not so young. Why directors always throw children older than what they play, thereby diluting realism, I never know.
