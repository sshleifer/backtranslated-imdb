This is one of the most soothing, relaxing and beautifully made animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not only great for kids but also adults. It teaches you lessons that never forget who you are, you can do what you stick to and brave and bold. This movie can make you cry at times too, which is always a good touch in movies. This movie is fun, sad, sweet and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling when you see them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of spirit!
