I was totally drawn into this and could not wait for each episode. The play gave life how emotionally a missing person in the family should be with the effects it would have on the closest. The only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was "explained" at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part was all about? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go with it? Having invested in a series for five hours, we felt cheated that only five minutes were held back to the conclusion. I have been asking around and none of my friends who saw that it was also wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something crucial ????
