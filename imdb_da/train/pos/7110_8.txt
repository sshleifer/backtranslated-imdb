John Garfield plays a Marine blinded by a grenade while fighting at Guadalcanal and learning to live with his disabilities. He has all the stereotypical notions of blindness, and is confident that he will be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his burnt marines cannot get through him. Nor can his girl come home from home by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fear, self-pity and prejudice. It is a complex role that Garfield bears remarkably in a fantastic performance that keeps one to look in spite of the ever-present syrup melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he is in a machine gun nest, trying to ward off the progressive Japanese soldiers in a hellish night fight and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself going down a train platform with a white stick, dark glasses And holding a tin cup, all the time his girlfriend goes back from the camera.
