I enjoyed the movie and would suggest anyone just out for a good time. Don't take the movie too seriously because remember it's Disney and it's rated G. It's good fun, though some parts can be recognized by adults, but children will never feel, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella's faithful Valet Alonso. Glenn Close is amazing and has really made Cruella her own and is credibly scary even when she is "cured" of her fur-cutting ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills, who literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping in my seat when she caught you in surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loves Ella.) All in all, I want to see it again in theaters, I found myself enjoying it so much .
