While the film's premise is rather lama (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a gracious and fun little flick. It's also a darn bit better than the movies they continued to make after this - probably since this was the last Hal Roach-produced Laurel and Hardy movie. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see any of their last movie, as whole chemistry is lost in these movies and the boys play their parts exclusively for pathos - something true Laurel and Hardy movies would never do. They had suffered an edge that all the later films lack. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work at a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly with all the racket, Ollie is getting a nervous breakdown and has to take some free work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the team) recommends a sea voyage. But they do not like to sail, and Stan has the idea of ​​just renting a boat tied to the quay - so they can get all the air they want without having to worry about! When they are on the boats, a dangerously escaped criminal goes aboard the boat and accidentally goes out to sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was well paced and the final end worked really well. <br /> <br /> Although not a full-length Laurel and Hardy movie, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting music (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would hardly notice after this movie. Part of this was due to the boy's falling health (and the increasing circumference of Ollie) and part of it was due to the general ignorance of these later films.
