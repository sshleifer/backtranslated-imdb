Had never heard of The Man in the Moon until tonight on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like everyone else, eclectic. My favorites run from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to Ghost and Mrs. Muir through the Wizard of Oz and the beloved, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Within. The man in the moon is extremely made, a gentle heart, joyful and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors really live at present rather than acting. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral surroundings. It is hard to remain stoic during the last moments of the film, especially when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart hurts private pain and forgives everyone. <br /> <br /> Instead of pampering the enjoyment or drilling you to sobs with my dull prose, end up with this suggestion from someone who enjoys movies who speak from the heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you buy no other movie, please buy the Man in the Moon. This moving story is one that you enjoy reliving time and again. It's a joy and a gem, a movie too scarce in this world of hardening hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that evinced in Man in the Moon are a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
