I encountered this show for the first time in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird, but I found it great! Koyuki showed such conflicting characteristics, and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I voted in! I first saw him at "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked him much better in this! Although the characters are interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed to find out that they didn't change much over the show. Their relationship grew, but they didn't really work. Anyway had a fun time by everyone (even for Fukushima!).
