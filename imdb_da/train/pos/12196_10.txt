Orson Welles manages to hit me on my ass with every picture of his I see. The Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. The reason can often be confusing, and sometimes it seems to be moving a little bit too quickly (about an hour of it was edited as test screenings went bad). However, it does not matter. You can't see Welles' movies and manage to concentrate too much on the plot. His direction defines the right direction. Almost any scene from this movie can stop any other scene he instructed. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I cannot stand them. The point in point, try to sit through Welles' own speech near the end of coercion. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in the courtroom. See the jury that always sneezes and interrupts the case. Or just look at the lighting in that scene. I know it's just a simple blinds and that it was always used in the film's nodes and crime film from the era, but Welles gives it a beauty altogether. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime film with examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he spoke Shakespeare or spit out hard-boiled lines, it had the power to touch the soul. 10/10.
