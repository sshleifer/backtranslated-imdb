A kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done, and Polanski works well as the diffuse introvert trying hard to adapt to his sniffing Paris accommodations and his other lodgers. Scares early because of the seemingly average and self-employed colleagues tenants and horrific later as he develops his defenses, which will ultimately be his regret. Personally, I could have done without the cross-dressing element, but I accept the node to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, in terms of history. Nevertheless, it could have worked without and would have removed the somewhat theatrical element, but perhaps it was the intention, because the courtyard probably looks like a theater at the end. I can't help feeling that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a "real" Frenchman and Jewish to start. Still there is plenty to enjoy here, including a good performance from a beautiful look Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters are as reliable as ever.
