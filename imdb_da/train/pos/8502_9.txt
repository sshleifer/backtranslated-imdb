Gung Ho is one of the movies that you will see again and again. Michael Keaton is responsible for awakening a Japanese car company to get to his city and thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is a fun moment after another. The two cultures collide and it is up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for good performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. Everyone is perfectly cast. Don't be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the city name Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
