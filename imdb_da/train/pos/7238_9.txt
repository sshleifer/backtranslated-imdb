Small SPOILERS alarm !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say it myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires, and the sound of the director's name Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good performance when no famous actors or big budget were involved. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. The Sarafian illuminates another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains fairly loyal and true to the truth. It explains the life of Romanian Count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army away by spitting dead bodies in front of his castle. Of course, reality stops and "based on a true story". Blood drinks and things were all invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the counter (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the United States and seduces tons of woman. And they are all beautiful girls I give him. All in all, good performance of unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local video store. But it is definitely worth cleaning the dust on the cover and putting it in the VCR. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing else in common, but I blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this lovely little picture. Check it out ... my humble opinion of dying for = 8.5 / 10
