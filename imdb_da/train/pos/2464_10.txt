One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We do much in the church, and it is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting as a "must see". There are several scenes of note. For one, the cemetery scene when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about this scene by just going to primary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I assume a testament to Shakespeare more than anything else. For a second, I greatly enjoyed the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character of Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel.
