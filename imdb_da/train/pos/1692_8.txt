Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at various levels. I just introduced this to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. Both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times ... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times ... adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get just because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated things found here) keeps the movie as fun for adults. For example, by adult level humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different movies / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has Jack Nicholson's voice and manicures; the scientist, the Dr. Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the favor of the movie, and the actors / actors play their role well. In fact, I would say that the producers choose actors and their skills for the role of the role compared to the cashier example is Wayne Alexander's "Protect" character). I had to write this review ... kids are playing this for the third time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a sennat weekend there is nothing on and I'm boring movie.
