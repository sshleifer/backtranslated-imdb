I caught this movie on my local movie channel and I enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good teenage movie, and more - this film, besides dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like, also deals with the issue of steroid use of young people. <br /> <br /> The movie has real life to it - no loud music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - as for this movie was right. That feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie - some of them we know where we live. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
