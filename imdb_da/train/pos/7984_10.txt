The man on fire is definitely one of the best drama / criminal thrillers I've ever seen. Despite a slow start, the story is so incredibly complex and sensitive that it fits well together. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role in playing a body guard, called Creasy, who is afflicted by his past and is an alcoholic, but never gives up his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very clever, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and acts in a very convincing way, she has a good future ahead of her. As I said, the story is somewhat complicated, to fully understand it, see it a few times. <br /> <br /> This movie is made in two parts, which is the first hour where everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, everyone just lives their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy almost gets killed. And then there is the second part, the rest of the film, where everything suddenly becomes too complicated and somewhat cruel and disturbing when Creasy has returned from his serious injury and begins to chase and kill the many criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. Denzel Washington shows us his most up-to-date acting talent along with many other talented actors who have a good future ahead of them. It's a shame that this movie hasn't been recognized enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his accomplishments, and so did Fanning and the director. And maybe even the visual effects that were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent, slightly awful, exciting thrillers, this is where to look. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10.10
