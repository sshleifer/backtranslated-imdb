What is the best way to start reviewing a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I have just come directly from watching this movie, and the images are still deeply burned into my brain - and I don't think they will soon move. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea what kind of movie this is, even if you haven't seen it. If not, let me warn you that this is not a moderate budget gem that has been lost in a couple of years, a la "Near Dark", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, "fun" B -movie. What is the low budget art made in a simple but sharp way. The idea is a simple - seven stories that revolve around and end in suicide, which distinguishes between recordings of a destructive body. Sounds simple right, even boring? It is not. Words cannot really describe how powerful this movie becomes when you are halfway through; It almost draws you into it, whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I was shocked here by the technical advantages and disadvantages of the direction; Perhaps point out that the scenes are apparently shot at super-8 cameras and are sometimes appalling. I can point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way to compete with any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day everyone seems to be pale to a negligible degree. <br /> <br /> As far as extreme movies go, I've seen the hardest of them, yet Der Todesking has moved me in a way that few others have succeeded, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that I would consider "free". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I do not want to ruin it just to say that the character's emotional pain almost falls off the screen and makes you sympathize, if not longing for its end. It is probably not the best movie ever made, and in many places it seems to be raw and perhaps a bit amateurish, but despite these mistakes, Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. If you are a person who likes pleasant viewing or "nice" movies or just wants to brutal on something brutal and pointless, then this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you're enjoying it or not, it's one you don't forget about.
