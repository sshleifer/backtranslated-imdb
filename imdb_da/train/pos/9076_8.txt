This would be one of the funniest television sitcoms to get out of the states since the end of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always fun, and in this, the rest of the ensemble complements the cast. David Spade continues to kittle my fun legs tremendously with his very unique delivery of his lines. Having raved over the British series "Coupling" I can see from where the creators of "Commitment Rules" got their original idea, but it is not meant to be a "brick" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in as it is transferred, this series sets apart completely apart. But it requires more than a competent draft to bring success to a new series, especially in the very difficult area of ​​comedy. Having participated in a professional TV comedy writing team in the best part of 7 years in Australia, I especially appreciate the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few complaints I have with the series is the obvious "can" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.
