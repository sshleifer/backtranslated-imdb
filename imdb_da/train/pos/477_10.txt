Hello all i am chess enthusiast since the age of approx. 6. I assumed I was quite obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character of this movie. In this movie, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of stepping back, he simply went out of the tournament hall, never to return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the central character in social character is a treat of some of the more serious greats you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess, I suppose, is a very big victim and you can sometimes be unbalanced in other areas of life. A big example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although he was a genius, he was also greatly disturbed in many ways. In the film, a World Championship match is depicted, as between an Italian grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which is really the world that has control over Fide, sometimes employed as a format itself - ranging from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also shows a realistic format where the winners in each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before interruption makes it a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. In fact, I've made a youtube video about it so you can explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Regards Tryphone
