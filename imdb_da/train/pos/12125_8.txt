I watched this movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore that part of Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood. Considering that <br /> <br /> at that time can not appear much on the screen, [not much in the novel], the occupation of the character with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well communicated to the audience. I recommend this movie to anyone who ever fell to another person, and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to record the novel for sale, but when he started studying, he started crying and couldn't finish more than a few lines and the whole project was chucked. One can tell the novel is written from the heart and the movie is a good <br /> <br /> adaptation of part of it at least.
