I'm not at all concerned about horror movies, and I'm willing to see virtually any of them. It does not mean that I am willing to see many of them again or that I will not criticize them. This movie is scary and it is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would make an excellent double count with session 9. <br /> <br /> I should state before I get to my comments that I saw this alone. I started to see it before I went to bed and got about. 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, so I saved the rest of it in the morning. Even while you saw it in broad daylight, it was still scary. But I cannot prove how effective it would be when looking at a larger group. After the death of their daughter, a couple moves to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. Let me draw attention to this death - this is one of the rare films that are not shy of the child's death. This is much more important as it both sets the tone and explains much of the play that permeates the movie. The couple are not doing well. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the man does what he can to try to bring her back. While some of the comments have complained about their performance - one stated that they appear more like a father and daughter than husband and wife, and that is legitimate. He tries to give her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes take on. <br /> <br /> There are a number of scares in the movie and most are rather non-violent, but grotesque in some ways. The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the movie and takes an odd turn at the end. While the turn is not absurd, it is certainly not what you had expected from the way that had happened. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something that seems to have been shot on video.
