I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I saw this as a child and absolutely loved it! The scaffolding is brilliant and you can really empathize with this guy because he is treated like an outcast. Good humor and amazing kung fu this movie stone! If you like Kung Fu you would love this !!!
