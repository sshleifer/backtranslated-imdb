The only part missing in this movie is Shue's role as the daughter who wants to follow in her "moster's" footprint as a daytime post. Otherwise, it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that every actor enjoys their parts and overcomes to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the manuscript - I have to ask if a small ad lib 'ing was not taking place in parts. It was well molded and there are some classic lines that stick to you. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, everybody should see at least once. I would recommend not drinking anything that will stick out of your nose. <br /> <br /> You will definitely want to see the last scene carefully, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret, she would rather not have shared with you. <br /> <br /> If you love daytime laps or despise them, poker this step in all the right places.
