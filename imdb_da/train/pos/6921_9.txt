Remember, I'm a fan of the genre, but have recently seen this movie for the first time. How I have overlooked it all the time is a wonder to me. For me, this is a better movie, so the very high "High Noon". It is a great western with excellent plays and a great story. The DVD is beautiful black and white with excellent filmography. If you like westerns or James Stewart, don't miss this movie.
