See it is Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a film about a dead girlfriend joking the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who had "sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. If you are expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie, consider re-viewing movies. But if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, then you've come to the right place. The characters are all fun. They work well together. The right match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is as fun as he was at friends, and she was fun and looks great at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and I did too.
