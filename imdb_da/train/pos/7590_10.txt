I don't care if you want my comment or no, but I think you write that the movie is not good. You're so obsessed with Hollywood's movies that you can't see how good this movie is. I'm not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his game and not just his ... and maybe you think there's not one great feeling in the idea and maybe you think it is not so interesting but looking deep out there is more than action in movies more than love and passion and tears that are more than the USA in the world and that is good :) really good. And it costs a lot to do so please do not criticize the actors, the directors, because you do not know how hard they work for you to be happy in this one and a half hour to see them thank you :)
