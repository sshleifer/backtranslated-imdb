German private TV is poorly known for copying Dutch and ?? of course ?? American formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxing only went as far as the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can't stand scrubbing technology? Don't see Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect another lawyer's drama thingy similar to law and order or something, go somewhere else. (Or see law and order as it is absolutely brilliant on what it does, but I go out.) E&S is fun, often addresses thought-provoking themes, is also fun, romantic, fun, fun and witty. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm totally horrified, the authors didn't get better deals after the show's last. And my cynical nature must adjust itself: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I am talking about. <br /> In short: See it. I do not have the most clever what the English synchronization is, but hey, it is worth learning German just to see them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
