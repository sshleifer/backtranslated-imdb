My love for Chris Rock varies with his movie, I hated him after deadly weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie after it. I like him when he is himself and does not hold back as in Dogma. Well this is his best yet, didn't expect this to be as good. Leaked my ass all the time. Chris Rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for some time. Loved it.
