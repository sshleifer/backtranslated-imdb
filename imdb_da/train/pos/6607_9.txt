I would almost give it 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are rude, harming the film's flow / continuity. The story is big and well composed; You will certainly want to see this quietly to fully understand it. The characters are complicated and so is the story line, expecting to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a movie where everything is explained eventually. The animation is amazing, and the combination of femme fatale and film noir results in a fantastic movie that is unlike anything else I've seen in animation. It's a black and white movie and its quiet darkness in a few scenes, so it's worth looking at a good T.V or plasma. The character voices store this movie in its English version, but it would have been more convincing whether there were any French accents to emphasize that it happened Paris, I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles. A whole is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And even if you liked this movie, you also like it; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
