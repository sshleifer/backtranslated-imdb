Unique film about confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with sharp wives. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group. Absolutely enchanting first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse's "ropes" of his con game. Story Line unravels a little later, but still stands as a unique depiction of an innocent trapped in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
