I saw this movie every chance I got back in the seventies when it came out on cable. It was my introduction to Harlem who has fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) since then. I was still very young, and the film made a big impression on me. It was great to watch a movie about other young girls who grew up, trying to determine who they would be and making some bad choices as well as good ones. I was dazzled by Lonette McKee's beauty, the great dresses they eventually got to wear, and the cunning dialogue. As someone has also grown by a single mother, I could really identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem almost real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
