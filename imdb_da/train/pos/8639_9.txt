I have to start apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was fun. It's mainly because of Brad Pitts performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The act of everyone involved was quite good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every respect. I'm not a huge pitt fan, but it must be one of his best roles ever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read a previous review and the person said the reason behind Early's violence is not explained. It is explained, but fortunately, they do not have to go into graphic details to get their point across. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this a 9 because each scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Underestimated.
