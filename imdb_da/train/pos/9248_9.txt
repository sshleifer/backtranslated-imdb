Keep your husband found Jean Harlow, the working class girl from Brooklyn who falls for con man Clark Gable and comes in all sorts of problems. The movie starts out as its movie, but at the time it is over weight, it certainly changes to her character. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Gable, pulling a street con-game with partner, Garry Owen and the brand shouting to the police. When he is chased Gable Ducks in Harlow's apartment and because he is such a charming guy, she protects him. <br /> <br /> Before long, she is involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to draw a badger game on a drunken Paul Hurst, but then Gable won't go through it. Of course, when Hurst realizes it was a cone, he is still wounding and becoming warriors and Gable has to knock him out. But then he wins dead outside Harlow's apartment and the platinum blonde hair makes it easy to identify. She goes up to an accomplice to the gang. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is her and her adaptation to prison life. Her interaction with the other female prisoners gives her some very good scenes. I think some of the material was later used for MGM classic Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets the title song, and it's made like torch style ballad, very popular back these days. She talks / sings it like Sophie Tucker and pretty well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well cast as the king who develops a conscience, a role he often plays, especially in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. Harlow is going to shine in this movie. I think it's one of the best she did at MGM, and her fans can't miss it.
