I had heard some not for good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that is why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV, and since I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, I had difficulty finding something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen for a while. I was amazed at how I was hurt to see it. It's hard to explain, but under the film your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's going on, and it's a very emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or media for that matter. I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Whatever you heard about it.
