I love this movie. It's one of the movies you can see over and over again, and you still find it interesting. Congratulations!! I think everyone involved in making the movie, and the script must be proud of itself. It's so scary you want to see a real life band. I'd like to see more movies like this one. I'm glad they didn't choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably wouldn't work. And while Billy Connolly is quite well known, he really got stuck in the role and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. Congratulations again, I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ..... well what can I say !!!!
