This film is about a fictitious soap opera. It's very fast and fun. Saying something else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and subplots in the movie. This movie has the ensemble cast with today's hottest stars. They all give the best performances. This movie is my favorite from the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daycare soap opera or prime time soap opera !!! If you see soap go check out this movie it is fun !!!
