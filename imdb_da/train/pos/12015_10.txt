Think first of this movie would be your typical western movie, but it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway," 76, had previous experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall," "93, and Zach never forgave Sam and stopped nothing to secure him and paid him Sadly, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of a Lady", 96, managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex-haired men who never seemed to leave her alone. and I was totally surprised at the conclusion, this is a very entertaining movie and the play was excellent.
