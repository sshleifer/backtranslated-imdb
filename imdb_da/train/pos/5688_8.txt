Opening credits: large. Music: Just for this movie. Cinematography: Sleazy to great effect. <br /> <br /> Harrowing excitement in a train wreck kind. It is true that some lives may be out of control. "Wonderland" depicts drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how it really happens in our society. It's better than portrayals of another wild group - Mansons - because all Manson movies, books, etc. Concentrate so much on Manson's crazy mind rather than the overall picture of cheap fame and coincidence that's so transparent today. <br /> <br /> To see some of the best "Method Effects" on movies, watch Kilmer in this movie. He shows how the "method" can rivet in the right role. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers here succeed in raising "out-of-control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us cheap excitement.
