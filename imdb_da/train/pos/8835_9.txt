A sharp political commentary that stands as a forthcoming age story is what this film is. The annoyance is that it works effectively on both levels. It should not, but it does. This story of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 Communist Belgrade is a heart warmer. It's called gentlemen as a classic cinema. Obviously, 1953 Belgrade is not as hard as a dictatorial and fascist environment, as communist society is often portrayed. You can listen to rock and roll music. One of the songs being played is the song "Hey Babu Riba", the title of the film. However, jeans cannot be purchased or certain substances that are illegal to possess. Contrary to a powerful criticism of a communist society, this film does so by showing how it affects the lives of the five main characters who refer to themselves as four. The girl, who has a father in exile in Italy and awaits a passport to her mother and she has to leave to join him, the piano taken away from community operation by one of the boys, the sudden release of your home and neighborhood to your new friends because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it is clear that they despise the fascism that communism has created when engaging in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed on his hands. These all lead to the actions they take later, and the memory of a time that falls away when this film was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Union. A great movie worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but still there are no friends."
