I watched this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it. Then again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the stupid, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she's today. Anyway, this movie really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendships. How far will you really go to your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when I see it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater I called my best friend and talked to her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. But be prepared for the almost safe conversation afterwards, where she turns to you and asks if you want to do something for her ...
