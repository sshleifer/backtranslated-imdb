There are two things I like about Elvira and they are both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered: her joke and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show off how fun she can be or how she commands attention. Like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the property of a distant relative only to discover that she is truly the occult heir. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been much more scary and chilling. It's mostly a campy fare with so many bad horror movie references in it as the rioting mob or the fugitive heroine who travels and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her amazing gifts to break the chains and keep her locked in the cemetery. The end is sappingly sweet as if it was written by Brady's, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too big for this type of movie.
