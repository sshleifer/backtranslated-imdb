"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-functioning tale of a scammer who steals (whoops! - too low a word for a scammer according to Peter Ustinov's protagonist) a "hot million" from London's branch of a US company by creating shell corporations on continent and use the company's seemingly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, police spoil, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) From 1968, this movie's depiction of computers may seem naive to today's more computer-literate population; But as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released, I would argue that even when it has been successful in writing computer illiterate occasionally, it is likely to intentionally increase the trivial comedic aspects of this British flick. <br /> <br /> If you have a little taste for this type of entertainment, the film may appear to be stained. Fortunately, it has a nicely wrapped end; Finally, the final credits do not give any indication of the classical music used in it - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano whistle in the middle - only the song that was sung by Lulu, which I cannot quite remember.
