This movie was entertaining but for the wrong reasons. Coordination of the action sequences is ridiculous and causes the movie to have some fun clapping moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson tells Ginty, "You are sure to come with friends!" I only enjoy this movie for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the story that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines, and the rest ad libbed probably. A movie with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems strange that no one else has a credit in the movie, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. The only thing this movie has on its way is that it's pretty violent, so it tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty making a movie worth seeing.
