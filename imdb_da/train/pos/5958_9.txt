Unlike some comments, my positive. This movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you don't. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not a smooth, happy with everyone and everything, the type of life - like real life. Some story lines do not develop, they just happen. But as true families and good friends, they hold together. They want to be parents who buy a baby, is such a - gaps! You're happy with the end. Bad Delmar is stuck between a stone and a brick that takes care of herself, her mother, her son, and tries to keep all their lives together. This does not end with a sunset tour or a 'burbs' house, and everyone lives in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month. All in all, it's a good story and a great movie !!
