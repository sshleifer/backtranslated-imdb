This is the epitome of adventure! The villains are utterly wicked, and the heroes are refreshingly clean. Danes, deniro and pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan. Excellent performances, great magic, fun and dramatic, and a perfect adventurous ending make this movie amazing! I am not so sure that all content is appropriate for younger children, but for an older audience there are lots of hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do this movie justice! My fianc√© and I were quite skeptical, but were so excited that we had taken a chance on this movie that I can only hope to secure someone on the fence about this movie to try it!
