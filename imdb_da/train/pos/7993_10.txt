There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality whipping Latin America with regard to the kidnapping value, the police corruption on the continental level, among so many realities, that we live the Latinos. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy continues to be an excellent actor and continues this way. Dakota Fanning just after 10 years is an excellent actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they've done to those who produce Hollywood to make a movie entirely in Venezuela where they show our reality better in terms of crime, drug security or political issues. They've got the movies they play Venezuelan country (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) they had to do more, as well as they do in Mexico. The song "Una Mirada" I hope it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10
