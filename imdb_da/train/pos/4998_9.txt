Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, delivers kick-kicking martial arts action in spades in this exciting Hong Kong movie and shows that like her brother Brandon, she is a true chip from the old block. There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast-paced flick and the decision-makers in the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quota for the next 007 adventure, as there are very innovative things here with some fresh and original second entity works to strengthen the already high action content of "AND NOW YOU ARE DEAD". When you watch a movie as fast and entertaining as this, you begin to wonder how the cinema itself was able to survive before the martial art genre was created. I really think that movies in general and action movies in particular just marked the time for the first kung fu movie made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action films and his legitimate survivor offspring Shannon does not leave the family name in here. Although there are several pleasing appearances in this movie (Michel Wong for one), it is Shannon Lee that you will remember for a truly spectacular performance like Mandy Hitgirl Supreme.Hell you can get away whistling her battles!
