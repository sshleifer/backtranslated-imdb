This wonderful little movie has all the elements that made Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few .. if not the only .. femal composer to work in the genre Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very bad for the day!), and beautiful scenery and set (everything in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors perform amazing jobs - with truly outstanding performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most crucial role of a woman in a spaghetti western. Outside Cardinale in Leones "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Without sending any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best conclusions of any movie I've ever seen!
