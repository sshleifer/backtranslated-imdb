This movie is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but for his family. I can't start telling you how to tell my little girl that Dad was going to Kansas City to cover the Priest Holmes and Kansas City Chiefs. She would think it was the coolest thing Morris's son did. Living dreams with the family is what this is about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
