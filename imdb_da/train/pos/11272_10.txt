108: Tarzan and his friend (1934) - published 4/20/1934, seen 8/6/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde kills two highway patrols in Texas. BIRTHS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After we were slightly disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered among other users and historians that the second movie, 'Tarzan and his mate,' was the best in series. It is true. I got a big kick out of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular wing-swinging, expensive dueling wild superhero, and Maureen O'Sullivan represents his role as his amazing lady love Jane (who wears a two-part clothing for the first and last time here). In my review for 'Ape Man' I stamped on Jane pretty well for her obsession with clothes and her uninterrupted screaming, but she has redeemed herself here for me. Don't make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most accomplished character in the whole role. She works as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can work perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to treat an angry pride when she is out of bullets. She even got her own jungle scream now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She has completely trained him. Cheeta is also quite charming, pulling Martin's cigarette. The reason is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the jungle's most evil animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, but always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the naked swim scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action / adventure, nothing holds a light to 'Tarzan and his mate.' The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass, violent and risqu√© jungle epic. I doubt that in the future there will be another Tarzan movie that does not take prisoners as such. You would be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code approved or approved by Animal Rights for that matter. The cruel violence does not even expect the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes the boundaries of today's fairy-tale movie. And after T & J has entered the picture, there are plenty of early morning sledges and night-time toboggan runs. See it yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this movie. In the first movie, Jane seemed like a walking contradiction, as the authors again did not know how to depict a character like that. But here she is a good precursor to the kick-butthunner of later cinema. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of most jams, she does much more than just wait to be rescued. Her personality is completely trustworthy for a woman who has lived (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I saw this with my mother, and I enjoyed pointing to her how much Jane has Tarzan "trained" as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She has the monkey on her every dandruff and ring. While there is a wealth of dated optical effects throughout the film, there are still plenty of hair-raising Tarzan vs. predator fights being performed (mostly) for real. That and the men-dressed-like-monkeys are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie climaxes as the jungle outbreak with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two people still breathing. Although the couple rides into the sunset reunited and victorious, I can't help but imagine how this story would seem for the next safari that will hear about the former group of people who went to find Tarzan and Jane and became never heard from again. ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bother me is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth, hairless bodice and over-styled coif. Apart from that, this pre-Code action adventure is definitely not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It happened one night (1934). Next film: Twentieth Century (1934).
