I would say it was time, this movie was great ... and yes, if you don't want to be a Christian, why bother to see it. I saw this movie after I had already been rescued and found it very moving. I see now that they have taken these movies to a different level and have created the Left Behind series ... they have a close comparison and are absolutely modern to reach out to people. I think to actually judge this movie, you should see it ,,, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie itself! ! God will bless you if that's why you see them.
