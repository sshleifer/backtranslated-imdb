This film improved my opinion of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a few high-falconian European terms!), This film allows him to stretch (albeit a little) as an actor as he plays an unobstructed social climbs with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The molding is excellent; The story is moving fast and while it is not particularly profound (it may deliberately lack the ability to make social comments about the massively uneven distribution of income in that time), it is surely entertaining and satisfying. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also quite faithful to history. I also really liked the great depictions of the 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there is little not to like about this movie ... much worth the time to see it.
