Esther Williams gets her first post MGM lead and goes out <br /> <br /> to a great start. This movie is a well-functioning entertaining excitement <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that will be repeated a million times more in the future - innocent girl stalked frightened women's hatred. Esther <br /> <br /> looks good, and if she wanted to, it could have gone further <br /> <br /> making more and better movies, but according to her autobiography <br /> <br / > largely abandoned work for marriage. Whatever she is so <br /> <br /> sympathetic and engaging in the fun of seeing her in a completely different role outside of "swimming musical". Universal was great at <br /> <br /> making movies with former MGM stars after the studio began to drop its biggest names as it began to slip down the hill. Stars <br /> <br /> Lana Turner, June Allyson and others needed to make quality first <br /> <br /> price film at Universal, as of course they still had drawing power on <br /> <br /> ticket office. I wish Esther had made more, but since she didn't do it <br /> <br />, this makes it more special.
