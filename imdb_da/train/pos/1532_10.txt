This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows that after a stressful day in school sitting down in front of the TV watching. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame, it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is fantastic as Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor-turning detective who, together with his son, solves murder. He is affiliated with a largely unknown, but very competent support art, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I've noticed that every series of her hairstyle changes. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and was amazed at how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with great guest stars, it's a bit obvious at times like Colombo, but in every episode there's always something to chuckle about. In conclusion, a large series of two thumbs and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
