It's hard to tell you more about this movie without destroying it. I enjoyed it because I didn't expect what I saw, but an ordinary sex drama so .... It is a pscyho sexual thriller where nothing is what it seems. It has Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and to nudity), where her husband, Polanski, had instructed her. And a creepy performance (I said scary / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It seems that a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), as a Chabrol went wild or Clouzot thriller (I've seen someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans Visage (eyes without face, godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just afraid they'll blow this into a Hollywood remake they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
