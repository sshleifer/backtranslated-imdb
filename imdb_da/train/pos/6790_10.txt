This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist It is actually more entertaining than anyone else because of the combat system (you damage the enemy depending on how you attempt the attack, you can turn into dragon, the special attack, the magic ...). The script is very good. Characters are all lovely, and you have no long-standing dialogs to support, as it did in several games in the Final Fintasy series. I became bored with the dialogues about past when you just want to continue with the game's story. Ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines medieval fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It is noteworthy that animation effects are just incredible, I like them more than others in other modern games (we can't remember Dragon's Legend being 8 years now). Then the card is big, there are all kinds of places an enemies. Finally, music is not the best game mouse I've heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
