I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies, but heard it was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. Breathtaking. Brilliant, sweet, fun and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as it is to write and correct. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together, you really think they're a couple. <br /> <br /> The movies take you right away and don't get away. You can't look away or you can stop listening to them. Even the small moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has jumped into the line of one of my favorites ever. A masterpiece.
