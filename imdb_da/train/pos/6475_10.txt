It's just 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, silver screen or even in reality. As a writer, it is so good that it is almost demoralizing! As a viewer, it's so entertaining that I'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of Monday to Friday. Obviously, all these negatives are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I'm a modern guy who previously turned from TV dramas. In comparison to movies, the television drama always seemed to be dated, rather tame and good, generally boring! "Five Days" has really brought television drama into the 21st century, so for me at least it's fun to change. Go see it.
