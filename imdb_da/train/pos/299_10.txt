Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really good movies, and they are all the best. The cast could not be better equipped to play this light, but a little bittersweet scrubbing comedy. Interestingly enough, the witty, light touch Bogdonavich so effortlessly gives the job that the movie is a fairly disarming emotional core. Fresh and instant, the movie starts with absolutely no explanation. There is no soundtrack to cue us. We meet the characters in action, and as Bogdonavich slides down the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures it all with an underestimated simplicity that seems to be random, but it's certainly not. The cast is amazing. In every way, a classic.
