Words are not serious enough to convey the emotional power of this movie; It is one of the most scary you will ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, tender and emotional accomplishments you could hope for. Every actor in every role is amazing, especially a clever and underrated Jamie Lee Curtis, a close wound and attacked Ray Liotta, and a heart attack from Tom Hulce that should have gotten him at every price in the book. (He is number 1 to 1988's best actor in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars.") The last half hour borders on the melodrama, but the movie each serves its own tears - and unless you're made of stone, there will be plenty of them.
