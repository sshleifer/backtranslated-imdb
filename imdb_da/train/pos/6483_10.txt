This excellent series, told by Laurence Olivier, must say brilliantly, mapping the beginning to the end of 2. world War. The origins have not been fully explored from the fall of Germany under the hands of the Versailles Treaty, which helped induce Hitler's demonic rise, but as a reviewer says, it must be difficult to do in a 26-part series with so much to climb. <br /> <br /> Apart from the expected combat photography / action, there are lots of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told to give the viewer a great insight, especially if you are not necessarily another world war buff / fan. Episodes showing "testimony" and what life was like on the home front of the largest allies / adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, were completely eye-opening. Shows the extreme savagery of war on the front line and of course the citizens, the death camps, etc. Of course, very well handled and exposed. I would fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (one of which I can say is 47!). <br /> <br /> Certain things are quite oddly omitted, as the emergence of new jet era begins with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and Gloster Meteor's battle debut as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V-1 was seen debut and there was surprisingly minor mention of V2. This is probably a little oversight that does not refer to the more sensational secret and amazing weapons that WW2 produced from a more barren old science. But a big series that made its mark and has done it ever since it was happily repeated. <br /> <br /> A series to own as a box in historical terms, on DVD to anyone, especially as it happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
