Anarchy and lawlessness rule at the top of the podunk hick village of Elk Hills. The city's oldest depicts the hard, cagey Vietnam veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance of Kris Kristofferson) and several of his companions to clean up. The plan gets angry when Aaron and his cruel comrades decide to take over Elk Hills after they've beaten all the bad stuff. It's up to Aaron's decent do-gooder brother Ben (cheerfully played by Jan-Michael Vincent) to stop him before things get out of hand. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage whips up a wonderful amoral, cynical and vicious subversive redneck drive-in exploitation of the contemporary Western winner: he accentuates a gritty, no-nonsense tone keep the pace lively and unflagging all the way through, and phase the rich action scenes with significant muscular aplomb (the bursting explosive climax is particularly strong and agitated). The first-class cast of well-known B-feature faces constitutes a great asset: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet hottie girlfriend Linda, the amazing Bernadette Peters as flaky salon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the feckless mayor David Doyle as a slim bank president, Andrew Stevens as a friendly gas station companion, John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the "Nam veterans, Anthony Carbone as a smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as a folksy old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a mean strong arm shakedown bully and Dick Miller as a talented piano player Moral: Don't apply to other people to do your dirty work. ‚ÄùWilliam Cronjager's clever filmography, Gerald Fried's lively, harmonious hillbilly bluegrass score and the abundant healthy violence add to the overall unpleasant fun of this unwarranted neglected little doozy.
