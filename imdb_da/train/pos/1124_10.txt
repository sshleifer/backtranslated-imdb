I agree with all the acknowledgments I went through a box of tissue that sees this movie. It had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way. The issue I am about to travel represents a current sensitivity to animal treatment. I had a very difficult time with the beginning of slaughtering sheep and goats, and the dying deer with its pulsating neck and collection of blood when its life was drained away was horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the age of "no animals were injured in the production of this movement." Iphigenia was made in the late 70s before the advent of computer simulation. Was it possible to fake these animal deaths? Or were these animals slaughtered for art?
