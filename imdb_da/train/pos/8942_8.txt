A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think the difference did not affect a tension drama like Vertigo, but it does matter to a romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character would be attracted to her, but it is less clear why her attracted him. <br /> <br /> The film still works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him over the cat's head, with her dark painted eyebrows flaring and the sound of her humming and cat jumping, is true magic. It is therefore a bit gravel when the scene changes to the top of the Flatiron building, and we see the age difference very strongly. As he encloses her, she climbs her fingers through his hair, but stops the movement and just brushes her fingertips toward his toupee.
