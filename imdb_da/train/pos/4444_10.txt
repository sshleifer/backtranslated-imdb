Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since it is not connected to the first two demons movies. And with "Demons III" in the title one would assume it would. The problem is that this movie was never supposed to be part of the Demon series. The distributors only a "Demons III" over their original title "The Ogre" to deposit on the second movie's popularity. The new American DVD release of this image has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" on visual art, but the film itself says "The Ogre". I don't know if previous releases had the title "Demons III" on the film itself, but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. If you can get past "Demons III" in the title, you might be delighted with "The Ogre". It starts with a crawling intro, and remains pretty creep throughout. There are no gore and movie films slow, but I still dug it. Don't expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans have to try it out.
