I was drawn to this movie four years ago by my French actress. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour I sat in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, which hates this movie, hates myself and even hates the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened, but I was drawn into the movie in a way I hadn't been this year. And it was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke, and they had to make every transition by hand. I was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I think big movies are pulling you into a world, making you part of it and then letting go of talking to your friends about coffee or a drink. This movie did it. It was one of the best movie experiences I have ever had. <br /> <br /> <br />
