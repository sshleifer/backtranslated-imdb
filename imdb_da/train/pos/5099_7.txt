The only reason I came across this movie was that it is on LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD, and I recommend watching it even if you don't like it and the better known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a king and his companion. The movie starts quite easily, but becomes more dramatic when Coop first plans to use his daughter to extort a considerable amount of money from her brother-in-law, but by meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be exposed to with her brother- law chooses to keep her. But he has trouble keeping himself on the straight and narrow road, and then the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good, and Shirley still steals the scenes she is in. There is little music in this and Shirley has only one song. But it is entertaining and worth seeing with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
