Personnaly I really loved this movie and it moved me especially. The two main actors give us such great achievements that it is ultimately very cordial to know what has finally happened to their characters. The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and the song is as good as they are. Therefore, I did not feel surprised when I learned that it had won the 5 Golden Globe Awards (the most award-winning movie at Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A great movie that has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to be involved in it, probably as "co-director"). Her art is the greatest, and it will surely delight you!
