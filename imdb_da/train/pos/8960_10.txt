this cannot be war and peace, but the two Academy noms would not have been imminent if it were not for genius James Wong Howe ... this is one of the few movies I have fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in what it gives fictitious or not, BB & C is a visual celebration. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best work, I'm no expert there for sure. But the look of this movie is amazing. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, retro-downtown ness; But the way it was put on film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above and the "special effects" that seem to lag behind. It all creates a truly coherent world.
