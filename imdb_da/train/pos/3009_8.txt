A movie that is so much a 30-year-old Warners movie at a time when each studio had a special look and style for their production, unlike today when it is just getting the audience, the object is. <br /> <br /> Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and high efficiency while creating quality, working methods that were highly demanding for a director at Warners, a studio that was one Of the "Big Five" majors in this era, produce quality films for their large chains of theaters. <br /> <br /> Although we have an upper class setting on Long Island, the generic Warners style is embedded here with a tale that could have been "torn from the headlines". Another example is when the photographer comments on the girls' legs early in the film, and she notes that "they are not the trophies" give the film a more working man, to the ground feel, for these were the audiences whom Warners was targeting in the great depression. (Ironically, Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have done something like this very cheap and without the Polish and great talent) Curtiz has created from a excellent script a movie moving at a fast pace while holding the viewer with large camera angles and quick editing. <br /> <br /> Bring the sky, there is no fussy love-interest under-plot, so the fun can just keep rolling together.
