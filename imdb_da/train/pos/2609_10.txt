I am writing this 9 years after the final episode was broadcast, and I am still on the way from the impact Wildside has had on me. In fact, how many other cop dramas have gone and succeeded. But it took it further and was not removed from the giant's realism, which often portrayed life events and signs down to a T. <br /> <br /> I almost miss this series, instead we got the stupid "Underbelly" who is over dramatized and acted on creating a whole lot of American esquire waste. <br /> <br /> Wildside was true to the unique in Sydney, and for that I am really guilty of this wonderful series. The action was A-class, and it is a shame to see that only a few actors have pursued their career while others have faded into obscurity. I don't want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of their TV story, so I ask ABC to release the full series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
