This movie is an entertaining, fun and quality movie. The film follows the guidelines very wisely, if the book, and tries to adhere to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be that part. They use some famous actors that have a great effect on the movie. The graphics are a bit risky in some parts, and there are a few mistakes in the whole movie. There are, for example, Nothing like a yellow spotted lizard. The camp is not as cruel as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the progress of the camp as much as the book. His whole group is mentioned a lot in the book, but is not in the film. Overall a great movie for a rainy afternoon
