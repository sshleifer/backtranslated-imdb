For me personally, this movie goes down in my top four at all times. No exceptions. James Cameron has repeatedly proven that he is a master historian. Through movies like Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and trusted instructor as far as action and science fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But the Titanic is so much different from his other strokes. The film is exceptionally moving and provides space for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famous voyager sinking on his maiden voyage is the legend, so the challenge was to make Cameron a truthful, interesting and entertaining movie about it. The action is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who play Rose, became superstars overnight with the release of this movie, and in most movies I get annoyed when the supporting characters don't get much to do, but in this movie, it is more purposeful because, as an older Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it is quickly clear that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally, it is quite satisfactory and cannot leave a dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's best soundtrack ever and evokes so much from film and audience. The song after so long has become annoying, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this movie is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue that is memorable, but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points, but all that is set aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of life. My heart will not continue from this.
