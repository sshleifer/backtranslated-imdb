a film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating as only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some of the actors are extraordinary, see for example. Maria Hofstätter. The director has tried to portray life as realistically as possible and succeed. Coherent, the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than in a hard core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence, I found the films 'vision in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding, because with the double half losing the actors' great work. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate with a doubler. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
