An entertaining and content film, Non-Stop, has earned deserving comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly evolves into a hunting sequence from which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. Chase does not serve as a fast pace, but as a journey that makes up the bulk of the movie. During the "race" we see the signs grow and are currently forgetting their sad lives, the "macho" roles they have bought in, and finally forget why they started driving in the first place. Like the fighting, there was a "clarity" of the characters in "Fight Club" that run giving the film's character a means of stepping away from the false values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. Their run serves as a way to truly taste life from an unclear perspective, and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in the process. My encouragement and enjoyment waved little at the end of the movie, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to return to expel the false macho roles I thought they had fled from their journey. <br /> <br /> Still, the only true problem with this movie is that it was not distributed outside Japan earlier.
