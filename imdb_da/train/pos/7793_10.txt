My brother brought this movie home from the rental shop, and I remember that it was such a drilling. I think the title especially struck me. I can never remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother take it back to the store. It is very rare for a movie to speak to me as it did. I was totally trapped in Ruby's situation as she tried to make her way through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so fast. I could have watched for hours. Another drawback is that I have been unhappy with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She's so perfect in this movie. This movie is easy in my top ten favorites all the time.
