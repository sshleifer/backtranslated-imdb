It is always satisfactory when a detective packs a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case, climax gives me even more joy. To see the alley grin dried out by Abigail Mitchell's face when she discovers her victim has left the "deathbed testimony" that leaves no doubt that her guilt is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Please understand: while admiring Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting a simple "little girl" action that is embarrassing in a woman of her age. Worse, she has now set herself up as a judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband. <br /> <br /> When too close, Columbo tries to remove him by manipulating him to make an off-the-cuff talk to a high-class ladies audience. He turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and human speech about the realities of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect for not doing his job well. Here's a situation you can't see out of Mrs Mitchell!
