At first I was surprised that a TV show protagonist could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I'd give it a shot. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and look forward to Wednesday evenings just to see it, so next week I see it sometimes more on my DVR. The colorful characters, witty scratches, quick dialogue and new unique situations draw me in and catch from the beginning to the end. Down and Chuck Charles' relationship is interesting to see as they work their romance around that they cannot have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cod's character has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She jumps me up! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to, and cinematography gives me the impression that I see a movie rather than a TV show. I have recommended my family and friends to turn on "Pushing Daisies" and they are also hooked !!! The show is worth waiting a week for a new episode, and if you haven't seen "P.D.", I highly recommend seeing it!
