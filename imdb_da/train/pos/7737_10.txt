If you're so big of a fan of a writer like I'm by Jim Thompson, it can be quite risky when their works are converted into movies. This is not the case with Scott Foley's rendering of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. An exciting, sexually charged noir classic that follows closely and does great justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward may provide the best performance of their career. And the ever-phenomenal Bruce Dern could even exaggerate himself with this one. Like Thompson's book, this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes the logic, and the double cross is never far at hand. One must watch for all fans of great noir movie. **** !!!
