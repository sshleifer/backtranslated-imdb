No Strings Attached Features Carlos Mencia makes stand-up that makes us laugh and think. Not only does he pop fun on racial problems (like many hats' claims), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women think when they say they will be treated equally ... why Americans are more crazy than Arab terrorists ... why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he is doing in heaven ... a theory of how traditions began Easter display of the movie Passion of Christ - and his subsequent argument with a woman about whether he is influenced by Jesus ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not. <br /> <br /> He never stops reminding us that we all have a voice. So we must use it to speak the truth, say what we think, and not be afraid if others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
