This movie is amazing as it explores storytelling and imagination in the same way a child would, for adults. The idea of ​​a child's drawings becomes a place that she can physically visit and influence is wonderful. At the same time, you can make every child psychologist say it and say she is really exploring her subconscious, just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The piece that gives me goose pimples is when her father is in the paperhouse and chases her. The only thing I can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really isn't. If you want to see something British with lots of history that keeps you guessing without the usual cheap excitement, most movies should use so watch Paperhouse.
