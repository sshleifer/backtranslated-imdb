Extremely tense thriller in urban chaos in São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. To make it easy for anyone who is curious about this exciting and truly well-liked movie, it has the Mexican function "Amores Perros" with a character not so far away from Max Cady, from both Cape Fears. not in any way a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to their third partner (and majority shareholder) in the construction business. The murder is blamed on the city, but things start to look very bleak when witty and charismatic horizontal nightmare Anisio decides that he wants to be around the still nervous partners in crime, not just offense, but more importantly detest the strict social codes constitutes the Brazilian community. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude, and he wants it. The look is almost completely handheld, grainy, outstanding performances throughout, especially as the first-time actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, dazzling and baffling the viewer with his beautiful fun social terror. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie at Brasília Film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
