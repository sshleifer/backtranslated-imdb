Fun. Sad. Charming. It's all words that flow through my head while I watched this beautiful, simple movie. It's rare that a movie really moves me, but "Shall we dance?" achieved it with grace to save. Repeated humor mixed with occasional subtle pain made it easy to become one of the best experiences in my movie viewing history. It left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a little bit of sadness mixed in. <br /> <br /> And the dance, oh yes, the dance. Although you are not a lover or cannot put one foot in front of another, the steps shown here will breathe and enable you to enroll in classes as soon as possible. It was quite enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama (stylishly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) made steps when he first learned to dance, was delightful in a humorous, childlike manner. And yet, this film did not just revolve around dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and emotion. We are witnessing a shy man who learns to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love of art and the personal growth of each member of the wonderful caste. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love of life and small agonies are here, expressed with the delicate sense of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
