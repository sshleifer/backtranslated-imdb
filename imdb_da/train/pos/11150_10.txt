I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" thinking it would be another overstated '60s / 70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the 70s in the same vein as Midnight Cowboy ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many many overrated as well who have got a strong reputation among critics to be groundbreaking - unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not go as well today. I feel like "Easy Rider." (Although it's also one of my favorites.) <br /> So I didn't expect much from "Midnight Cowboy" but got a lot back. It is a moving story, well-made and well-written with some of the best performances all the time. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a little fun at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - perhaps because of the Lenny / "Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is quite convincing. Half of the film's budget went against his paycheck when he just became a big star in Hollywood. Unlike him, the other image is Jon Voight as Joe Buck, "cowboy" traveling north to the Big Apple in the hope of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive paths come to him in trouble and he mates with a crippled scam artist named "Ratso" - who offers to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of the profits. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long in two hours, but never really looks very long. Some movies may tend to draw, especially some of the movies made in the 70s, because (as has been said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"), the directors were the stars of the films in the 1970s, and sometimes they got a little too horrified with their material, going on too long to examine signs / scenes / etc. this is not important. Almost the only scene I felt was a little too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the movie seem extremely outdated (looks like drug odysseys in "Easy Rider") and really damages the flow because it's not necessary. <Br /> <br /> Apart from that, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost flawless movie picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (flashbacks are a bit sticky and never used as good as they could have been, for example) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie scene), but if you can handle the content "Midnight Cowboy" is a really good movie picture, an uncompromising study of life on the streets in the late 60s / early 70s. It is a depressing movie, yes, and according to today's standards it may seem a little outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of "life is terrible, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the extremely touching end will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Recommended. One of the best films in the 70s. (It was technically released in late 1969, but I still want to categorize it as a 1970s movie. It also won Best Picture Oscar, which was the first and only X-rated movie to do it. later rated R in appeal. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
