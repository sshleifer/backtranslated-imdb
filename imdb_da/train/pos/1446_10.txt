Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimature for top notch cinema. It's as good a performance as he has ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its relentless effect on the people who think they are running it. Not only is Pacino's performance convincing - it's incredibly powerful because of the dead child's funeral. The movie has a quick, greedy realism that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This excellent portrait of the big city policy also manages to provide two hours of beautiful film show without unnecessary violence, overheated sex or boys' language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my enchanted belief in Hollywood. I don't award many tigers. This deserves it right!
