I have NOT seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) I actively seek a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The dissertation migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had no GPS and only an old-fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their journey was quite heroic. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
