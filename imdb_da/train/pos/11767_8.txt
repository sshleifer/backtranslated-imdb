What a great movie! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists. James Belushi is very good as an ex-hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who will defend gangsters, hillbillies his wife and local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jump on board and enjoy the trip. 8 out of 10
