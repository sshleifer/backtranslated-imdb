I don't know if I would recommend this movie to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily feel some things about this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is the same, editing is just as scary and fast - which is good because, apart from making the movie more dynamic, it hides some flaws caused by low budget and other factors. There is much more to do, less eroticism and, as far as the "Meatball machine" is concerned, the transformation of man into a creature that is partly a machine (sounds familiar?) Called "Necroborg" (very original), caused by slimy little aliens. <br /> <br /> These slimy outer space scums actually use humans as ships for their gladiatorial games that they play with each other. They attack the body somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts into what is apparently pulling them out of nowhere and making it a killing machine targeted to other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, tear it out of the body and eat it. All in all, the plot sounds a bit silly and I don't expect much, but at the end I actually enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a low budget flick, but it's still relatively decent. Don't expect much from actors, they are mostly not that good, but it can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and doing, some bizarre situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has some charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
