Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in "Wild Reeds" and he is one of France's largest indie stars. In this film he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets vacationers Mathieu (beginner Jamie Elkaim, in a fantastic, nuanced, ethereal performance) on the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with her sick mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon the two will fall in love. <br /> <br /> The broken story of the movie - consisting of long flashbacks, bits and pieces of the present and real-time moving forward into the future - is a bit scary. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal which time period we are in, and the story can be difficult to follow. But keep it out: The last 45 minutes of the movie are so exciting that you can't see your eyes off the screen. Eventually, heartbreaking and uplifting, this film stands with "Beautiful Thing", which will see the cinema.
