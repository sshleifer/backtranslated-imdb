This movie reinvents the word "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, the fat of the group, shows his talents like these generations Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "King of the $ 1 bet", shows that he is no longer in Kansas by consistently raising his bet. Kyle's laugh is really contagious and also offers a little eye-candy to the ladies (like Matt). The dwarfs, while having their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance it deserves. And last we have our protagonist, Ed. He hopes that we will all stumble, stumble, hang, pale folk music still searching for that particular person. And that hope is a little place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a must rental that we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentaries.
