I want to be honest with yall, I was a junior in high school when this sitcom was first sent on ABC, I didn't think I liked it at all. But with John Ritter in it, I felt that it had a little potential in it, plus their was something else with what I liked. The action was great, not many horrible 2. rated comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch and I will tell you why it was a good show. My father, who never sees sitcoms at all, just looks at movies, sports and law and order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and myself and looked at the show, I believe, because John Ritter was in it. I honestly think this show would still run if John Ritter God rested his soul, I wish he hadn't gone away.
