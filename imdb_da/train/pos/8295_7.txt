Robert Urich was a fine actor and he makes this television movie credible. I remember watching this movie when I was 15, and when I see it another time, my opinion stays the same. People lose who they were when they came into this exclusive club, in a computer-rich California town. Urich is trying to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I love the Halloween space package idea, brilliant. This movie is about the fight for one's booze. TV quality that exceeds the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
