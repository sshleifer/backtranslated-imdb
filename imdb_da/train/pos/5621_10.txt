Dark, small, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge out of it. In front and behind the camera he creates one of the most unpleasant masterpieces I had the pleasure of seeing and seeing and seeing again. It never lets me down. People, even people who know me well, thought / think there was / is something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or I should say, devotion to "Le Locataire". They may be right, I don't know, but there is something irresistibly enchanting in Polanski's darkness, and I haven't even mentioned humor. The mystery of the apartment and the former tenant, the mystery that takes over him and of course us, me. This building is populated by great old Oscar winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is mandatory viewing. One, two, three, many, many views.
