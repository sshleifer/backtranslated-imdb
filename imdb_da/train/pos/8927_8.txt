Clair Denis reiterates his theme of alienated fathers, men who follow their own bliss in a particular way, regardless of the emotional charge of their family, but while Nénette and Boni of the former movie live in a narrow world of Marseille, examine we Louis Trebor in the consumer takes us from a remote location along the French-Swiss border to halfway around the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again, the movie in the middle of the stream, with Louis, in his sixties, begins to cope with a dizzying heart while trying to maintain a high fitness level. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, as his cabin is the place of smuggling and gunfire a regular event. Louis sleeps with a big knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move the action together, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a the tip of a mustache) which rejects him as a "lunatic": shown as a dedicated father to two. There are many short scenes that, while seemingly unrelated, build an impression of Louis and his environment. Ms. Godard's camera work is exciting here. The controlling metaphor is Louise's heart transplant, which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to search for another son who does not exist and where Louise's new heart rejects him, just as Sidney rejected the old one. We are used to short scenes in Denis film that are inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni feeds on a spoon; a drive by shooting at Boni's father and then the shortest of pictures of Boni with a shot in the wound in the head; a scene of louis in a morning with a carcass with a transplant, but the body of sidney. The implication of the last two is a rejection, real or imagined by a father, killing something that is indeterminate in a son.
