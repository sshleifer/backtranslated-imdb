Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, have to deal with their two teenage daughters and strange son ... But after John Ritter's early transition, the show was more about coping with the loss of a loved one ... <br /> I found this show, passing through the canals one afternoon, and I have to say that I laughed myself until my ribs were wounded, simply in a row of characters; the witty lines and the situation Paul wanted to do the most with his daughters ... From then on, I caught the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good. But then I read about John Ritter's death ... Shortly after, I followed 'Goodbye' part 2, and I have to say that I was almost in tears, looked at the feelings of the characters, lost a loved one ... How Rory strikes a wall in anger and frustration. ..How Cate deals with having to sleep in his bed all alone .... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show moves on and brings it to Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who make big laughs, when Cate's father tries to protect his family and give 'man-questions talk' to Rory ... But the real gem is CJ ... who is absolutely fun as the wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
