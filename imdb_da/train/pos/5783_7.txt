I've read reviews of Kerching on IMDb, and honestly, I haven't seen a positive review so far. I like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, to make £ 1,000,000 for her mother, he creates a site called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things if only Taj and his 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj from being postponed. I find this show quite fun and I enjoy watching it. The act is O.K., but it can certainly be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him fun. and Taj's second friend Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the café is called "The Chill." We never see him, we only hear him. Taj's younger brother Omar and his older sister Missy are also fun. And Missy's best friend Kareesha. So many times, Taj's have almost been exposed, almost. Besides the comedy, the drama in Kerching makes love for life and the loss of loved ones this program good.
