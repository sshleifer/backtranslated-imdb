This surprised me because I had often been disappointed with Adrian Pasdar, but he got the perfect balance in this performance and avoided both the farce and the pathos while delivering humor and real feelings. The always wonderful Julie Waters is great here, and anyone who has not yet staged her in 1983's Educating Rita must rent it immediately (wonderful movie). The rest of the supporting characters are also well-played, many wonderfully eccentric without going over the top. This one is fun.
