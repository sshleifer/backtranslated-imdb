Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. It is striking that the film is very good at the original spirit, even though the plot has changed enormously. The film language, the rhythm, the special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together. The result is pure beauty.
