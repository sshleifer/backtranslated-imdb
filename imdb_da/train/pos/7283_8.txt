I love buying the cheap, miserable DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I happened to buy this one. It's the perfect silly science fiction movie from the 50s, all sexy up. Rashing with unscientific ALT, easy-dressed girls and lots of melodrama, it's an enjoyable movie for those who appreciate this kind of thing. And if you can 'suspend your unbelief' enough, you can actually be pampered - not just by the psychotic head or by beating the case, but ultimately with the character of 'the perfect body'. It is so . . . . What is another word to remember?
