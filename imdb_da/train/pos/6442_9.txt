It's a fantastic Swedish movie .. it was the first Swedish movie I've seen .. it's simple and deep .. what a good combination! Michael Nyqvist did a fantastic performance as a famous conductor seeking peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as his inspiring boyfriend to help him continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The battle between conductor and hypocrite who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him And defends Michael's noble cause to help his hometown people find their own peace of music. The only thing I didn't like was the end .. it wasn't so good, but it has some profound significance.
