This should be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meeting-girls movies ever made. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" deliver fine images, these movies remove useless subplots and Hollywood deviations. This film focuses solely on seeing the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the movie will lead to the romantic interconnection of these two people. You almost feel the synergy and the chain between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to see them find it. This movie is virtually all dialogue-based. But every conversation between these is also very exciting. What makes this mating so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while you often do not have anything real bearing on something critical, you can sense the nuances, as these two become more happy and proud of each other. These are exactly the ways you would dream of meeting that special person. And what makes it so true is that it is not even fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been safe enough to find a conversation with the person you noticed somewhere randomly. And what puts the glass on this movie is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna, where this movie takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I don't think I will ever tire of it.
