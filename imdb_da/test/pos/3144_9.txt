I watched this movie on the same night, I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds in front of the others with regard to the quality of acting, controlling, filming and originating the story. It comes with a professionalism that is often lacking in short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing performances. The two actresses are both convincing and credible right away. Their chemistry is palpable; The depth of their relationship is transmitted even though the film is 10 minutes long. The actor and the steering are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautiful shot. The lighting, framing and general movie recording are striking. The 35mm film puts this film apart from other shorts. And what a difference it makes. The film is worthy of this film store. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong History. Short films often try to do too little or too much over time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. It is a good balance to tell you an interesting story without drawing it too long or leaving you dissatisfied. You wonder what will happen next time, while at the same time you feel something is happening. <br /> <br /> Nice score too. Compliments without overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.
