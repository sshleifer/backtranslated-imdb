I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and dissatisfied with his wife who fails his death fabulously! All in all, I thought the movie was amazing, definitely not a boring plot line! It is boring to say, but I think many men can feel that way. I think he should have just got a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to, but he felt that there was no other way out so he failed his death. I thought it was nice that Cole's real wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. I think what the guy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was fantastic anyway! Definitely recommend it!
