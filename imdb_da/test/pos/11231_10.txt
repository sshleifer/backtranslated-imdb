A dreamy, breathtaking atmospheric film takes place in a small town of Northfork, Montana in 1955. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city to be flooded with a new hydroelectric dam. There are the other visitors to the city, the angels of another time, but they are only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin calls on the angels to leave the place with them ... There is some immense quality in the film, a dignified grief and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - people and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the final loneliness. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the movie that hit me in the same way and made as deep as "Northfork", the film looked beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after several weeks since I saw it, tears come to my eyes when I only think about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and I asked, "Tell me what I'm doing?" And my friend replied with the words: "You just saw one of the greatest movies in modern times. One of those days others will see the light."
