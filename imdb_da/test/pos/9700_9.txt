We all see the countless previews and trailers. If you have enjoyed Knoxville by the turn of Bullen, you will take great fun in the opening act. I have to take care of the masses, but I was considering taking my (under 18) son with me, but I'm relieved, I didn't. This collection of unpleasant sketches contains a few that are as fun as they can seem to the adult community, some are not for the immature. These guys have to pay a huge ransom to tolerate some of the incredible stunts, sometimes played at their expense. In particular, Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are weak of the group in a few stunts. Enjoy
