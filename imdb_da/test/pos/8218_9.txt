If you actually read this review, I give you a lot of credit. You don't care enough to actually look up this movie that most people have forgotten and then cared to read beyond the first review! So for your reading pleasure ... I guess you know the plot line already, so I won't waste time writing it out. I would mention that Sandra Bullock did a great job with this movie. She really brought much sympathy to the role of a computer programmer that is often difficult to do. I can say this because I happen to be a computer programmer. In any case, I thought the basic plot was a very good one. You can easily build subplots on its mainframe and make it a very entertaining movie. The premise is also frighteningly realistic because it can all happen if the right auctions are not taken. <br /> <br /> To make a long review card ... oops! Too late! If you enjoy Sandra Bullock, who brings a role to life and wants to see a very well made movie for the time being, take a look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
