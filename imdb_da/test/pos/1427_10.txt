Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembers an innocence, now less in the world. I can't understand why the network like American Movie Classics and the like doesn't show this movie even though I've asked for it over and over. <br /> <br /> This movie should be shown to children now for its depiction of loyalty, respect, dedication and determination to achieve the best possible individual. There is so much low self-esteem that is spoken in current daily life, but this film, among many many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the current younger generation to see what can be achieved by reason and decency and pride in yourself and your performance to improve yourself. Sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences. It certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation yesterday. OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND EARLY.
