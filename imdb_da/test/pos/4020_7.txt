Hi everything you jive hustlers, you stone reef, you mean dudes. Beware that slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad movie where you can see a little at night, it's just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n 'relax after its adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why I do not know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Anyone who. The movie starts with the old "murder of a plane" routine. We all know that it is the most effective way to take out a guy in a picnic, full of people. Needless to say, Slaughter survives the trial, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes, I mean, is not so lucky. SMACK !! Slaughterer's best friend Pratt is also killed. This is the start of a great adventure filled with the hippest, funniest music that James Brown has to offer himself. That's right, 'The Godfather of Soul' has put his mark on this bad boy. In addition to Jim Brown in the body, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. What about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts we see none other than Judith M. Brown and last but definitely at least the amazing Don Stroud as the evil hands.
