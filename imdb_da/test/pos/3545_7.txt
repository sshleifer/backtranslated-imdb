I saw this movie in the early 1990s when it had been out on VHS for a while. At that time, I found it interesting, and was particularly affected by the Ken Russell segment with the accident victim in triage and surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night, on a second round of the latest Indiana Jones movie, the vision of John Hurt made an unexpected flashback to "Aria" that I hadn't thought of this year and the sudden memory of The Russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears too little. <br /> <br /> If I can do this observation, I note with interest the love hate reaction that people have expressed to the Russell segment, and I have found this interesting difference in other films that dive into deep trauma and its aftermath . Some get it, others are not interesting. <br /> <br /> I see from the comments and assessment that overall work hit people in different ways. This affects me and affects me.
