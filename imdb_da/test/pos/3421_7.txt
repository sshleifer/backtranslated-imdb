POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> No one is likely to download a DVD from Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's true and reconciliation commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile, returning to her hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African Parliament tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), seeking to escape the prison by witnessing the truth and the reconciliation commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Mrs Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakable American accent. Nevertheless, she is the only known actor in the film, and it would probably not have been made without her or anyone as well known. She does an acceptable job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in German mode with an umlat over "u") are excellent as Jamie Barlett as chief of police, who is responsible for killing Mpondo's mate and captive. Torture scenes appear in short flashes, but they are vibrant and credible. What is not credible is the truth and the reconciliation process - except that it has actually happened. The "Red Dust" should only be seen for that reason, because it was and is incredible that the ANC prisoners could actually forgive the tortures and it is as close as we are likely to see the process going.
