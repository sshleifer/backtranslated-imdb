GRANNY IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. the plot was like nothing ever seen or done before these people are really blessed with a talent, no joke i love this movie. I have to buy it, but I can't find anywhere. it is a dream for me to go and meet the actors and try to make a granny 2.i rented GRANNY on Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than i should have and asked them if i could buy it from them they said no big disappointment and an even bigger one week after I returned it, I wanted to go and rent it again, but came to find out that Broadway video was out of service. if anyone has the movie or knows where to buy it at the time, please tell me, write to me at iloverot@aol.com
