This movie has 4 parts and each is about 170 minutes long. It's based on true story of the life of Joe Bonanno, and it tells everyone how he looked. So in some cases we may notice that we heard different about it. Film makes you tied up to the chair until the end, I think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row, and not notice I saw 2 in row and 2 next day in a row. Acting in movies is OK in some scenes awesome, but in general it can be scary but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor. This shows real things, and the story is the key to this movie. So the one who looks for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic movie, you can skip this one. Good in film is what follows the main story, so you don't want long and boring love scenes or any other interruption with something that is not important to the criminal cases of Bonanno.
