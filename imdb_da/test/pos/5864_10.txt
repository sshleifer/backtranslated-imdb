I remember this movie as the other person who commented said. I recorded it, but I wish I had it now, just because it was one of the worst movies ever. Fun, in a really bad way. I remember the tag line on the box was "The ultimate frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / cheesiest movie she had ever seen, so my mother said, "My son will probably love it." And the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession. I later taped over what I regret. I also remember that the "corck screw" case was one of those bumper things ... the yellow cone-shaped stuff with a red "button" at the end and when you hit the red thing, it sends a ball flight. Well, they used it with a crank at one end, and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer killed, they would show him to come up with the "weapon" and then cut to a close-up of what seemed to be raw chicken and false blood on the victim's head. I don't know what's more to say about this "gem" except that if you like bad movies, it won't get any worse than this.
