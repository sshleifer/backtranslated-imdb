I was also lucky enough to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falk at The Phoenix Film Festival. This is an extremely sweet character-driven movie that leaves the audience enthralled in Applebaum's life situation. More than fun, every character in the family contributes to invaluable comic relief, which not only tracks laughter, but also inspires some happy tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a 90ish "young" father of three, bringing his adult children together in what might be one of the most important times in his and their lives. The 2-day journey that the Applebaum family takes even though New York's lovely backdrop (with carefully selected characters) does not leave the audience more than more, but nurtures their own sense of family. "Checking Out" is a must see movie, not just for everyone who cherishes the family, but also for all of them not !!! My thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to his audience.
