After being marine, I can tell you that D.I. is just as accurate a date to show Marine Corps boot camp and how boys become men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a hard but fair exercise instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film is centered on a recruiter who doesn't seem to "come with the program." A newer movie, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth watching.
