Why do people have to follow the masses and critics' opinion? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack (which also has a small role in the movie) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is pretty good and entertaining. Surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or reads the book, which is not better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans, even included, knew it would be a variation of her to play the love interest again for her oldest uncle. Even as such, the film is satisfactory. What's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This movie is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the masses would have the potential seer faith.
