As a previous reviewer said, travolta stole all the scenes he was in. Genken the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all grown up and still a little dull, but still sympathetic, oh yes! <br /> <br /> Disappointing was William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written or they just didn't care. I continued to see one of the Baldwinsne (can never remember which) in the Hurt role, so Hurts incredible talents were not wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a sweet but not very credible; partly the writing. Character development was just not a big thing in this movie. Just look at Travolta, sit back and enjoy.
