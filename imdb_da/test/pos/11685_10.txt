The rise of punk music was hardly documented on film, and most people tend to focus on happenings from other cities like London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to maintain a snapshot of Los Angeles circa '79 -'81, demonstrating that a vibrant and diverse art / music community had created rivals of everybody else. For some, the tapes read as one, who is the now legendary American punk; Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Germs, Fear. Purists claim that vital bands were missed (Weirdos, Zeros, Bottle Theaters), and that the film was the cause of an attack by suburban baggage and macho violence. However, the issues affected by the movie remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unsurpassed, and the influence continues to be seen and heard in today's clients / fashion.
