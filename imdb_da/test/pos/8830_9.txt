I had first heard of this show in 2005, first online and then by watching (and of course buying) the typically beautiful, BBC binding book. Then I got the DVD; it did not disappoint! I had hoped for years someone would make a science fiction program with an emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser gun battles and other Hollywood 'boogieman' gimmicks! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your Dr. Who works and Ultraviolet - mini series, not the same name crap)! What forced me to write this now (2 years later) was that I had just seen SUNSHINE last night. And what seemed to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY came to (about 2/3 of the way in) Freddy Krueger meets 2010! It was when SPACE ODYSSEY really stood out as a positive example of how to make a REAL science fiction movie; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also treated astronaut deficiency (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's cover on Venus, spats with mission control) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers (the deadly radiation spike on Mars). I would have easily paid to see this in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And to top it all, not only the room's jaw was falling beautifully, but the signs were also well-drawn. I found their interaction more realistic than the brick-breaking histrionics of SUNSHINE's Icarus 2 crew (Icarus; stupid name for a sun task - has anyone read the mycarology of Icarus ??). Sometimes it takes a not so good movie to force one to watch a better movie again. As an armchair astronaut, I would trade my passage on Icarus to a place on Pegasus some day. In all fairness, however, the visuals of SUNSHINE are quite amazing, and quite memorable. Therefore, I was so rooting for it to succeed as an honest-to-goodness sci-fi movie. So, although this review is almost a backdoor review of SUNSHINE, I hope it is read for what it was supposed to be; Strong support for a BBC phone that succeeds where most major budget, inflated movie goggles fail. SPACE ODYSSEY (eg VOYAGE TO THE PLANETS here in the states) gives the appetite to solid, SCIENCE fiction and delivers a banquet. I also very much enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach. Regarding the time delay / light speed, they are corrected if you are aware. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps it cold. If you are considering filming for another dose of sunshine, go for a real SPACE ODYSSEY instead!
