This movie is cute - not cloying, just warm-spirited and friendly. I found it only mildly fun, and the assumption * is * unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver) that they had my full attention right from the start and soon also had my affection. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt has done a good job in her instructor debut, and a good job of writing too. I highly recommend this movie and will see it again, I'm sure.
