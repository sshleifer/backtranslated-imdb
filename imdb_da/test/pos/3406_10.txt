This was the only movie to see about the Civi war. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine and precise. The costumes were tastefully done, sequence was okay and even accents were good. I love expensive Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American history and I love movies about it. I've seen a few and this movie and it's sequal North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you haven't seen it, rent it. As quickly as possible. It's quite an issue.
