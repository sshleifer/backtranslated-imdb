Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out on his trip, which is a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that! David Morse is one of the greatest actors out there and certainly the coolest, and getting him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! <br /> <br /> Because of the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going for a season series - but you never know? The amount of waste that has done it beyond that scares me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series !!!
