This is an outstanding picture with so much to recommend. The plot and writing are amazing, and there are lots of nice phrases in the plot. As a French "Noir" film, its language is certainly much more grounded than its American counterparts, but for me this just added to the realism. In addition, I liked how non-glamorous everyone was - especially husband and lieutenant. About the only negative and the reason why the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a clear plot hole. Like another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the police and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning, but the characters made quite stupid decisions. For this you just have to suspend unbelievers and keep an eye out - the payoff is well worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the finest French movies I've seen. Period.
