There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to watch this wonderful movie again, and I actually got a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as it is out of the public and there are some really bad copies. I got a very good copy of a company called Flashbacks, and that's pretty good. In the old days I saw it on black and white on television and its magic to see it in color. Much better than some would have you believe. The songs are lovely and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are really well developed, which is strange in animated films. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr Beatle is a real cad. It's incredibly imaginative. The way lively things like cotton coils, old cans become part of the environment and have new features are good. The anthropomoric use of insects is great considering the highly painted creatures, most people unfortunately seem to be contradictory. Hopefully we can never step on an insect again! The insects enemy is man. In fact, it is of course the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in Australia, they hold back. The battle has been lost and we must live with them. There are several scenes that stand out as when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a water box, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. It is also quite anthropomorphic, but in a way that is charming. The human figures look very much like those in Gulliver and it is incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It's a crime, this movie has not been hailed as a classic. The only smashing note to me is the apartments in the movie when the characters slip in verse. Talking verse spoils the story and it was not necessary. The verse is terrible and destroys another wise good script. Its great and kids will love it. It is a joy to look at. There is also a very smart ending.
