I had to add my comment to increase this average. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he does really well and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for years, and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will see it here again and again, and humor is adult enough that I don't mind hearing it in the background (and I'm driving to TV for the really fun parts). Simple moral message, lots of decent actions and slapstick, "bad" adults that seem heavy to take the edge off, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat a family standard.
