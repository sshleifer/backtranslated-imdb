This should be one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in movies. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to be, but it hardly means anything. This movie is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and marketing only makes it more because you * know that so often some mom has to reprogram her child to accept our reality after he has checked this out from the video store that expects something completely different. Look at the road map for one thing! And where else in America can you see a 10-year-old child swearing as much as this does, and then getting the eye ripped off by perverting rivals with Pulp Fiction's Zed? And the food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well-known vaguely recognized actors in this movie is one of the best things about it: Soon very soon than you realize, you will also find yourself saying, "Is it meatloaf? Is it Drew Barrymore? the holideck doctor from Star Trek: Voyager? Is that flea? Is it the seed pellets from the Twin Peaks gasses with car exhaust? And is this guy not the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks terrible like Shrek. " my favorite scene is in the end, with Phil in a whole body casting. I mean, why, why aren't there more movies like this shown in planes? This director hardly has anything else for his name higher than Return To Salem's Lot, but he does show real stumbled man-child genius in this creation! If you are an intellectual looking for something to p ** s away your evening on, I strongly suggest this movie to contentment. The movie's plot is far too ridiculous, but imagine it's taken out of context: * Boy's arm that breaks an over aggressive Meat Loaf that seems hell bent on taking its anger out of being accepted to Guns N Roses, watching over the shoulder and watching the doctor from Voyager go into the bar * Can you imagine which half-half-channel channel writer has been active over the last six years thinking of seeing it? Now imagine if you used to eat meat or Voyager at first! Or imagine if you are a flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this movie contains remarkable music, remember you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does that mean for you? This is the delayed, inverted Mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus's sleeve flies back on his arm in an action of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft? When I saw this movie, on the suggestion of my cousin, who had seen half of it in a half-half-childhood at the beginning of the nineties, and which has since been haunted by vague memories of it, I had not slept in three days. It made me laugh! It is, of course, also an anxiety film. The music does not encourage the excitement, but it eventually comes to the point where it is fully established that the American censorship committee has clearly missed this movie altogether and all that can happen will probably at any time Gus turn a corner or the view as much as changing camera angles. I found myself obsessed with the possibility of the cards flying out of the window in a second. Watch this movie. Fantastic!
