What do you mean by the actor's actor, not an actor. You won't be an actor just because your father is a superstar --- it doesn't work that way, at least in the UK. Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can't compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. <br /> <br /> Jason traded through the school, but his big break came in 1985 when he landed Robin Hood's role in Britain's television series "Robin of Sherwood". He has appeared in many films since then, including "Shanghai Noon" and "Lord of the Rings 2". Jason has since moved behind the camera and formed the production company Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped the film on his latest film, which stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. And all this has nothing to do with being Sean Connery's son. If you think Jason told Sean, "Dad, I want to be in Macbeth movie to film," and Sean said, "Definitely son, whatever you say" and made a phone call and made his son play the role, you fail. In fact, Jason Connery is carved by his father's will As he looked like his father is Sean Connery, it's a big part of change. Jason will lose out. The reason behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to supply himself. The relationship has become quite strained, with Jason even threatening to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- Being the son of Sean Connery, <br /> <br /> "I am aware that I must always be compared to my father. There are induendos all the time. Do I have to spend my entire life justifying myself?" ------ ------------------------------ <br /> Stop being a jackass and don't blame him being able to shop just because he's son of Sean Connery (big deal!). <br /> <br /> See Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you will make another opinion about his ability to act.
