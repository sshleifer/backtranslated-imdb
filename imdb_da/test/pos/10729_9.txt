Normally, movies stay out of the realm of "home drama" and for good reason: who will deliberately search for entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them should handle in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families in all classes, and custody is ugly and necessary part of it. It's not escapism - the number one reason why the average person turns to film - it's sad reality. <br /> <br /> Normally, divorce or parental responsibility is simply part of a larger story and affects the way we understand or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why it makes it so worrying. It's a challenge for both this movie and its audience: Turn something so right into something that can catch our attention and then don't make us feel harmless as the mirror is held up to our face. The author / director Robert Benton definitely achieves both an impressive way of adapting this novel by Avery Corman. The story, as one would expect, is pretty simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted will soon learn to be an active father in the boys' lives, and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a parent to him. <br /> <br /> Making an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and special dialogue - heavy first takes a huge trading talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is at his best in this role: his first Oscar winner after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and fast-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the only caregiver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the other important role in her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time, but must communicate both inner pain by her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to Take custody. Streep makes it effortless. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at age was the youngest competitive category candidate in the Academy Awards history, plays the performance of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well. <br /> <br /> Benton's writing and direction takes these notions to the level where we look deeper into the problems of this family than we do our own and thus rethink our thoughts of love and the upbringing of a family. Benton's earlier notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") would not indicate a strong command over the family drama, but the man could write flat. Numerous scenes give us strong images that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they portray. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted is doing Billy French Toast, is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent that goes into this movie in a scene that happens in the Americans kitchen every morning. <br /> <br /> You rarely see a story as easily as "Kramer vs Kramer" made better. There are no surprises at the end or phrases that keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents, and they are all safe fires and provide a new understanding of a topic so well known.
