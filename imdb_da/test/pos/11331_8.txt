The concept of marital fidelity depicted in the film seems obsolete today, but it is precisely the main characters' observance of the concept that makes the whole story so tragically so calming. It is this notion that changes them and allows them to stand out so that those they refer to their respective spouses "are not like them". As Tony Leung said in the movie, love has just happened. There need not be a rational explanation of how it happens, it simply does. Although they did not want to bow to the level of their respective spouses, it happened. Faithfulness, social mores and times that all co-ordinated against this relationship come true. Just being in love is far from enough. I had the misfortune of sitting next to a young couple (still in college from the conversations, they shared me well throughout the film and uninitiated for the pain of lost love and missing opportunities). Their brutal inability to digest the subtle lesson and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize how much a movie like this and other Wong Kar Weis work is wasted on the local audience.
