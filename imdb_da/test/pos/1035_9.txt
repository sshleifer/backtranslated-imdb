I saw this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson turned out to be a great actor. In fact, when he began law and order, I was disappointed with him as it was not so powerful a role. Unfortunately, the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both actual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved, I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And then how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. If you get a chance, look at this movie and see what a performance Mr. Waterston can really give an audience to. Enjoy the movies!
