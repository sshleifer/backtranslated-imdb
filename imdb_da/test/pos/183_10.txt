This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest sights in the history of the cinema. By watching this movie, we can only see afterwards that the 1950s world cinema had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and appropriate use of soundtrack and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not just a form of art. It was much higher than ordinary life, and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can only occur once in 100 years! The audience at that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" in its first release, young couples said quietly about each other: "It's a good movie, right?". I think modern cinema, although technically developed and opened up a new narrative perspective, has lost the public's main dependency. Cienma was once the most popular art from and unlike modern art and contemporary music, millions of people gave hope and ideals. In this perspective, "Letyat zhuravli" must be in the pantheon of classics all the time, such as "Bylys", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
