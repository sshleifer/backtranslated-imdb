Everyone working on this movie did a fantastic job. This is honestly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. Plays, writing, filmography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian movies and gymnastics) I was so delighted with this movie. It gave me so much more than I expected across the board. Hearing the Q&A with the cast and the crew was great, the leading actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it is a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose what is really important. And the author did a hell of a job, as well as managing and editing was amazing. Thanks so much for making a good movie! Thanks also for the line on 'If you want to label yourself, it would be bisexual'. I am so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes are passed on as homosexuals or just, it's great to see bisexuals getting recognition for being existing and being part of the homosexual community and it was nice to label was not even needed at all in this movie. What an end! Just as I thought it couldn't give me more, it did. Beautiful work and my applause for everyone. I want to spread the word, it is definitely a movie that must not be missed!
