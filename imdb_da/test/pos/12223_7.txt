I like the show, but forthcoming authors, get something to do in it! Finish by pulling it on and off. You have a good concept and it can be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is amazing and acts as a child whose age is to act in the situation he finds himself in. Hi, get creativity with the creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or others out-worldly powers. The children's actors in the series are very good and convincing. The parents of Miles seem to be a little too incapable of what is going on, but develop it, come on! You have a big seed here, and there can be a whole new twist for next season with many new characters and creatures and all sorts of nice sci-fi stuff. If they could make a series on a witch then you should be able to make one on these creatures and children.
