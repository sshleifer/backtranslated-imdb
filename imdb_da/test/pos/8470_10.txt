The very first talking image has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! In the fall of 1894, Thomas Edison's associate William Dickson in the Edison lab complex in West Orange, New Jersey, tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to capture sound and image together. In that case, Dickson could not sync the audio and video playback, so this experimental movie was never released to the paying audience ... and thus (unlike many silent films Dickson made for Edison at this time), it has no official title. The silent picture (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known for film historians as a dumb curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" had been recorded on one of the raw wax reels that hit the Edison National Historic Site ... although no one knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now it's changed. Recently, curators have placed the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. These were re-assembled: a playback was achieved and the sound was digitized. Hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor Walter Murch cleans up background noise and tweaked the digitization to make it synchronized with the movie image that Murch had digitally compressed to 30 fps. Sound and picture are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an offscreen man's voice call: 'The rest of your friends are ready? Continue!' (The unseen speaker remains unidentified, but was probably Dickson's assistant Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin in a huge funnel mounted on a stand (one of Edison's sound recording devices) while sitting next to him in full view by the camera, two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballads that dance to the pace of Dickson's music. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts almost 17 seconds: just long enough for us to be amazed at this raw technology before being provoked by laughter at the sight of two men tumbling into each others arms. Mention, here's a WARNING: A well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('The Celluloid Closet', by late Vito Russo) contains a frame magnification from this movie and identifies it as 'The Gay Brothers'. It is wrong. 'The Gay Brothers' is a completely different movie made by Dickson at Edison Lab during the same period. 'The Gay Brothers' has never had a soundtrack: it is a short fiction movie about two brothers who are not 'homosexuals' in the sense that Russo meant it. The late Mr Russo wanted by ourselves to perceive Dickson's experimental soundtrack (probably the first film music!) As an artifact of 19th-century homoerotism. (Hmm, what is it about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there is just no such content here. <br /> <br /> This very important movie deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I have often maintained that no lost movie should ever be considered irreversible unless it was deliberately destroyed: I am very happy to report that this film is finally available to the audience, as the producer intended it, more than a century after it was filmed!
