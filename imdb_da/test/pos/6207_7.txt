Despite recent claims, this early talkie melodrama has little in common with "Citizen Kane": It is a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but jumping around in time. Writer Preston Sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialogue, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of "Kane" are evident. Still, it is very attentive, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-fashioned makeup makes him look like an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little past her prime and not physically well-matched - plays a versatile woman-behind-the-Mon There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous fives in film history, sending the final third to ecstatic soap opera reverberations. The survivor edition is skipped and lacking audio tracks, and there are some plunger holes left open (how would she know if the son was if she sleeps with both of them?), And the music is horrible hokey. For all that I was absolutely fascinated.
