In today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism, it is very rare to see a movie and nothing about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch, while big in excitement (both with big build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare treat, I stumbled across this movie and saw it, scared fuzzy, in the middle of the night. I was afraid of the threatening Russian atmosphere, the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic mute situation and the fact that it (entertaining, always leading to similar) signs could reach the end in a second. Since this is a low budget and a rare movie, we see it without expectations. It also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role, watching and preparing to be thrilled, scared and thrilled in completely unexpected ways.
