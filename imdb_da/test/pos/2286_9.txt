* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to tell anyone who likes entertaining baseball movies, this is definitely in my top three. Only the Little Big League and Major League can compete with this in my mind. I would also like to commend the authors of this movie to create such an enjoyable dialogue !! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very appropriate for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character like a ballplayer. His hostility to playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comic but meaningful interactions with his new team, Dragons. He must adapt to life in Japan ("First you wash, then you bathe!") He finally sees the eye with his trainer and sets his goals to have the final season of greatness even though he is in a lot of other things environment than he ever imagined! So for any baseball fan or someone who wants to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball doesn't let you down!
