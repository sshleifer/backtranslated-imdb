La Antena, an obedient film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a poignant warning story. The setting is a city in need of thoughtless television, its people deprived of the power of speech except a lonely and mysterious screen presence known as The Voice. In an effort to cement their grip on power, the odd villainous duo of tv mogul Mr. TV and crazy scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn his unique talent against their own dastardly ends. It is up to a young family and The Voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a slide of a story that is confusing at times, but never less than exciting. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that carries many of its effects on the sleeve; The obvious references to silent movie caves such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be immediately visible to everyone with a confidential familiarity with their work. But more subtle references and symbolism are behind such tribute. I especially like the fact that Mr. TV and his hands are driving around in typical 1930s gangster cars, pulled from the decade, when the silent film died and a completely different industry began to emerge. <br /> <br /> Let the Antena mines klich√©d plot units and theatrical overlays common to so many silent films, albeit in a very scientific and humorous way. It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the films that it pays tribute to. From the hypnotic television logo to the needy hilltop transmission station, this movie is teeming with dazzling visual ingenuity rivalry for a Studio Ghibli animation ?? and all this with the help of real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> However, the style is intentionally corny and theatrical, but it is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional image. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena gives extra resonance to the struggle between the television empire and the declining power of order. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic whirlpools of the televisions and the nightmare TV food factory. I hate to end this review on a sour note, but I feel that the English-language release of La Antena has been let down by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used for great effect, with much playing around with words on the screen. But the English-language subtitles accompanying the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and errors that sometimes leave the viewer to piece things up for themselves. La Antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that shows great energy and humor while telling a strong warning story.
