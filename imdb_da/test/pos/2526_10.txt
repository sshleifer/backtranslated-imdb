Pixote is aimed at barely a fate of sentimentality. And yet I imagine more that Hector Babenco owes some of his film-making chops with this movie to Vittorio De Sica's neo-realistic style, especially Shoeshine (the movie that with Pixote is mostly done within a children's prison). And yet, while I may still prefer De Sica's movies, if it comes down to deciding between the two, it's so close because it's not supposed to choose between two children. They are both wonderful works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco having an extra edge and harrowing quality to handle, because this is not recorded in conditions brought on after World War II. That's how it was in Brazil - one would see it with a little more flair and awe in the city of God, perhaps in some of the same places - and these kids were on the street before and after the movie was made. Some are not alive about 20+ years later for anyone who knows. <br /> <br /> "Star", pre-teen street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a youth without father or really any family who will look after him and be placed among dozens of other street kids and criminals in a reformer for boys. The conditions could not be much worse and made even more unbearable as two children were killed in succession for some reason for duty. There is a rebellion and an escape, and halfway through the movie we find Pixote with a few other youths, including Lilica a practical transvestite, not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, regardless of getting past. None of this I should repeat is shown with a kind of skinfisted earnestness - surely you would never see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis correct this kind of image for a million years - yet there is an emotional honesty to everything, precisely because nothing is trivialized. Almost all scenes are important to show how fragile life is for Pixote, and how to kill or die somehow in any trip, and then without even reaching puberty, he must be at the level of those around him who are slightly older (but not at all at all) and become things that will increase this person forever. Despite Babenco's use of a tender and sad musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels compelled. As with De Sica, perhaps more and more given the consistent conditions for San Paolo and Rio street kids, he is a natural director of children, and coax is out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others some really good work that gives equal the right hand of "cinematic" drama (it is not so true that it becomes documentary, which is not a bad thing per se) and even subtlety in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be as well known as it is later Brazilian 21st century films looking back on Rio's horrors, or even neo-realistic movies, but it should be. Anyone who wants to get a good, hard understanding of how it was, should find it out in a library or something else and blow in what is the best foreign film from 1981.
