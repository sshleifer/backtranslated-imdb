Highly recommended for all those who appreciate watching movies. Great acting, totally surreal awkward humor, necessary prison sh-t, precise depiction of the male state. Music is also spot-on. I think the artist is "Dip" but not sure. The short loop of the title-credit song on the DVD menu is well-tuned and sounds like Slint. (One thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy with a MINIMUM comment length based on, not CHARACTERS, not WORDS, but rather LINES. Mail quality and quantity measurement based on LINES in the bold era of UNICODE and flexible, web-based style, are like smoking chairs.)!
