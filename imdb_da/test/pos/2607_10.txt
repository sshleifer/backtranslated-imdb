During the War of Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes its forces to defend local women and children against a Yankee invasion. In 1936, Hal Roach decided that it was time for his popular OUR GANG children to leave into occasional lengthy films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two 1935 Civil War films (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in the same direction for his time. Although one got a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success. The small gangsters would stick to short topics in the future. Although he got top billing and the title role, George is ?? Spanky 'McFarland rivaled in the film's first half with a little Billie ?? Buckwheat 'Thomas. Here, two of the finest young actors ever appeared in American films. With all the experiences of old, experienced pros, these two gamin could steal scenes and hearts with the same bravado. A constant joy, without a false note between them, gives them the main reason to see the film today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes provides a quiet, gentleman performance as Spanky's adult patron. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a fine actor who died too quickly during World War II. Genuine Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union in general - his scenes with Spanky are very entertaining. Other Our Times sees the centerpiece of the movie, especially Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; He's going to curl just before the fight, Mother. Even beautiful Rosina Lawrence (GANG school arm) turns out to play Holmes beloved. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly slimy as a fake short-haired turnaround Yankee captain. Bumbling Willie Best and Fake Louise Beavers plays Miss Lawrence's slaves. It should be noted that there is racism in the film, not unusual for Hollywood in that era - but is almost completely lacking in the original series of OUR GANG shorts. Fans of 19th century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack, which is a wide variety of ancient melodies.
