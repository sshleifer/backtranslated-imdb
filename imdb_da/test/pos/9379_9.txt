Edward Dmytryts Crossfire is a distinctive thriller, an unlikely "message" movie that uses the look and feel of the noir cycle. <br /> <br /> Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a soldier company handles their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up in a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, kills their host (Sam Levene) because he happened to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young examines with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the other of the three (George Cooper) who have disappeared. Ryan beats the third mate (Steve Brodie) to secure his silence before Young closes. <br /> <br /> Anchored by a master script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws accurate performances from his three star Bobs. Of course, Ryan does his prototype Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum teaches with his distinctive attentive deviation (however, his role is not central); Young people can never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first widespread rendition of the clever mouth, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack which is rolled into her life, Paul Kelly asserts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable. <br /> <The politically-committed Dmytryk may inevitably bow to prediction, but it is rather limited to Young's reminder of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of bigotas a century earlier (thus, stretching chronology to the border). At least there is no attempt to make an explanation, no matter why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and ...). Intimately, Crossfire survives even the great change that has been made - the novel It is based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a homosexual murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. The Holocaust news, however, had begun to come out of the ashes in Europe, so Hollywood felt embellished to record its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always shook with the prospect of offending any potential buyer). <br /> But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The offense chats up a lonely, drunk young soldier and invites him to come home again, and it looks like (or especially since) there is a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question of whether this scenario was accidentally retained or left as a discrete tip-off to the original engine that generated Ryan's murderous rage.
