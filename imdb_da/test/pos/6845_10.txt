What's with your people? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? Also quirky? Knocking Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman to Have Fun Playing Against Type? And someone liked Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented this without knowing about it and found it as nifty a video find as you can get. Never insulting, thoughtful, funny, scary. I disagree with the naysay, clearly. I thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast, which most likely means the instructor was alert, lifted it to super cool status. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in surround, but I don't jump). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe it has a little woman's slope (the boys in the band are pretty worthwhile). All in all, a 9 and a warm greeting.
