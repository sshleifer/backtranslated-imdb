To persuade, this movie involves two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to connect a gangster. The reason is flimsy at best, as several plot holes occur throughout. But this should not normally matter, as the comedy has to carry a movie like this. There are some really funny bits (mostly supplied by Dylan Moran). But other times there are long melodramatic scenes that don't add anything to the movie. Caines character seemed exaggerated to me. Especially in the beginning, he constantly quotes Shakespeare and acts as a pompous actor. One could say that he played part correctly, but the sign seemed to me flat and unfunny. Overall, I would say only see a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise wait for video or TV.
