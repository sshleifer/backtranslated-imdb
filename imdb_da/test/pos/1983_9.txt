eXistenZ combines director David Cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting David Lynch movie. And it actually works effectively. I will not bother trying to give just the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it will only create more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly vivid that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The movie seems almost to abandon its technology that fears the point at the end, but then throws it in the last twist in the last line of dialogue. There are also some very serious sexual images based on bio-sports in the main characters back, as well as some very brutal acts by Jude Law. He manages to come out as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh looks much better, and everyone else can be called a supportive character, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, unspecified role as a money-understood mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi movie about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.
