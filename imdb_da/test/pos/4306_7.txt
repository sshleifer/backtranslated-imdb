This Columbo is unique because we don't really know the exact result to the end. Our favorite dark horse detective suspects a few lonely twin brothers about killing their rich uncle; each one points his finger to his brother. In a mystery series where the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably only be used once or twice, and that was Columbo's time. Apart from the wrinkle, this episode fits well with others of the series. It has a brighter tone than some, with a very fun performance by Jeanette Nolan as the cunning and loyal housekeeper who immediately dislikes Columbo.
