Having just seen this with my mother (who got it for Christmas) I was thrilled to find something different than the usual things I usually see. All the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong feelings for each character from the beginning. Each story is followed through brilliantly, so you feel completely different things for each character. Cast is amazing, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is deep and wonderful, which makes much foreclosure, I recommend it to almost everyone.
