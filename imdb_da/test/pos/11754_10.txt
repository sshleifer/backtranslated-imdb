Two great stars and a legendary director created a magnificent groundbreaking love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels. <br /> <br /> In his first hit, Henry King instructed Jennifer Jones, Song of Bernadette, and once again leads Jennifer Jones in this movie and Miss Jones is perfect in this role and gives an edgy, beautiful performance that captures the conflict In the character and Bill Holden, who hit home run after home runs in the 1950s with a series of smash hit movies starting with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, born yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic, and of course River Kwai is amazing in this role. Well imagine all but Holden in this movie, I loved the end and weep every time I see it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who don't, you won't.
