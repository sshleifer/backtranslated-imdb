Just looked at it then. It is pretty amazing. The fighting is amazing and the magic is really cool! It's quite like a video game in parts, with a fantastic hand-to-hand fight in there. <br /> <br /> This movie is for the fans: "For those who once loved this world and spent time with their friends, gather again and devote your time ..." In addition to this creepy opening, the story not very hard to follow, and I have never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it is important to be familiar with role playing in general; Knowledge of the genre kind helps you understand some of the better. However, I think if you watch and accept what the movie throws at you, it's pretty easy to understand. There is much that is not explicitly explained, and if you demand it to be then you will probably be confused and annoyed. Watching movies is like being dropped into the middle of some big sagas, and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible. I like this approach you get caught in the mystery and the confusion that all the characters go through. But as I said, just accept. If a strange red lion speaks, turns up and starts kicking ass and names, and the other characters just say he's an old friend, accept it and continue; You don't need a biopic flashback, or a tell-all sit-me-down. You are an observer here, of something beyond your experience and unstable. So: great graphics and animation, good voice playback, cool video format music that involves history and characters and maybe some of the coolest fighters you'll see for a while. It's worth seeing, and while it's for fans, it's completely accessible to people like me who have never played.
