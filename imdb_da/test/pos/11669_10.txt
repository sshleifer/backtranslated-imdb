I am astonished at how a filmmaker infamous for his political left-wingness could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious image. If you are for the death penalty, you will still be for it once you have seen this. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be against it. But what your attitude is, this movie will at least make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There is no false note in the movie.
