I enjoyed the movie a lot, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as concubine. <br /> <br /> Having a Chinese PLUS English subtitle PLUS American accented voice-over was a little distracting, although the voiceover was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> The family name of Qin Shi Huiang Di's (The First Emperor of Qin's) was Zheng, and his name Yiong looked in English he should have been referred to as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng", and NOT as "King Ying Zheng" as these days the two family / first names were not used together. The Qin state is pronounced "Chin" not "shine" - pity the researchers did not get it right. <br /> <br /> I forgot this, but was horrified at the end when the comment announced that he was buried on the "Zai-an" with his terracotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "See-an", never "Zai-an" - surely the American voice-over speakers could have got it right!
