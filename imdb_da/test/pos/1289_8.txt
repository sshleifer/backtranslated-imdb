Christopher Nolan's first management effort, one year before he made "Memento", and it's almost as brilliant as the classic. He uses time differences in the same way as telling his story, and it is a very smart one. Bill is this young writer who begins to follow complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he has. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a theft and he takes Bill together on a couple of jobs to teach him the rope. Both men are voyeurs of some sort and a bond begins to grow between the two. <br /> <br /> But there is an ulterior motivation for Cobb who cares for this relationship, and it all goes very smartly at last. No, I don't want to spoil it, but it's a very cool movie, and I think Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like thrillers with surprising conclusions, this is a must see.
