This is a very moving movie that takes a new twist in a place where we have all been: a relationship that is about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, desperately trying to hold onto her relationship with Bobby for just one day, is extremely convincing and moving and taking you straight into history. Who has not been confronted with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out curtly: "Just one more night!" When he gives her one night more, the journey that these two people share will pause and think about how precious all really close relationships can be and how each - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect rather than just thrown away.
