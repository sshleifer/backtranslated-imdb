This movie was so warmly warmed. A true testament to an actor's real life everyday ups and downs. It was truly a wonderful experience to share the actors' passion on film and respect for what it should have taken off screen. This movie is a reminder for everyone to go to there dreams! Never give up! Hurray for The Stand -in !!!
