I got some free tickets through the Times to see this little-known Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing' ... I didn't know anything about it, so had no presets before I went inside. <br /> The film is about two guys who are limited to their wheelchairs and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Parese and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse spelling mistakes!). They are a bond, as Rory seems to be the only one who can understand what Michael says. They eventually leave the home to live in an apartment in Carrigmore alone. They immediately use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to take care of them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. It's the story in a nutshell, but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way ... actually ... being unprepared as I was .. I found tears flowing too often! Actually! I don't think I've been crying so much to watch a movie since The Elephant Man !!! This movie is a great drain on the emotions ... both in the funny things and the sad things. The action is definitely the place! James McAvoy is my tip for greatness ... he is a great Irish actor and I think he has a good future ahead of him. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also fantastic ... and it was not until today that I found out he didn't suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some amazing actors! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie and plays a part of Home's Manager very well. The other big part must be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and I expect we will see more of her on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> What makes this movie work is not just synergies between the two leads, but the script ... which is just so #### wit it literally is on fire! I still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head myself now. <br /> <br /> The photograph is good, although it is very gloomy, but then it captures a particular type of area in Ireland. The music is also good in this movie, as well as the choice in Songs ... the use of the Johnny Cash cover on the Nine Inch Nails track "Hurt" is inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I were to sum up this movie in a word ... it would be 'emotional'. This movie is very much fun ... and so on the run of a coin it is very sad! I still can't believe it two more days after watching the movie and looking back at what I both laugh and almost cry! This movie is amazing ... and I hope it goes a long way! Although I can't see it, since its advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> Go see it! I encourage you ... you will not regret it ...
