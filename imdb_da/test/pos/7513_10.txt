Patty Chayevsky was years before most successful manuscripts and drama writers in tackling sticky topics. In this film from 1971, he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL, respectively) to look critically at the world of medicine, although his goal is at a particular stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is quite direct: is the hospital's places for people to go for good, or are they money to make organizations where people often die because of incompetence. As a person who has recently been to a hospital too many times (and will soon return) I find HOSPITAL a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the leaders of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a large teaching hospital. He's just started his day when he is told that one of the other year's residents has died during the night in an apparent blend. It seems that he was anesthetized and dewy while she was sleeping on a bed (he had been in a rush with a nurse), and someone manipulated with an i.v. it should have contained water with glucose in it (later it turns out he was given an insulin overdose in i.v.). Soon, Scott finds that when he turns around, another member of staff dies of a heart attack or a broken operation. The key to all this seems to be a patient who came to the hospital ten days prior to a regular check-up, and has since lost a kidney, almost lost his other kidney, and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes) . <br /> <br /> Hughes daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring the comatose father back to his home on an Apache Indian Reservation in Mexico. Scott is not entirely against the idea - after all, hospital errors have almost killed Hughes. In addition, Scott suffers a mid-life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and his family and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession really does. It doesn't just look at a case like Hughes'. The hospital is in a constant state of chaos where the permanent staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) are overtime and taken over and are at war with the business staff (typed by Frances Steenhagen in a really cool performance). The community is hostile because of the hospital's expansion plans - but when they meet to "discuss" cases with Elliot, they appear to be so divisive (militant black pledges against local performance against birth control seeking women and abortion clinics types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott during the film) is increasingly confident that he leaves the city crazy, and Scott also plays with the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was at his height in this movie, what about ANATOMI OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE and PATTON under his belt before the HOSPITAL was made. His anxiety recorded when he and Rigg got to know each other (she prevents him from killing himself because of his despair). He can't tell if anything done in the hospital is worthwhile and screams out the window words in the "summary line". Although he later relaxes how well his teaching has been for doctors studying with him, Scott is really never quite sure of everything - however, he fully accepts his own sense of responsibility as others just dump. Also, Rigg was at the height of his international fame (if not her acting) - her stint as Mrs Peel at THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but she was also recognized as a leading stage talent in the UK at the time as one of The most gendered women performing this period. <br /> <br /> Support actors are also good. Besides cooling Steenhagen (demanding Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from comatose patients in E.R.), there are Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as the bold head of the hospital. There is also my favorite caricature: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for himself on the stock exchange's large board, as he has incorporated himself for tax incentives. Anyone reminiscent of his ideas as ethical types such as. The head of the law firm L.A.LAW or as a friend and doctor to Melvin Douglas being there by seeing his greedy Dr. Elwell sees another facet of this underrated actor's talents.
