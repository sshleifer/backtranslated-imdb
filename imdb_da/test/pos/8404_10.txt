gone with the wind and scarlett are two different movies they were never meant to be compared, of course, the original gwtw actors have all gone away and deserved their own distinct prize and praise, i loved gwtw and never really expected a sequel to be made or ever live up to half the price of gwtw but for my shock scarlett was just as well written and acted as gwtw scarlett itself deserves just as much price i can honestly say i don't know what i like better i think script for Scarlett, a-number 1 was perfect 'as a successor. Bravo! author director producer and all actors Bravo! AS followers rarely live up to their name, the blame is the same as its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you miss that point and a great end to phenomenal beginnings
