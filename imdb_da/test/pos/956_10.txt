If you've seen the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you'll find this to be very similar in history, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andre pradesh. While this is a remake of "Okkadu", you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique movie, Vijay and Trisha make a good pair. Some negatives were when Vijay's character dragged Trisha's character to buy a gift for him, he never apologizes, and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and songs make this a great movie, I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
