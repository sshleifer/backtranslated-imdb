lovely. I just love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a great actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters was perfect too. I think Rupert is the only boy with red hair I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and it was good to see Rupert in another thing, but Harry Potter. And it's a very good actor so it deserves it and more. he only has one golden block but he probably deserves an Oscar Academy Award. There are some actors who do not work very well but still have an Oscar. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
