E. Elias Merhige's existentialist experiment in the end is definitely a hell of a boring watch. It is like something Alexander de Large was forced to see in "A Clockwork Orange." But despite how invisible this movie really is, it's a success. <br /> <br /> If you read this and haven't already seen the movie, it's too late. For me, at least the payout (after 3 separate prospects with plenty of pause in between you) to see the list of characters * after * was told the story. That was when the simple message hit home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a 5-minute story of about 30, instead of 78. <br /> <br /> But seeing how the casting of credits appears prominently on the front of This movie, so the cat is already out of the bag, and you will surely only appreciate this movie if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. Even then you can puke. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend Merhige to design a work of art even if it cannot be packed)
