First of all, despite the low rating on this site, I saw something quite worthy of this movie and would like to defend it. And no, I'm not connected to the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I accidentally came across the DVD of The Wind and had that strong feeling that it didn't would be completely like the described video packaging. So I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I assume that DVD marketing and summary were MTI Home Video's work to hang a rental or sale (the tagline "Love comes in many forms" was changed to "Terror comes in many forms"). Sure, lesser movie rentals and sales depend heavily on getting a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the movie before (a similar case happened to the movie THE ITEM). That's probably what works against this release, as horror fans read the description of an "old wind" that carries with it the "re-documents of the apocalypse." It is easy to believe that this is what this film is about and will make some college students in the history of crazy savage going on a killing. Thus, at the time this review was submitted, it is probably the reason for the lower rating on IMDb. I can understand that people are disturbed and think they were fooled by this summary, seeing the apocalyptic intro, but then experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive marketing choices since I enjoyed The Wind and thought it was a refreshing change in the pace of major Hollywood offers, just because if the intended audience became aware, more might vote for a higher rating. <br /> <br /> "Wind" in this movie is basically only a metaphor for society, and is the story of four friends making some bad choices and how their lives quickly become desperate self-preserving. Having gone too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of their own, a death arises and each person tries to save his own position. Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and ultimately we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation of good judgment. Civilized for savage, basically. This is very evident at all times by noting that the use of a knife, branches such as clubs, fists and kicks are rampage tools instead of weapons. These signs are in a way to make all the wrong things the right reason just to stay on top of the situation as they have already taken things too far. Although there are many implied violent images, it is interesting to see that cussing and nudity are lacking. <br /> <br /> What works in favor of The Wind is the "unknown" actors. Larger stars were originally designed, but I think it works better when you have lesser-known, accomplished actors. In this way, you can get into the story without thinking of "Oh, it's Tom Cruise", for example, instead of an actual afflicted person dealing with an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (like between Mic and Billy in a field, and Mic confronts Claire in her bedroom) stay well and feel completely natural in Fairview's weird universe ... which has cozy homes, a forest and wide open fields. I was thinking of the quiet landscapes that hide darker secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as inspiration in his comment. <br /> <br /> The wind manages to get messages across without being heavy-handed. Of course, if you look carefully, you will see many symbols and dialogue that other directors would just pound you with. I even understood the infamous "kissing scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of history without being surprised that it happened. I am still amazed at how some people (mainly) complaining about two men kissing in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene were of two gals who kissed instead. Everything is handled nicely here, and further views will make things clearer without making you moan and saying "Oh man, how did I miss it ..." Things gradually sink in and I appreciate it. Or you can also listen to the DVD comment for several things revealed! For those of us who "have" the intent of this movie, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) at a time when most movies are made to make only money and be heard knocking other movies out of their " box office competition "standing when mentioned during Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, it is always the big little discoveries like The Wind that stays in my mind, not processed star-driven blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Get past the marketing knob from MTI Home Video and you can just find this an engaging story indeed. I highly recommend it to friends who are looking for unusual movies like this one.
