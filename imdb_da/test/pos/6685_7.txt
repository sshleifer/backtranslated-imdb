After an appalling incident in New York's Grand Central Station, an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic substances. We can understand why they think about this, considering how the man politely informed them that he has his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really like." And then Prot (which he identifies himself pronounced as rhyming with "goat") sent to the psychiatric institute in Manhattan, where a tired unemployment, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski") is trying to understand this man's so-called delusion. Prot's way is polite and cooperative. In fact, when asked why he thinks he has been institutionalized, he replies that it is because "you think I'm crazy." Within minutes, after fulfilling his insatiable newfound hunger for fruit, the prominent Prot has revealed that he is an outgoing person from the planet K-PAX, which lies 1000 light-years away and surrounds the binary star system Agape and Satori located in Lyra constellation. He also describes how his infinitely advanced species have already mastered faster than light travel through the exploitation of the energy of light, a performance supposedly eons away from humanity. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical of these monstrous claims, though he is fascinated by them and commits to understanding how Prot came to believe in such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his co-patients in the psychiatric ward, and eventually offer everyone around him something to live for and hope for a cure. On July 27, Prot later shows that he will return to K-PAX, and he can only take a person with him. Of what actually happens on that date, no one is sure. <br /> <br /> Originally slated to play Dr. Powell ?? with Will Smith as prot ?? Kevin Spacey entered the lead role as Smith had to retire from the movie. You can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character, the complete material delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your production alone has been worth the trip") that often evokes real laughter. There is undeniable intelligence behind many of the words of Prague, but the logic claims to be errant ... mustn't he? <br /> <br /> The audience is led back and forth between the possibilities ?? For the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an outspoken (this is a sci-fi movie, isn't it?!) Before we are completely convinced that Prot inexplicably shows an impossible knowledge of astronomy in a newly discovered planet system. A final study by Dr. Powell gives us a nicely packed ground-based explanation of Prot's delusions, but it is just as quickly whisked away and we are left scraping our heads again. The film certainly keeps its end open and leaves the audience to consider what they have just seen and discuss it with them around them. Nevertheless, whether you believe Prot is a foreigner or not, two irresistible certainties form in your heart: the universe is actually a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher powers that we humans cannot yet discover.
