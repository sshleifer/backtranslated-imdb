Everyone seems to compare this with The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it, I had agreed - I expected The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But after repeated views, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously. Things to remember are that The Matrix is ​​a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in. The 13th floor is a Passable action movie with a somewhat more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not at all an action movie and is not (as many seem to believe) about "reality" or such a "deep" concept. It is about the human tendency to deliberately replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats his "scripted" line. It is at the time you realize that people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of using one's life in the game. I fully sympathize with the "realistic" philosophy that giving interesting worlds where people simply find the right predefined path to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for a rare existence. Living "in the game" does not live at all, but is a tempting way to spend his time on earth. As Allegra, the real world comments, "nothing happens here." Can just as well penetrate into the imagination of others and pretend to do something interesting. (Although I have to ask if Cronenberg regards it as a self-indictment as he himself discovers worlds to be experienced in 90-minute excerpts.) <br /> <br /> Having left the theater after first seeing this movie, thought it was one of the movies that could only be seen to see how it ended. But I've seen it a few times more (thank you SciFi Channel) I realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you only saw it once, it deserves another view.
