This was a rather unpleasant look at an apparently functional family confronted with their daughter's druggy girlfriend. Father joins and eventually kills druggie girlfriend. Wildfire in guilt, he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done. Thread quickly out of hand before degeneration altogether. The only one you fear steals the viewer all the way through, but is still able to scare when it finally arrives.
