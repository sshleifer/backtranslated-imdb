The three names that matter most to this movie are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the whole cast does a wonderful job. The film, even though the porn industry, does not make it possible to get out of hand with its own sexual condition. On the other hand, there were many scenes that involved drug use and although it was important to understand the lifestyle signs, I think there was something overkill in this section. Paul Thomas Anderson has not done much directly, but he may have been selected for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story." One thing that was excellently portrayed is the family as the atmosphere between the characters while they work, live, and party together. Although it is not a typical family, they certainly seem to fit each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period at a time when disco was rage. There are many disco favorites on it and some other amazing songs too. The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited to the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an adult movie star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously, considering that his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. But Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and quickly leads to a dangerous road where he stands to lose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk, there are subplots to the other characters and their attempts in life. You will find yourself wanting and hoping their situations will improve. All in all, a well-finished film.
