Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre movie, and this film proves it. He becomes a very realistic performance as a small horse trainer and single-barrel, not sugar coating every role. <br /> <br /> He can be of the swing heart and dot, then the iron hand of his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he does not want his youth race horse overtime and hurt in small-time races, but he seems to be willing to risk the horse's life when he enters the big time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of Matthaus's wonderful performances and one I highly recommend.
