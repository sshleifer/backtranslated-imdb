In many ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema in capturing these weird, eerie moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is unthinkable an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies who, of course, are fooling around with a camera. In the end, it comes out somewhere between sheer shine and unwatchability (fortunately much more so than the previous one). Part of me wants to reward it solely for the absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time, I cannot completely ignore the occasionally just "acting" and overtly poor production values. First, editing seems overwhelmingly obnoxious and unnecessarily distracting (or perhaps just wrong "innovative"), but after a while I got used to it, which eventually is the true sign of whether or not a movie succeeds on its own terms. I suppose the answer basically summarizes my all-round feelings for the movie. It is, despite the fact that it is monstrous, it works very well as a whole. And if nothing else, a movie like this really shows how fake and constructed the faux-documentary, shaking-cam style can sometimes be when it is apparently used purely for effect (as in movies like the otherwise admirable Roger dodger). Here, the aesthetics are clearly derived from the necessity of the film situation, and are used not only arbitrarily to make it look "cool".
