There is a great danger when you see a movie that had such a great influence on you the first time that 20 years later it will not keep the same magic as it did before. I must admit that I did not expect to be as good as I remembered, but one was pleasently surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as wonderful as I remember when I was a 12 year old. This film has some kind of shine that not many movies have. It's exciting, it's acting brilliantly and the best of all that makes me feel like a child again, and there aren't many things that can do it. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden's rolls in this movie are 1st class and I had forgotten how good they were so far. I urge all parents to put them down and look at it and see if it has the same influence on them as it did to me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10
