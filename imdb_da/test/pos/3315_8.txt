I saw the first moments on TCM a few years ago, but stopped after approx. 15 minutes. I saw it noted on the schedule at Stanford Theater in Palo Alto and I promised I would do 40 minutes driving. Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that starts every movie with the curtains still closed Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in large pink letters scattered against the New York City skyline, I knew I had the right to wait. <br /> <br /> I patched this movie up. There were so many small moments that added to the movie's look and feel: When Hope Lange enters the publisher for the first time, the titles of the published magazines are etched on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); Joan Crawford's swan apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without crushing her outfit; the way the camera tilted to indicate where crazy Suzy Parker was getting (it was almost sideways at some point); how Hope Lange stuck to the dumped apartment she shared with the others, although of course she made a lot more money than at the start of the movie (it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; it was also Suzy Parker. And what about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a child looking at Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> When I saw this gem on the big screen, I was planning another trek down to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. Incidentally, I bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand, and I was surprised when the worker asked me about two bucks.
