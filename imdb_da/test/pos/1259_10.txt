This is an amazing movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you should have it. Sure, the plot is slowly developing, the special effects are ridiculous, the play is ridiculous and the action is poorly choreographed, but as the wrestler DDP would say; It's not a bad thing .... it's a good thing! Everything about this movie is fun, especially if you get the copied version that has even worse actors. There are countless laughs until you reach the end, longing for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women. Then I give it ten stars. Unless you are one of the 'discriminating' and 'intelligent' people with good taste who only like 'high quality' films of the highest quality, I recommend this completely monkydellic movie!
