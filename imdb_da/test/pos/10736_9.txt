I do not think! I mean yes, if you compare this movie to The Godfather, or maybe a little older movie like Casablanca, or maybe even a slightly newer movie like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera's work or cinematography like these other movies, but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie, or does it? I think this movie is undervalued because many people always compare it to other amazing Oscar-winning films (you should never do that) that make it difficult to understand the beauty and realism of this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this movie has really earned them all. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us again one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so right! I have never seen a movie about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play the specific role, but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the flying color test, in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's amazing). Meryl Streep, although in a supportive role, is amazing and genuine, and you just can't help drawing her talent and the way she does it for her and for real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mother and father were beautiful so I say good work to cute little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie, as a third time, I couldn't stop crying alone. I tried, but I couldn't. Thank God I was alone! This is probably the cleanest movie I've ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away, and All That Jazz. I am ashamed because I have not seen any of them, but from what I have heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae I was only thinking of Sally Field. I think that, given the other nominees, this movie has earned it five Oscar, and that it will continue to touch and make others cry for a long time in the future, as it has for the past 28 years. Good work all actors and actresses in this movie to give us good performances and reminiscent of watching this movie that we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
