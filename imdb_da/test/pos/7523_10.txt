Another Raquel Welch Classic! This picture hit theaters on November 10, 1969 with Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet her girlfriends Michele and Jackie. While she's going there, she runs into her former husband who wants another chance. Nikki goes away from him going to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when Alan shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where she only meets Jackie to find out that Nikki died. Alan then goes after Jackie whom he hits with a car and then tries to drive Michele down. Michele jumps into her car and heads to Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls Lloyd her boss in Las Vegas to let him know she was okay. Lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see Jeri about a job. However, there is a problem! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows that Alan and the bartender have a little talk. Back in Los Angeles Michele does not just get a job dancing with Jeri, but also with Jeri Bouncer Joe. Now some thoughts on this picture! This picture was far better than Raquel's last and this one had non-stop action. Luke Askew did a good job of playing Nikki ex husband. He was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. As for Raquel Welch performance, the only word coming to me is amazing. She was amazing in this movie and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The costume she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she had in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, it doesn't matter what Raquel was wearing because she looks good in everything or nothing. I give this movie 10 tissue stars for two reasons. The first and far is Raquel Welch, who is the leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was wall-to-wall tension from the beginning to the end.
