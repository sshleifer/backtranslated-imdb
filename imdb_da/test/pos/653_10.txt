In the early 80s, I picked up Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I have been waiting, hoping it would be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. It's one of the best humorous sign studies I've ever seen. The old-fashioned episode is invaluable. At this time (4/28/02) only two have reviewed it. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, either rent it or buy it as I did.
