Quai des Orfevres takes too long to walk, with Clouzot so enchanted by his back-stage environment that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story. But when it does, it is Clouzot as its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the world-renowned pianist who married himself and plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with design on his wife only to find out that someone has beaten him to it. Not only that, but his carefully planned but cleverly executed alibi is broken, not least when a thief steals his car on the murder scene? <br /> <br /> The movie really kicks into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet police inspector, a pretty wonderful half of the creator of Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half-world-maigre with better dialogue. In a neat race, his study is constantly performed on top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether it's the noisy typewriters of the police station or a high repetition. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of chaos, and tells little details that make Steve Bocchco's once revolutionary 80's American cop shows, similar to antique museum pieces in comparison. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a pretty convincing femme fatale, the supportive cast supports more than compensate, with beautiful Simone Renant a standout like the lesbian photographer in love with her from distant and constantly wrong for Bliers loved Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, who is also unlucky with women, understands and really sympathizes). With a large black and white photograph of Armand Thirard, this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twisting end and a lovely scene with a taxi driver who reluctantly identifies Renant in a police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey, who played the playful philosophical Dr. Vorzet in Le Corbeau, appears in smaller roles as a cab driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> Criteria DVD is quite amazing - Fantastic picture quality plus a brilliant excerpt from a French TV show with interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
