One of the reasons they call the 80s, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Exhibitions such as Wonder Years, World of War (series), V, Amazing Stories and many more have always left an impression for every "lucky" one of us who will eventually find a way to revive. To the top, here comes monsters! A series entirely unique in itself and a theme dedicated to - monsters. May it be the good, the bad and the bad. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic shows or if you are fascinated by horror movies, then this one is for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /> <br /> Even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grinetiness, it is rude use of gore effects or its history that tells power and simplicity. I guarantee because I am 23 :). Don't miss it! <br /> <br /> While it is a show that is apparently forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
