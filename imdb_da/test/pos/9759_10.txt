Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all are unlikely heroes and survivors. Little but strong Jean whose strength and looseness helps save lives, march hundreds of miles and with quiet self-discipline and convincing powers, Joe Harman ("Oh my word") who took risks for Jean and the other prisoners, only for to suffer the worst pain imaginable, and Noel Strahan, who entrusted Jean regardless of odds. Her good humor and hardness inspires everyone around her and those with the courage to join her are rewarded. The beautiful nature and musical score adds to the adventure. Despite the length, it was never boring for me. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago, and I never saw it or them again. Learned my lesson, buddy, and will buy another copy when available. It's a shame that the miniseries are not on DVD.
