Like others who have commented on the internet ... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. That said, and I am the skeptical I am, I went and waited for the top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all not much .. and the movie was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer again today. After watching the movie yesterday, I have realized that the trailer gives the impression that the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. It is not the case. <br /> <br /> The movie is really more character / story driven than action. The inner battles both Costner and Kutcher have to deal with. Kutcher is revealed more than film than Costner's. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a lesser love story .. no surprise there. But for the most part, the film tells the story of two lives that come together, and after a while help each other to heal old wounds. As a girl, as it sounds, Costner and as much as I try not to like him, Kutcher actually works quite well together and complements each other very well in the movie. As critics have said, you've seen it all before. Top Gun, Officer and a gentleman etc. But which movie has not been made a million times. <br /> <br /> I can only remember an F word spoken .. and can't really remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The movie is 2+ hours, and for some it may be a little long to the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you have to cry, but I can honestly say it was worth the $ 4 I paid. I hope you enjoy the movie.
