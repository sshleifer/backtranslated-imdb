Mullholland Drive shows once again that David Lynch is the champion of cinematic expression. On the screen last night I saw a brilliant addition to the history of the cinema. The performances are amazing, the score regrets and the photography fascinating. David's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and amazing movie experience is unmatched. When I saw Mullholland Drive, I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch in this world, we are really blessed. The cinema is also blessed, because in the films from David Lynch we show that a man's vision can be realized with fantastic results. We are aware that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true biographical artist has a chance in this world and that we are actually blessed.
