A German freshman, Stefan hitch walks to Paris during the summer vacation, where he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the Paris freak scene. He follows her in the famous island of Ibiza, the hippie joint meets Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and holds Estelle under his thumb with dope. The couple are trying to escape Wolf, Stefan gets confused with dope and fraud for Estelle, who is groovy and a free spirit. Great photography and music, plot is quite common during the period, but it is not a kind of movie, cold and dramatic. The morale is quite strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I didn't want to say that it's a movie against drugs, even though it puts on enfasy on drug use.
