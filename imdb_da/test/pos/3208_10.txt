Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming TV shows I've ever seen (the second only for my most favorite TV show all the time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). The fast pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused, but when you come to Gilmore, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments I recently (finally) began to see season 6 and wow! It is one of my favorite seasons so far. I love Luke-Lorelai stuff and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I am not so fond of is the surprisingly poor attitude and ruthless actions that Rory has suddenly "adopted". Unfortunately, I do not find this very realistic and hope that it is not just a way to create something more drama to keep the season strong. All in all good season though, and I can't wait for the next !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly et al. "Tookie Clothespin"
