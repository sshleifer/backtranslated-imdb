Anyone who correctly identifies the initial images that God kills without reading the final credit deserves a free ticket to a resting place in Transylvania. I can imagine it as a favorite movie on "Twin Peaks" dark lodge on film night, if time existed there. I would think that a better title could have been: "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology?" The answer it seems is quite a bit. So, despite the stupid "God killing himself", the uber-pretentiousness (an appropriate sentence taken from an earlier letter), the more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi I am the Beast, handle it!" than Christian cosmology (I cannot believe another viewer had the thickness to see the Jewish-Christian Bible in this). In spite of all this ... this is a bold, important work that most should not see. I am both impressed and spoiled that it was made at all.
