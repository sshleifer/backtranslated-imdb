I watched this movie in school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, this is a fantastic masterpiece of a movie. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with that. A definite plus is how it was filmed. Seen in Morrocco in 1904, the wind and the lion are filled with moving pictures like Great Raisuli on horses especially. The cinematography was faultless, editing was sharp, the costumes were beautiful and the scenery was breathtaking. And I must mention the music of Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. I have used this phrase very recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie composer for nothing. His point here is so exciting and exciting, it shows man's true musical genius, and this gem of a score must be up there with Goldsmith's best scores with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The storyline is exciting and the script is intelligent and sophisticated. The direction is also handled sensitively. The performance was also astonishing, with Sean Connery, always the image of charisma and suavity, magnificent as Great Raisuli, he almost dominates his entire image alone. He is associated with a fairy-tale Candice Bergen, a rogue John Huston and a captivating Brian Keith in one of his more underrated performances. The story is quite accurate, perhaps spotty in some areas, but with acting, music and visuals so good I am past care. 10/10 Bethany Cox
