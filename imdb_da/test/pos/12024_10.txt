Dan Finnerty and Dan Band are so-o-o-o-o-o good, they must be seen to believe. Does anyone out there have a copy of the Bravo concert for sale ?? Please, if there is an upcoming release, let's all know it. I checked the Bravo site, but there is no future date scheduled for a repeat of the most appealing guys ever choreographed, Dan Band. What great energy they exude flirt with a cute American boy setting based on butch sensitivity wrapped in sequins and tears, making both men and women fall in love with them. I hope people can influence the powers of Bravo to bring the show back into our lives as a half-year special.
