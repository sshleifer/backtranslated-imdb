Chaplin is a doughboy in his last movie from 1918, a doughboy who can't seem to be marching down straight. He spends time "over there" in World War Graves. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a temporary grenade for one. They cramp in the barracks in the trenches, and when Chaplin and his buddies are washed out of their bunks by flood are highlights. Chaplin ends up catching several German soldiers with one hand, and he sparks the German commander to refuse a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replied that he surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things, and these scenes are very fun. He escapes to a bombed house where he meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He is traced by German soldiers, escaping from them again, and Purviance is arrested for helping him. Chaplin is able to pull a fast one by raising a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. He ends up saving Purviance of course and catching Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin uses some synagogues and slapsticks by returning the German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the location options in the movie while keeping the audience's attention closer to the length of time, which his contract with Mutual Film Corporation forbids him. The movie also allowed him to poke fun on the enemy, something he would again make for greater effect in the Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
