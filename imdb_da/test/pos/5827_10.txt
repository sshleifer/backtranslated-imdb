What a great show! A very underrated dramatic show. It's good how there are no protagonists, and each episode some other characters are the protagonist (s). I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a hard, bad guy and an Aryan beyond what makes him a real bad guy catching, there are many who are known to be. This show has many murders, I think it's a little over exaggerated for the murder of the show, but I have to admit that this is one of the reasons I think the show is so big. I think some characters were killed a little early, but some probably still made their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break to this show, they are completely different. I think some of the actors on the show are also very good and undervalued and should be what is due to them. A good show, my favorite is. A show that should be considered the greats in the coming years.
