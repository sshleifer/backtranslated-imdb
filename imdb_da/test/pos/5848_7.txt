Not bad, but it could be much better, also seems to follow a staple for crime drama. You have Sandra Bullock as a policeman who finds it hard to work with others you have placed her with a new partner. There is a closed case, but a policeman working on it anyway, and there are so many corne lines in the movie that make you scream. But if you can see past the formal elements, there is a good movie store below. It's gripping and the subplots worked for me. Well worth a rental but maybe not a purchase.
