This is a superbly crafted top-notch Washington thriller directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with hotshot scriptwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so perhaps he tends to have his roses). The movie has Clint Eastwood as an aging secret service agent and John Malkovich as an avenged assassination assassin against each other in a massive test of will and ingenuity where the president's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost condemns the president, which is an authentic touch. This movie was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and that's all so effortless for the old pro. There are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he walks past the president's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if any other noted humor where those sounds have been added. My "guardian angel", whose name is Vigil, enjoys this movie even more than I did, but lifeguard movies are very much his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls to Eastwood as she is so scary but so talented and she shines. The excitement is tight every inch of the story in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggle to redeem himself from a previous failure is evident in his typical discrete action. With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow with a millimeter, beware! Of course he is the master of the supercool. Malkovich has the opportunity to spoil all the trouble he could wish for in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection. What a good one.
