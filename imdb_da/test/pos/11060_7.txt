Maybe this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could break less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially in dark hair. The movie is worth watching for the supportive cast: Flora Robson is great as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface and can have an expression of evil or a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin, who serves dwarf, has a nice role to keep you chuckling despite some overcrowded scenes. Speaking of scenes steals Florence Bates most of them she is in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad battle at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood drunk. It's a strange feeling when you realize that the movie's title refers to a railroad instead of a piece of luggage!
