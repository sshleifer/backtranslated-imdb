Surprisingly well-acted, well-written film about hard rock-but-decent young man gets the very hopeful ticket to the star: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their leading songs. Not removed, the film tries to keep things in perspective and does not go over-the-top; It makes you think twice about the lingering young fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite a solid dialogue, follows a tried and true formal pattern and is knocked down by its own clich√©s in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "Almost Famous". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish may have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 from ****
