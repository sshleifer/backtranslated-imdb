I was impressed with the story. It had the "typical" predator and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But they each had friends and family who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some fine and some not so cozy, each with their own personality shades. And they reminded me most about people in my own life. The story starts with several humorous moments and slowly develops into a heart-warming relationship movie. The story progresses with no obvious plot change and never speaks to you. It makes you think a little while waiting to see what happens. Even when I thought I could foresee something, I was surprised how it actually happened. <br /> <br /> Not many movies make me laugh at a real gay dialogue and then get a tear in my eye when I feel the signs' pain. I watched the movie on DVD and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over. (Usually I see a movie in pieces over a couple of days.) It's nice to see a movie of gay characters that dissolves, but doesn't preach. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for the gay audience. Conditions exceed sexuality.
