I have been waiting for years to comment on this program and it was time for some justice to be done. This is one of Christie's darker, more sinister and engaging works, not just that someone is killed for money, it's a dark and thoroughly engaging story of mystery, intrigue, love and murder made better by the changes that the adapter have done. The action level is absolutely fantastic, Joan Hickson is sublime in the part as always! The rest of the casting, such as Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, perform beautifully, but it is my view that the show is stolen by Margaret Tyzack, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is simply magical, the actor is as good as it gets, chilling, moving and absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Let me know if you agree with my words. I'm seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well Geraldine McEwan's version is. See and enjoy.
