Director David Schmoeller gives this film an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that reaches nightmarish proportions. Also, Schmoelloer occasionally adds touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings. <br /> <br /> Waiting actress Chuck Connors is the best of the movie's decent cast. Pino Donagio's music score is excellent, with both lyrical and solemn themes perfect for the movie. A number of the movie's sequences are quite memorable. <br /> <br /> For horror and thriller fans, the Tourist Trap is an unforgettable must-see movie. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
