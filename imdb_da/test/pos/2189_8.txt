Now I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so even though I have the cast album and I've listened to it a couple of times, I've never seen this show done, nor have I seen the Tim Burton movie version. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see Burton one and give it a try as a movie. This version is not at all a movie, it is a filmed game with some of the original cast members, including most importantly Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of the performances that is like a canal in the heart of the magical Broadway and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd herself is not played by Len Cariou who did it originally, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou's, but he seems to play it a little wider. The only problem I really had with the Johanna character as played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her love Anthony as played by Cris Groenendaal. Josly's voice cannot maintain high notes, but I wasn't quite sure if it was supposed to be, since I'm not very familiar with this game. More importantly, I'm not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really ceases to hold enough to maintain some of the music, but fortunately, it doesn't seem to be taken seriously by its creators. As a lark and a bit of comedy in the way of "Grand Guignol" it is quite fun. I don't think it's just as important a job as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or any of his other shows. Some of the music is quite spectacular, but on other points it seems to exist in a world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say much about this because this is a movie site and this is really not a movie but just a game that has been shot on film. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around, but that was it. People want to see this because it preserves Lansbury's legendary performance, which deserves its legendary status because it's a fun and insightful achievement. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. This would be a great movie to show children over 5 years of age to get them interested in musicals, because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Seeing a performance so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater because I prefer shows from the 20s to 50s to these later era conditions . "Sweeney Todd" is an outstanding show from his era though miles and miles across AL Webber's madness.
