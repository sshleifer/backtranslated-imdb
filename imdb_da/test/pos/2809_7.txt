The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how to get the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that is not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com, but it's not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I searched through Google to get some details, but there was none. I would appreciate it if anyone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and are sung by a country artist. I just need title names along with the singer. I would recommend this movie or rather songs to any country that loves.
