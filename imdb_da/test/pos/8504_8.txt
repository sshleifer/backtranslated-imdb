The famous French detective Henri Cassin takes his first holiday for 11 years in St. Margot, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the holiday-holders. Despite being promised that childhood sweet Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite Nanette's father protesting because of Henri's age. On the day of their wedding, Leon returns and Nanette runs after him. Nothing is heard about the two until both are found dead, and Henri swears he will not rest until he can find the killer. The only trace Henri has to work with is a footprint found by Leon, but he also gets written warnings that others will die soon. Soon Nanette's mother is dead and Henri has no idea about the murderer's identity. Thinking of a mistake he returns to Paris, he understands (and fears) that the killer can only be a person, even though none of his colleagues can believe in his explanation. In addition to the common murder mystery that does not really follow the formula of others of the genre of Columbia or other B studies. In addition, it goes directly to Director Lewis who manages to make this a noirish movie despite the film's setting, also with the help of good camera work and lighting. Geray is in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the throw is able to carry their performance. Rating 8.
