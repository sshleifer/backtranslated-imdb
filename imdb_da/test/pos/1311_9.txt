I originally saw this on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a great movie that left a good impression on me. But I saw it on Irish TV recently, and there was an extra story by Roy Scheider ("we need a bigger boat!"). It ruined the movie for me. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film and if something goes from the movie's brilliance. I wonder about the new DVD version that has no Roy (for legal reasons?) Would stop people from buying it. Well believe me, the movie is much better for it! <br /> <br /> Bowl <br /> <br /> Damian
