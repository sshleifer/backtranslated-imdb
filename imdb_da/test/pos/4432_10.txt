I have never heard of architect Louis Kahn until this documentary. In this almost two-hour documentary that goes very fast, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, where he studied and learned. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California and New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half sister Alexandra Tynge from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a co-architect. Louis's passion was his art.
