"Two Hands" is an entertaining, fun story about Australian lowlifes. The play contrasts the world with fast money and deadly actions with inexplicable fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to consider the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without being fully aware of the root causes. Fate and circumstances take Jimmy, the protagonist, into situations that create the realization of his superficial dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more promising world. <br /> <br /> The clueless Jimmy, portrayed by Heath Ledger's greeting, is a child who grew up without opportunity. The high paying world of crime gives the greatest appeal to his dumb senses. Love and help from friends leads him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The movie is orderly and well run. The band of criminals speaks passionately and contemptuously, and keeps us interested in their crazy antique whole movie.
