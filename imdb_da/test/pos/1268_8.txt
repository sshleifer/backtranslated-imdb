There are two things I've noticed in this movie. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in the story.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&B, he finds the "box". As soon as Cole finds it, he says, "The box. Everyone has a box". A moment later, just before he dumps the contents of the floor, he says, "We're actually very lucky. You can't see these often." Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> I had to see things three times, I couldn't figure out a few things. Then I looked at the chronological version and saw that they had flashbacks from the latter to the previous one in the course of time. So at some points we actually saw at three different times in approx. 1 min. It was a good thing because I didn't know how many times I could see it before I returned it to Netflix. <br /> <br /> Get me obsessive.
