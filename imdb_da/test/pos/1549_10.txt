Back in the 60s, this ugly study by Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to career Ken Loach, who became one of the most prominent and respected British filmmakers of all time. At that time, I knew very little about Brecht's politics or the underprivileged reality, and I was very impressed with the film's aesthetics, its free style, the tight color quatra- matography and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find out that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little screen time. Although the 20th century Fox distributed "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach was not in the mainstream cinema (which this movie is hardly), and I lost touch with his films. I just heard about his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I caught up in the 80s. The beautiful title song of Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
