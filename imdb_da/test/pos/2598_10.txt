If you overlook the fact that the plot has been made many times, it is a fun and fun enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the background is so detailed and a lot of bold colors too. The script is razor-sharp and the sight gags especially the Daffy constantly getting the head blown off is excellently timed. I really loved the arguments between Daffy and Bugs and that Bugs wins every time. I also love that Daffy is really greedy and scary while he is incredibly fun. I prefer him when he's manic, but here too it's fun. Bugs are still his charming and rascally self, and Elmer is fun if it's too stupid. In short, it is absolutely brilliant, and in fact my personal favorite in the pure entertainment value hunting trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox
