Shuai is a burly and eerie young Beijinger with a punkish haircut who publishes a live salesman cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. He wouldn't seem to have anything in common with the wiry, middle-aged, intellectual, Zhang - and yet the two in a restaurant close together to discuss pro's and con's of murder (the Chinese title might be better translated as "Talk It Practice"). If it makes it sound like a pedestrian, don't be misled: this movie is overwhelmingly inventive in its plot and runs mostly at breakneck speed (though the pace flies rather hard towards the end). <br /> <br /> If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his recent martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you will be amazed; In fact, which of his other movies you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is by far the most original, most quirky, most experimental work. It was shot within a few weeks on a minimal budget, almost exclusively on the spot in Beijing (and utilizing many common Beijingers in the less-supporting roles - there is even a fleeting cameo by the director himself) and mostly with a hand held camera in a jerky hyperkinetic style, which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his most famous film. OK, I live in Beijing, so I find extra joy in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that I will recognize and enjoy (though it was shot in '97, and it changes so quickly here), but I really think this movie can be appreciated by everyone. I saw it when I have so many other Chinese comedies, at a movie club that shows subtitled versions of recent Chinese films to an almost exclusively broadcast audience; And that's the only thing I can remember where the audience laughed aloud. Some non-Chinese audiences may find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, as it involves some violence, and after opening like a breezy, eerie romantic comedy, mutating to something much darker in the other half. However, it is very, very fun. It is also superbly traded by the two leaders, especially long-term Zhang Yimou partner Jiang Wen, who is probably mainland China's premier movie star, and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to prove that the Chinese have a sense of humor that can translate into other cultures to prove that Zhang Yimou is far more than a one-trick pony ... ... and for a good time.
