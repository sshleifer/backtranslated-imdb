I recently started to see this show in syndication and find it a little hit and miss. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is sad something trivial / juvenile and seems stupid. <br /> <br /> Still, others are very entertaining and sometimes touching. These include the episodes that stand up for the character's complexity. For example, "the young overweight beloved guy marries sexy wife" theme found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, visually. Not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) But Carrie has an edge - she can be good at her eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different from her father . <br /> <br /> And she admits easily - for example, an episode in her lack of desire to be nice goes together. I personally find her sexy sex, but you have to be the right person to live with it. Amiable Doug is a good game. And deep down, also see the simple things. Maybe, not so much as Doug, whose nirvana watches television and eats a big snack next to his big screen, but no culture gallows her. This lack of a sensitive side is one reason why the two do not have children. <br /> <br /> Of course, a guy's simple pleasures are nothing to snow on and adds to the charm of the show. They live a common working class kind of life in Queens - it's realistic in that sense. And overall, fun and comfortable sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. It gets a little tired at the end, so it's probably good it ends. It had a good run. See also Becker.
