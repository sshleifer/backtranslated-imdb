This is a good well made for tv flick of the 'what if' variety. What about what if terrorists exploded a "dirty bomb" in a big city, in this case London. Lots of poking at people who say 'we are all set in case of an emergency' that then reveals that they are not exactly telling the whole story. And is anyone prepared for something like this? You can't bet on it. This shows the material that the bombs are smuggled into the land, the bombing of the bombs, the secret and the dual lives of the people behind them, etc. It also shows public servants (ie firefighters) who give their all to save people when they no help when the government does not want to send anyone in the affected area. Also shows how much insufficient preparation there is for such an event, as the government speaks everything, but stands there with the mouths open when the tragedy unfolds. And can it happen here right here in the good old United States? Well, unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years, something has already been done to some extent and you shouldn't bet anyone would be prepared for anything like this. This is quite realistic and yes, even scary. Well worth seeing, but just hope nothing like this ever really happens. 8 out of 10
