Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a totally wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is described through flashbacks. Sayid draws a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" if Michael crosses the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch protected by Mr. Echo and do not press the button on the computer to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best in the second season. Unfortunately, lovers of "Lost" can see the lack of respect the producers of this amazing series have with the fans. In the United States, the air date of this episode was May 24, 2006. Therefore, fans have to wait for the third season in a very exciting situation where Jack and his group are surrounded by "The Others" and find the truth about Michael and Ana Lucia and Libby's death John locked in the smell without thinking of the button and Mr Eko in despair outside the door. I hope the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
