If you've been there and done it, you'll absolutely love this movie. I have and know "there," I mean underground clubs and housewives, where finding people who are just full is far less common than finding people high in their ears on accuracy, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> By "it" I mean dancing and sweating like crazy for eight hours or so in a row with out even a brake, followed by a way to long mornings without sleeping and almost I want to die , followed by a week of just waiting for the next weekend to do everything again. So even though this movie is one of my absolute favorites, I can certainly understand why some people or most of them would not like it.
