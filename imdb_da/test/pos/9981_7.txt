This is not a movie that I would typically watch at 2:30 in the morning, but I got into it and couldn't stop until it was over. Shia LaBeouf showed that he is not just a young actor here, but could handle more demanding roles. The fact that he has been given these roles for the past two years is testament to his ability. It was really his movie. Sure there were others involved, but they were pale to his role. <br /> <br /> This was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it to the masses, much the way Tiger Woods has opened golf on all races. As Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) told Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): "... if Mr Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it's because he's the best one because of who he is. Not who his Dad was not how much money he has because of who he is bloody! And I want to thank you for remembering that. " Get charged.
