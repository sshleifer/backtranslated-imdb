I'm just looking at the 100 bottom films according to IMDb users who see if there was anything to browse, I haven't yet, and I found this little screen gem. One of the cases where you see a movie that is one of the worst, and you just have to be one of the few who actually likes it. Darn, well I guess I'll be ridiculed and spit on here, but for me it was a good flick when I saw it. It has been a while, but I remember it used to come on HBO late at night, and I saw it two or three times, and I haven't seen it since, and I'd love to see it again now when I knew that Jolie was in it. The story follows a cyborg and a guy tries to escape this company's links and some bounty hunters after them. I think it's pretty much all there is to it, throw a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good actions here and there, and also blood and violence. There is also a love story at stake as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight to fall in love with each other. The dialogue sometimes gets pretty bad at times, and it is by no means a prime movie, but for a B movie it is really good. I do not know if it was a theatrical release, although it does not seem to be of high quality for it, but it makes it one of the better direct to videos if it was one of them.
