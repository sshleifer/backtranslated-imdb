Brilliant work. Marvelous actors dissolve as brave and brave characters. All unforgettable parts in a more than exciting and captivating action ?? thriller. The casting is perfect. Both from the side of the stars as: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed with the young actor playing the boy's member, Mustafa. You trust each one from the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all white power supporters. I admire the music for the main theme of "Children of Wax" .This soundtrack is a charming mix of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kiers humming ?? And at the same time, Children of Wax "a story focusing on race conflicts. The intolerance and brutality between skinheads and the Turks.
