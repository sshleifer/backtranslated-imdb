Steve Allen said that current humor about serious events can be found by many to be acceptable from the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939, before the German attack on Poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events, including Blitzkrieg (after Sitzkrieg), who took Germany to the channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation in Dunkirk and gave the world the morbid play of a lying france prostrating its honor for the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> Things of romance, comedy and a great doll of serious drama? Yep. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau with a well-tuned and excellent cast creates in "Bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and fantasy that are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers (the sloe -eyed and beautiful Isabelle Adjani) is France's best actress, as the warrior gathers across Europe (which overused the cliche, sorry). A veteran self-serving bedhopper with many affairs for her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "All that is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane." After a premiere of her latest movie, a minister in the incompetent Reynaud administration , Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she only goes home to tired encounters a former lover who does not understand the word "no." She decides decisively the problem, but so stuck And histrionically, another former beau, the still occupying Frederic (Gregory Derangere), is helping to cope with the clutter of her apartment. Frederic is an expectant historian. <br /> <br /> Once again, a cartoon accident , almost as a public service announcement, the importance of working windscreen wipers puts Frederic in jail on the most serious charges, fortunately the Germans force out of their static p ositiones a wholesale of prisoners in southern France, but our boy escapes and makes his way there privately, rather than as the state department. <br /> <br /> The panic and fear in France, which the Germans swept to victory, is well portrayed and a new twist comes into history. Who will meet Frederic, but the really beautiful young research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), who accompanies the obligatory Jewish refugee researcher, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" he needs to come to England. Of course, the Germans do not speak to this important ingredient, because you know what (this part is pure fiction - there was never any heavy water in France in 1940 - just Perrier). And Camille is so huge and dedicated. <br /> <br /> What next? Peter Coyote as an assumed French journalist, Alex Winckler. Tipped off with his name. He is really an officer in Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he also used to bed Viviane (and want a rendition of their affair). Apparently, this kind of Kopolski is the only great male character who does not want to get rid of the actor. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and mishaps integrated seamlessly to produce a very fast paced and enjoyable movie. Partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on "Casablanca", this is a remarkably fun movie (except the heavy Nazi bits). Isabelle Adjani deserves kudos for the best depiction I've seen in years with an adorably sweet total narcissist with few if any redeeming features. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose fear of Viviane exceeds his diligent duty to the Republic. As a man in power at a critical time in French history, Beaufort is forever confused. <br /> <br /> Not shown in too many theaters, "Bon voyage" should be available for purchase or rental soon. See it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
