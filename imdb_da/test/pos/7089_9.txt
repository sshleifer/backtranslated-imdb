"One True Thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired by very strongly inspired performances. I'm not necessarily saying the movie is uplifting because it's not. In fact, the film is downward rather depressing. I try to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from a crowd present. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing" enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful films of 1998. The characters were perfectly cast. The performances are all guaranteed Oscar Nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays dying Kate extremely well. Her action alone was enough to make the film excellent at the point of recommendation and give you a new point of view on her. I also thought that Renée Zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeled woman who should look after their own mother. The other cast members, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also excellent. The writing in this movie was truly amazing. It's fun how the film's concept is related to the controversial events in my local area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now, a big problem here is assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkian's (excuse my misspelling if that's how) ways have just been banned. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November. Having seen "One True Thing", it really changed my perspective on this subject, though I have always believed in it. Without revealing the end of the movie, I just want to say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie, and I think it fits into the beautiful story. Overall, this movie actually has more emotional influence than "Titanic", "Save Private Ryan" or any other tearjerks released in the last few years. I think it's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it's better for an audience. And that can actually happen to you.
