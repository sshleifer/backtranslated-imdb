I gave this chance a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his Urkel character, but mainly for Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD. As I said, I gave it a try and I was very happy about it. I never cared about the Urkel character, so I was happy to see Mr. White in a different role from the ever annoying geek. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but came the second episode, everyone began to call him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J was dating ex-Cowboy's cheerleader with the snob kid. ("Don't you talk that way" in my momma! "" This is adult talk you stay down here! ") The only beef I have is that the show should have 3 main characters, but Mr. White's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always have the back stories ... It's not exactly a good thing when a story about the two who are possibly pregnant takes the back of J. having to babysit his girlfriend dog ... .. <br /> <br /> Other than what I really want this show to have lasted a little longer, unfortunately, it seems that people were not interested in Jaleel White as anything other than the God-Awful Annoying Boob known like Urkel .... Hope they at least put it like a DVD box set.
