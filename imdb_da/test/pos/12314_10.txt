It does not often happen that a real director's last film becomes such a moving, brilliant and filmed masterpiece. The casting is excellent as well as the camera. What begins as a joyful gathering of a group of well-educated citizens in an early 20th century. Dublin becomes a dark, philosophical tale of all our fears from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thanks, Mister Huston, for this last piece of big movie theater!
