The film is a really well made, which is great and looks and passionately aimed. You can tell that every shot is thought of and executed to perfection. For the film's lovers, this is especially a good watch, and they should especially appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for the cinema being put into it. It is difficult to place this film under a label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller, and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it's more of a movie with its own style, it does things its own way. It does not necessarily follow the film's rules and contains many different elements from many different genres combined. <br /> <br /> But just as the movie is the protagonist, the movie becomes a bit slow and dull in parts. The artistic style of the director tries to conceal that the story is actually quite simple and it is more like the movie only relies on its style and the general atmosphere created by the film. It doesn't make the movie horrible or anything, but it just prevents it from being a true absolute necessity. In parts, the film also feels as if trying to be too poetic and trying to let the pictures speak too much for themselves. It just feels a bit exaggerated in parts, but most of the movie still works beautifully. <br /> <br /> It features some amazing cameras and some unique storytelling, making this an original as well as a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
