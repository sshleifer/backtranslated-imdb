Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? The years of hard work averted in what is undoubtedly one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> Like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, the sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet are rare and have not even experienced most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you are the curious type that 'will know'. <br /> <br /> However, Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary. It's getting a bit repetitive after the third episode. How many ways can different sea creatures teem, kill, poo, bud and lay, and really do all these ways need to be explored? But if you have a great interest in marine life, this repetition should not be a problem for you at all.
