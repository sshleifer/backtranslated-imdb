After watching the trailer, it was an easy decision not to watch this movie. I mean, I don't care about stupid "stoner comedies". I'm sure it was also an easy choice for many people to get together, smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from The Simpsons and a guy named "Billy Bob." It should have been a good time, but the movie is just not that fun - too bad that someone has to go and pummel loudly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already gone to the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Beautiful places, quality production and excellent performances from all over the cast. Looking back on it, it wasn't entirely unexpected, but suddenly I didn't find it difficult because the premise was so engaging. So why was this absorbent drama marketed as a comedy? Has anything happened to the manufacturer and the associated producers are leaving the marketing by themselves?
