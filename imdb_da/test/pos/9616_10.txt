As a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Sure there is nothing special about the plot, but man is entertaining it. Like most movies in the genre. This movie is packed with action and does not burn its viewers. It's so much fun when I see I have a smile on my face all the time. This also affects future movies like Kill Bill. (Many of Kill Bill's sound effects come, for example, from this movie.) This is the essential display for all known viewers in Kung Fu. Form open to close this movie is full of battles that are really some of the better I've seen in the genre. There are few Kung Fu movies out there that measure up to the glorious magic and entertainment of this movie. So if you're looking for a Great Kung Fu movie, check this out.
