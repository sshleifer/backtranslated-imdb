Warner Brothers engineered significantly with American history in director Raoul Walsh's leading Western "They died with their boots on", "a great track" director, a somewhat inaccurate but utterly thrilling biography of the cavalry George Armstrong Custer. The film chronicles Custer from the moment he arrives at the West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at Little Big Horn. This is one of Errol Flyn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn often joined together, and "They died with their boots on" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white otter is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and high dramatic confrontations between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious flaws involves Colonel Philip Sheridan, who appears as the commander of West Point before the Civil War. In fact, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this time. In fact, Commander Robert E. Lee was the former Flynn movie "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historic lapse concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union troops throughout the civil war. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in fact Custer did not kill or smoke. Nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs detract from a really nice movie. <br /> <br /> "The dead with their boots on" open with Custer riding into the West Point Military Academy in a fancy dress consistent with an African American carrying his luggage and bitching his dogs. After the guardian sergeant admits that he has shown a vengeance for a future plebe instead of a senior foreign minister, Sergeant Custer turns over to a rogue Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy from "City for Conquest") to take charge of him. Sharp plays a practical work at Custer by installing him in the quarters for Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force"), which immediately runs Custer. Of course, the fleeting Custer is attacking in a public fight. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Katie Elder Sons") is willing to reject Custer from West Point for behavioral concern. As it turns out, Sheridan can't show Custer because Custer hasn't signed up. When he registers, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerites to a large extent. When American civil war erupt, West Point educates cadets that have not completed their education and hasten them into battle. One of the last cadets hustled in war is Custer. Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of the Santa Fe Trail), and he promises to each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart or "Carousel") detesting the sight of Custer. It seems that Bacon ran over Custer in a saloon and offended one of Custer's friends and our whole, reprimanded Bacon. At the same time, back in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has him chilling his heels. Custer befriends Rotund Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that become one of Custer's characteristics. Scott not only ensures that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but Custer also uses Taipe's horse to get to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Custer complies with orders from none other than Sharp, beats his superior officer and holds a bridge so that the infantry can cross it. The wound in the shoulder and sent to the hospital receives a medal instead of a court battle. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army in the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance that South can win. When a brigade general cannot be found, Scott Goads takes Taipe to promote the first available employee. An error is made and Custer is promoted. Creepy at first embraces Custer's moment and cracks Stuart's progress. After the war, Custer goes down and begins renovating with the boys at the local salons. Sharp turns out to be an oblique railway projector, and with his father, they try to exploit Custer to act as their railway president so they can get funds. Finally, Libby, on behalf of General Sheridan, who was command of the army, bans him back on active duty as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the seventh cavalry a drunken party and is not surprised that Sharp commands the liquid at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first race with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn from "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him to jail. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes Custer's opponent and they fight. <br /> <br /> When Custer has rejected Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace deal with Sioux and other Indian nations. They also make sure that Custer is charged with charges of beating Taipe in a saloon fight. On the way to Washington, Custer discovers that Sharp and Taipe are ready to climb a gold strike in the sacred Black Hills. Settler's rage and Indians hit the warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6,000 red skins. "Stagecoach" booms Bert Glennon captures both gravel and glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry that leaves the fort at dawn is spectacular. As an addition to Custer's imminent death, Libby falls after leaving their Little Big Horn neighborhood. "The dead with their boots on" enjoy a top-notch Max Steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune "Gary Owen."
