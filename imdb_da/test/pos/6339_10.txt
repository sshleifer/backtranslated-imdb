Excellent episode, Dean showed not only good taste by choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but also showing that he has a heart and can love only a woman, and he is not just a guy who loves and leaves them! Aweso e episode. Applaud them on this one. I just hope that they somehow go back to the Cassie relationship next season (if there is a next season?) I would like to see her come back to their "supernatural" life, especially Dean. I also like that they chose an African-American woman to be the special lady of his life who somehow came away. I hope they won't turn up and finish it when he finishes. The girl who played Cassie was really a looking and it was good to see WB branch out into what we all see in everyday life - the interacial link that has become commonplace and acceptable (finally!)
