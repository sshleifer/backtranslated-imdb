This is one of the strangest movies I've seen for a long time. Usually if they are so strange, I save myself early and rarely care for it. Luckily I was doing this. Although I can't say this is a good movie (it's not), I can say that it looks a bit like a good acid trip - just a few really awful moments and the rest filled with "I really just saw ? " wonder. Lots of laughing loud moments. A great cast of characters with Meredith Eaton excellent as a dwarf sister-in-law with an attitude. Keep an open mind.
