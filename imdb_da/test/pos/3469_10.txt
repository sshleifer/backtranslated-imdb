Until I watched this movie, "life is beautiful" was my favorite movie all the time. This movie is all that a big movie should be. Great script, unparalleled acting and direction that is neither approaching the sentimentalism, the subject of temptation, nor leaving it without the emotional impact it requires. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from France. A wonderful movie even over caliber I have come to expect when I see the handmade movie logo coming up. I do not need to go into detail as the previous posts include everything that this film should be seen by everyone on this planet.
