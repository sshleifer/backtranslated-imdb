One of Starevich's earliest films portrayed in France may be his only political satire. The story of The Frogs Who Wanted A King reflects its title as a group of tall "croakers" believe democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from Jupiter to rule their country. When he sends down a stump, the frogs ask another king and say that the stump is "political tree". Jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time, whose seeds delight the eyes of the city's residents. As the original "croaker" is slipping down into the stork's beak, he speaks his morality: "Well enough alone." This movie features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of doll frogs. Starewicz tricks the audience into thinking that they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and only animating about six frogs or so at once. The slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in few places diminishes the quality of repetition, but its historical significance in Starewicz's life makes it important to see. His feelings towards the government immediately after his escape from Russia are probably expressed in this film. In addition, the technical results of animating so many signs at once in a stop movie are amazing.
