How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen, with huge affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as the normal life around me is something to judge. Romances, as mentioned earlier, are hardly ever earthquake issues that leave you at the top of the world or shatter and shatter. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its everyday life, which has lived millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you, ever so slow, probably without you even noticing it slowly takes over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love. Because if anyone did, I wouldn't believe him anyway, for no one, but I wanted to know. And even then it is just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you feel this exalting feeling. That you will have nothing but the best for someone that you will never see them suffers a moment of grief. That you are willing to take a great deal of pain for them. I would not go as far as saying to be willing to die for your loved one, for we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us. <br /> <br /> Is love between the movie's main characters ever so subtle and discreet, no less noble than the one between Romeo and Juliet? The undisputed feelings, the invisible feelings, convey far more than any repetitive shouting for "I love you". The restraint caused by the main actor always appeared so pointed in the scene where he sees his love interest through the cafe window, but never moved to make himself known to her, was simply heartbreaking to see. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden, knowing that her feelings and feelings could not be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> On another note, how should I handle my own particular death? While I can claim to have been seriously ill, I cannot honestly say that I have ever been close to death. Will I be so calm, put all my affairs in order, and leave instructions to others to take up what I leave behind? I suppose I want to be calm because I want some choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can empathize with the fear, knowing that your life is lost, that fate has given you a deadly blow, and that future events, how little is left of them, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing but a series of small events whose culmination may seem good to some in retrospect. But only very rarely.
