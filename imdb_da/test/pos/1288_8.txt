The debut, which picked from turmoil, is one of the brighter stars in today's noir, which is secured if it is limited, staff at con game and occupation. Filed for zero money, Nolan could not have chosen a better topic than the dull and nifty sub-side of London to trade because of the lack of funds. This short (67 min.) Is best at playing with the expectations of the audience and the protagonist who scamming who, even though the initial setup calls some alarm bells into the credibility card. The muddy cinematography (often used for natural lighting because of budget) can mostly be criticized for noir stylization, although the limitations sometimes show. One can easily see that Nolan's style develops in this exciting effort; many of the same themes for blurred identity and expectation turn back into MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. Not a masterpiece, but good and certainly a visit for modern noir and Nolan fans.
