Although I accidentally took this movie with me (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid eh!)) I was surprised at how good it was, many successors just kept the events from the previous movies, but it tried and managed to explain the events of the prequel, why murder Michael Myers people, and how does he seem to have supernatural abilities. I thought this was a top horror movie full of action, excitement and surprises, I'm very glad I brought it. I've given it 9 out of 10.
