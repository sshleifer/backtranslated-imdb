In the patriotism of the 1980s, and in some cases flat Jingoism, was quite high. "May we win this time," a line famous from Rambo: First Blood Part II, could almost sum up how many people felt at that time. A longing for the style of movies they grew up with, flat out balls for the wall "We're good, your bad ... Let's now blow something up and go home" While Rambo, Rocky and mostly Top Pistol seemed More geared to attracting an older crowd Iron Eagle went straight for the kids. Canadian author and director Sidney J Furie brings out everything you love and hate about that period. The syringe in the pants jumps over 80 songs (never say die, Gypsy Road, etc.) for the top and sometimes almost incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle succeeded for a reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous 80-minute moment. You don't have to think about whether it could really happen, or if the action is really credible, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie ...
