In a time of predictable films where there is abundance of violence, cheap romance and melodrama, it is wonderfully surprising to find such a strange movie. The plot itself is convincing, and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to see a movie that doesn't give all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (good or bad), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is worth ... especially at the end, ladies ....
