Perhaps one of the best films ever made. Orry and George's friendship run deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. As a Southern, I can honestly say that this epic is just as accurate as it gets. Brothers are fighting brothers. Can you imagine what life has been living in these times? The best part of the movie, for me, was when South sewed; General Grant urges President Lincoln to really hold it to the south, he says, "Mr. President, many want the South to bleed over what they've done ..." President Lincoln turns to him and in a very tired voice says: "The South has soft enough ... and we also ..." I burst into tears and deep weather. What a president! It's like a father says his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger, he understands that his point has been made. This war was a very dark time for our young country and it had to be fought. President Lincoln knew this. I encourage anyone reading this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection. So thank God that our country was preserved. As Jesus said, a "house split against itself cannot stand."
