The "North & South" TV mini series is, until the 1980s, what "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first television series) was to the 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy of author John Jakes. History covers the two decades until the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the impending proclamation of the Civil War - North to the South. The coherent stories evolve around the families of the dangers ("the North" in the title) and the Mains and their two main characters of George and Orry, forming a friendship, starting their West Point training in 1842. <br /> <" North and South "is a wonderful historical timeline, and as I have grown older (and wiser!) I am very interested in learning about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as" Slavery "and" Abolitionists "and how these attitudes derived from. The series also depicts a great character development that we learn about friends and enemies in George and Orry's life, and also the women who stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic narrative set on the turbulent background of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "North and South" along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" is exceeded by 1977's "Roots" as the biggest mini-series of all-time. But it comes close to the second / third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "Roots". But don't let this get away, even if it's just watching the amazing scenes, costumes, and brilliant stars, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. The series is beautifully crafted and closely related to actual historical events, and it is a pity that Emmys and Golden Globes did not honor much more of the actors and actors for their depictions. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual unknown lead actors at that time, touring in convincing performances such as Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, Kirstie Alley's easier performance as Georges' Abolitionist's sister Virgilia, who steals the show many times. Plus, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff like Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North & South" Books 1 & 2 are now available on two DVD sets.
