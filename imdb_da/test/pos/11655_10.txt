Susan Sarandon is unbelievable for a better word. In my opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars for her credit. I think it was a fantastic achievement in Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think every performance of her is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was it about ??? And when she got this oscar, she had been in the business for about 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who deserved it any more, especially for a performance as brilliant as her depiction of Sister Helen Prejean. But then she's all over Hollywood's artistry and doesn't need an oscar - people know she's good anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie carries some very deep, thought-provoking messages, so needless to say it shouldn't be taken lightly. Of course, Tim Robbins can't escape credit here. You would think that because of his people's feelings against the death penalty, the pictures in this movie would not be correct. But both sides of the death penalty debate get equal weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side, who witnesses his death rather heartbreaking. At the same time, you see the way he missed his victims and the constant torment of the understandably saddened parents. A word to Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant movie and, as I said, a well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar for Susan.
