With boundless, raw energy and an uncompromising vision, Talk Radio explores brilliantly the public's love of reducing strangers' private radio issues. Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude, in-face speech radio host. He is a natural for this kind of role and fine-tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on the screen. Timing and delivering his insults to his various calls is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is also shining as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he will later show in 1992 Glengarry Glen Ross. But the supportive role that really stands out is the stony, apparently brain-killed teen, played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job of photography, which is almost exclusively limited to a single TV room. The claustrophobic feeling of the film perfectly reflects its tone. One of the main points of the film, after all, exploits people's private moments to draw an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. Talk Radio is a movie with a strong emotional and cerebral effect - which is rarely seen today.
