"Lackawanna Blues" is so emotionally powerful in its depiction of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness that is specific to working class blacks that existed outside of ordinary culture. The characters in the Santiago-Hudson game portrayed black people who lived imperfect lives, but maintained strong positive values ​​of love, loyalty, and honor. Although the characters moved away from these values ​​at times, they did not deny the importance of values. Instead, they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and the other signs, without judgment, which went through the life of "nanny". The key characters were strong and credible, the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories from time to time. Forintegration city life was a time of sensory poisoning, sight, sound and smell that could almost be experienced by seeing the drama "Lackawanna Blues" unfold. I want to see it again and again.
