This time, the gracious dimwit is called to the jury duty, where a corrupt lawyer states that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out so the two are changed. Of course, most of the film is a series of gags; in "Ernest goes to prison", most gags relate to electricity. I really liked the whole vacuuming sequence early. Overall, the point of the movie is just having fun, and I'm sure you will. This is possibly the ultimate movie you see with a bud. It is certainly to say that Jim Varney will really be missed. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other cast member I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb who played Lyle. You've probably seen him somewhere.
