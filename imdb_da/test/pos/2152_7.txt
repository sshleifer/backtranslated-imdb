Biodoc on the enigmatic singer / songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life apparently on a mission of self-destruction. He died at 52, obese and scattered by heart disease after a prolonged rage with largely non-stop overindulgence in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, raucous partying and fluttering abuse of his vocal instrument (he entrusted a friend that he cried his lyrics on a performance with such power that the sprayed blood was left on the microphone). All this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely regarded as perhaps the most gifted pop of his generation's songwriter (2) successful after years of efforts in industrial recognition - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent entry-level contract with a top label and at least two star locations - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (originals) and 'A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night' (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time) with a lovely young family whom he seemed to love. <br /> <br /> The film's forces begin with the completeness of its account of Nilsson's life, including good use of archive footage and many still images of Nilsson; The editors do a particularly good job of bringing movement to the still images. We learn about his close ties to John Lennon and later, Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). Even more impressive are the talking heads, often a documentary's weakest aspect. Here we get people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams who tell amazing stories about Nilsson ?? many incredibly funny, others deeply pathetic - and all convey their deep love to him. Just informative and moving are interview segments with Nilsson's wives ?? Annie and Una, his son Zach, and cousin Doug Hoefer. Best set of heads I can remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The sharpest shortage of the film is that it cuts out Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his biggest hit, "Without You", is cut shortly after approx. 8 bar. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is. Lose a few headshots and we could have heard at least the song through, and maybe one or two, like "One" or his Oscar winning cover of "Everybody's Talking." "The filmmakers are simply intent on VVS Nilsson's psychological mystique and not enough attention to his music. My grades: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (Seen on NWFC's Reel Music series, 01/07/07)
