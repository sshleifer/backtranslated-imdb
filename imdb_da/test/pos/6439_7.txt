The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients in a potentially wonderful film. It is based on a charming book by Charles Kingsley. It has a truly talented cast from James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention David Jason and Jon Pertwees vocal talents. There is also Lionel Jeffries, director of fantastic classics like The Railway Children and The Amazing Mr Blunden, and while the movie is good at most, it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performances, especially Mason and Tomblinson like Grimes and Sir John Harriet, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible as Tom and Ellie. Voting is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, who expresses charming characters in itself. I also liked the random music, it is so scary and beautiful, and the manuscript was pretty faithful and generally well-written, especially in the beginning. The characters, especially the water kids are very charming, and the bad guys are vicious and fun at the same time, I loved the part when Tom and his friends help the water kids escape when the shark chases the electric eel with an ax was very fun. However, I would say that the movie looks dated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts were not that bad if you forgive the pretty dark camera work. The character animation was pretty flat, and the background was sometimes a bit boring, although there were some good moments, like the stage with Krakon and of course the first meeting with the kids. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, Water Babies song was beautiful, but I found the first song forgettable when Tom ends up in the water. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that is like marmite, you love it or hate it. I don't personally know what to do about this song, it was fun to listen to at first, but when it is in your head, it might be annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction lacked just the wonder and the magic it usually does. All in all, certainly not a horrible movie, but could have been better artistic. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
