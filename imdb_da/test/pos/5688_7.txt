I had never heard of this Aussie horror prior to Michael Elliot's enthusiastic review; In fact, after reading it, I decided to check if the DVD was available on my local rental plug and that was (albeit a German version ie sense R1 extra) so I chose to check out the movie immediately. <br /> <br /> While I wouldn't go as far as giving the full marks ?? only a few titles get them from me, let alone a fuzzy modern flick ?? I must say I was totally impressed by BLACK WATER. Instead of looking back at previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it recalls two who saw a small group of people walking on a trip lost and compassionate the elements and the creatures inhabit the place ?? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), even a slightly seen but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact, simple plot movie involves a couple and the woman's younger sister choosing to go fishing in a distant and banned part of the Australian desert, known as the crocodile area; very soon (actually before even 15 minutes have passed!) their boat is cut and the wizard killed by an alligator ?? so our happy adventurers take refuge in a tree. DVD Talk reviewer believes the movie suffers from spending too much time on this one site ?? with the three arguing what to do, trying to retrieve the boat, seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to be met with anything other than water) and occasionally attacked by the monster. But I think the decision makers take the situation as far as possible without slipping into the tedium: it is due to the trustworthy excitement and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (especially the two women), but also the fact that the crocodile here make it one of the scary and most memorable in the latest memory (I wonder how they got it to 'perform')! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the movie contains some really effective bumps ?? the alligator jumped out of the water to take a bite on the petrified heroes; The head suddenly arises in front of the women they make for the boat; even if one of them reaches the vehicle, the monkey manages to lift his massive weight and get into the boat with her! at the end, when the same girl manages to find a gun (on the missing body of their guide), puts it and lies in wait for the alligator to show up, the latter sneaking from behind her (incidentally, the creature is donated with the shark's breakdown in JAWS [1975]). With this in mind, the final is just as crowd-pleasing (although of course the smaller scale) like the classic Spielberg blockbuster ?? Although it has a downbeat follow-up. Another particular asset is the movie's sparse score? which is generally pretty nice but gets unnerving in just the right moments. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER appears as a fresh breath in view of the demoralizing decline in which horror cinema has fallen too late For this reason alone, the greater exposure deserves to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real necessity of making use of gimmickry in a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to order attention)?
