I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the Greek first episode, I couldn't wait for next week! I don't miss the show for nothing! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU GOD TO THE DVR! LOL I am in love with Cappie ... he seems like a bad boy, but he is so sweet ... Everyone has their own character, so we have pretty much all kinds of people. You could still throw in a Spanish and a fiery person. <br /> <br /> I didn't go to school in the US so I never liked the idea of ​​frat houses and things like that so when my husband told me about the show I wasn't aware of until he asked me to See it, and since I hadn't noticed better to do, I agreed. I laughed so hard the first night that I just needed to watch it. <br /> <br /> So .. I'm with the other people who voted for this show to continue! I hope for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! It is a really good show, very fun and entertaining!
