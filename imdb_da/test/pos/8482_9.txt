Like almost everyone, I'm familiar with Ray Charles's music. Who hasn't heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other amazing songs featured in this movie. But unfortunately I was ignorant of Ray Charles's life until I looked at this. I must say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly. His performances were powerful, down to fashion and vocal motions. The film also offered an unblocked account of some of the trials and tribulations that Charles dealt with during his life, and with some demons from the past who haunted him well in adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin retreat scene, which was painfully realistic. The film portrays Charles' growing awareness and involvement in the civil rights movement that culminated in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in Georgia, which led to a ban on him performing in the state. His drug addiction and extra matrimonial matters are also well documented. The film is about a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't let anyone or anything make you a cripple. "The point is that drugs did just that, and to honor his mother's memory he had to beat them. There's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin, but until then, this is really powerful thing.
