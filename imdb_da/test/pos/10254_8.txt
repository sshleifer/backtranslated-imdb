... instead see it as a great upcoming age story of African-American men in the mid-1960s in Chicago's ghettos. For all of you out there under the age of 50, "What Happening" was a light hearted, rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) on a group of young African-American high school students living in a working class neighborhood. I liked it a lot - it just has no real connection to this movie. "Cooley High" began to be the basis of "What Happens", but the serious character did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, although the credits on "What Happens" still read that it was based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie begins light but touches many aspects of life that are unique to the turbulent 1960s and also some other aspects of the adult that are timeless. The boys deal with sex, fraud, joblessness, hopelessness and even early death. The end is pretty strong and serious, and the movie has a good Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and also played in the few venues for these movies.
