I recently bought this movie for three bucks in a garage sale, and while I'm glad I didn't pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> It is created as a horror rhetoric, divided into 5 stories, including the "connector" story involving four teenagers whose car breaks down a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. Apparently these kiddos like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until morning - tell scary stories about a bonfire. Each character takes their turn tells a story, after which their own story is packed with a nice little twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook" is a bit of a waste of time, a little boring and boring. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and lasts only 5 minutes. It is intended solely to introduce the film, and it is easy to overlook the non-originality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners", is okay. It's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! They travel around in an RV led to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but they are quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location or risk being attacked by some dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good setup, but just an "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty entertaining and mysterious until the monsters show up, so it's just pretty good. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too" is my personal favorite. It involves a young girl whose parents go out at night, and who is older sis, forms her a party. So, she's going to be all alone - a fact she's acquainted with an internet friend of her. Problem is that your internet friend? Is not exactly a thirteen year old girl. This story's conclusion is a little less climatic than I might have seen, but still pretty good. <br /> <br /> The final story, "The Locket" is definitely the full of the most evocative atmosphere. Seen in a cruel mansion on a dark rainy evening, it's a young man's tale (played by Glenn Quinn!), Traveling around a motorcycle that stumbled upon this house right at the time he has a problem with his bike. He meets the dumb girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first glance. Unfortunately, not all is fine and dandy - and it may have something to do with the lock hanging around her beautiful neck ... After the stories are wrapped up, we are presented with a twist involving the four teenagers in the car, a twist that In thought, it should have been obvious, but it doesn't really seem to come, and that is quite a satisfactory conclusion for film. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie. Rent it if you can, unfortunately I don't really think it has a very new value. But next time you are in the mood for a vaguely scary litte flick in the same vein as "Tales of the Darkside" or something, take this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and indulge in this surprisingly nifty little flick.
