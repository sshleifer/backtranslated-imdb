I expected this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher / gore movie. Most deaths are sufficiently brutal. The teenager is decent, with Penny McNamee absolutely the best of the pile. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie beyond that. Kane was good as a killer, and is absolutely credible as a terrible juggernaut. I saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really stood out for me was the direction. Gregory Dark can actually have a career in legit movie in front of him. Except for using the horror movie "speed cam" (you know where the guy's face shakes quickly)? There are some good shots here. The camera's angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size, making him look even bigger than he really is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for deep stories or signs, this is not the case. But it's not about slasher movies. If you're looking for some good violence, or if you're into gory movies, check this out!
