Well, where do I start ... As one of the other reviewers said, you know you're in for a great treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of movie time spent on a guy standing at a tour operator. <br /> <br /> I don't want to repeat Rubin's excellent summary of the story. What I want to say is that this movie grabbed me more than any movie I can remember. I sat open and on the edge of my seat all the way through. The camera's work, soundtracks and * amazing * performances (especially Tony Servillo) draw you to the screen and won't let you look away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so of course everyone looks great, but it's not just a cool style exercise. This is a movie with lots to say about luck, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go see it.
