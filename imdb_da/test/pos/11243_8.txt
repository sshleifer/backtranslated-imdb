It looks like there are only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it's certainly fun to watch. You may find yourself in your chair, while the friend holds the mouth and gets shot down or chuckling and shakes his head when some ridiculous lines actually work. The panel of hosts has more of a good-natured, kind (dare I say Canadian) style of comment compared to cutthroat US reality programming. I think the people complaining about this show will not get the joke. They take the show more seriously than the show takes itself. Keys to VIP are a great cartoon of reality shows, sports TV culture and club scene. I hope they do another season and I would be interested to see if a US version is showing. It is definitely a fun, original premise.
