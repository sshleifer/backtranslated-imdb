I remember watching the trailer for this movie when it was first released, and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it myself. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should see it. After all, I loved the "Silence of the Lamb" and the "Se7", and if you liked these movies, you might get a kick out of "The Cell". The whole concept of history is very interesting. Going physically into a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in. The action is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say, it wasn't that big, but she does a credible job. I would recommend for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
