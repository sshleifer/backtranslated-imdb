I got to see this movie in my French class as part of the lets say "French culture". I thought the way it was filmed, and editing was really good, but for the most part it was entertaining especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. The story was also really good, as good as it was credible and yet adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: When William does fun with the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not that good, but with the subtitles I could pretty much get what was going on. <br /> <br /> SEE IT!
