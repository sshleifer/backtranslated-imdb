This is a very realistic movie. It's the most realistic I've seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I want to watch more movies by Gomez. I had never heard of the movie before anyone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I haven't seen anything come close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. This comes really close - in fact, a scene where there is an accident (I don't want to spoil and give details), reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. First I thought Gomez took the stage from the real life event, but then I realized that he made the movie a few years before that situation. I also agree with the point that this film did not attempt to extend its appeal by putting in the Hollywood crap. Gomez also instructed "Gravity's Laws" - I'm eager to see it.
