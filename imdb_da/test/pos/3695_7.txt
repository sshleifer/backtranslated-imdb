Without going into detail about a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... television movie, there seems to be agreement among the users that there is "no one to blame here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, can be young and horny and look good because he doesn't get as much as he wants from mother, it doesn't mean he can climb to bed and having sex with daughter OK, he can use the excuse, he just wanted to watch television with her, but I didn't buy it. People must take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he "cross" by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager when he was apparently "the responsible adult", he said: "Your mother must never know about it." How responsible was he then? Yes, it's a good flick, but he got what came to him. Children didn't even people that what happened was "no fault".
