Realistic Master Piece. Thirty years later, the pictures may look a bit old, but in fact, it is only the movie that 'fists in the face' effect. I've never seen a movie like this in my whole life. The first time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction ... And it didn't look ... That movie is a masterpiece that every person in the world should see. It is the best socially critical film. The ultimate movie showing that the system is down. And the system hasn't changed much for thirty years. I think this movie should be seen as a piece of education.
