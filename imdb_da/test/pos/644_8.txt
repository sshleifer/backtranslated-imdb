I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is ok as a fiance, but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having seen her in WITCHBLADE, I was not prepared for the sheer, unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches on the screen. I'll watch this movie again .... if only for Yancy Butler like Corrinne!
