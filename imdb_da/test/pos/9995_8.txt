As you know, "The greatest game ever played" is about golf. I used to sneak over the dramatic title, but through a large visual screen credited director Bill Paxton (better known for his performance in Twister and hilarious support roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find that this has much more significance than one game. Although the movie is about golf, it seems that the sport is just the setting for what really happens. What really happens is a story that individuals are told they cannot fulfill their dreams, be they age or social status. A conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands. An English golf legend seeks to bring the title home with the country, breathing down the neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a goddess's talent, who was never allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the opposition from the upper class "gentlemen" it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What constituted a major threat was his father's discouragement, which Elias Koteas played (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) who felt playing a simple game would never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of her mother, Francis finally comes face to face with his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself was the film's cinematic performance. This turned out that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The whole movie could have been told without dialogue. There are scenes in the movie that build strong tension and strong feelings with only images. On a particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the whole crowd turns their heads to see the ball flying into the distance, all but Harry Vardon's face looks intensely at Ouimet without a grinch. The ways in which golfers visualize the course provide more aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A comfortable supporting casting completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and seems to be worth playing for, and Josh Flitter plays a lovable caddy who keeps Ouimet focused as he presses him down. Golfing or not, you will appreciate the movie for its beauty and its reminder that the cinema can be a good medium to tell the story.
