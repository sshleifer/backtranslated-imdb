Just saw it as a movie from the Austin Film Festival. Enter, one had seen a few excerpts from their action at the Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was entertaining, but I did not expect such epic theme music, and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Beware that cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the dark gentleman himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. The car trip was by far my favorite scene. I know this will serve cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans just like me. I hope it does well in the theaters.
