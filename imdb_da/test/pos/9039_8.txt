As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college, I was especially happy to see burglar in the dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also known as Clarence Brown as director, grew up in the Oxford area, where he was born near 1888. We participated in a week long family reunion in Oxford in July 1964 just 15 years after the film. It still looked mostly like it does in the movie, but went through a period of civil restructuring, then as Ole Miss's site. My memory is that it is a lovely little college town that summer, but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. I was just beginning to see the injustice of separation and prejudice, but still had a long way to go. In any case, the movie is worth watching, but the filmmakers must have had a tight rope to get it done there, and I want to know more about that story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Oxford is a bigger and more modern college town with all the diseases that go along with such things, and I hope to return again to see how it has changed socially in the last 40 plus years. Juano Hernandez would certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year, but Hollywood was still too big to let it happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed, so look for them and compare. One of the best was a PBS treatment by The Barn Burner from around 1985 or so with starring Tommy Lee Jones. It really caught the intensity of rural southern whites, as Faulkner wrote so sharply about so often.
