The Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and I never missed a chance to catch his adventures on Saturday morning again running in the mid-1950s. Somehow this movie got me until I got the chance to catch it today with kind regards from my local library. I was hit by a number of elements during the story, right from the start you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a nicely expanded role, though he takes his share of lumps all the way through, gets beaten and shot more than once. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that Ranger actually kills in some situations and puts his character at odds with the vision created for the television series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to wound or protect himself and others . <br /> <br /> Apart from that, you have a fairly traditional Western adventure. Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are murdered by hooded raiders trying to track five medallions, which together make up the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the evil guys is an already wealthy woman disarmed by Noreen Nash. Her top henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was not surprising to see Lane Bradford as one of the evil ones. Bradford's character was one of the men who was shot by Lone Ranger, who made me think about how many times that could have happened in the TV series. A quick check revealed that he appeared in the 'The Lone Ranger' show fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps most interesting about the image is that it is an attempt to depict Indians in a revisionist light at a time when television and film-westerns still portrayed the red man as an illiterate. Dr James Rolfe's character (Norman Fredric) is the most obvious in that respect; He is an Native American who has obtained an education and continued to become a physician returning to his tribe in order to take advantage of the needs of all citizens. In connection with the story, he had to imitate a white man who was accepted by the local ranchers. This was the hardest thing for me to accept about the story line actually, as Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the older Chief Tomache (John Miljan). The fact that no one in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew that he was really an Indian was part of a stretch for me. I suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age, but without the background story flying out, it didn't make sense to me that no one else from the tribe would know who he was. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I'm fascinated by this so much, but having seen and reviewing over two hundred Westerns on this site, I've suddenly come across three movies in the last month that using a blanket pulling gimmick as one performed by Tonto's horse scout in this image. Roy Rogers' Trigger made a similar stunt in 1952's "Son of Paleface" and I caught it again in 1958's "The Big Country" of a horse named Old Thunder in that flick. It's done as a bit of comic relief in a situation that wouldn't normally come up for a horse, and that makes me curious now that the bit might have been the first time. I have to keep an eye on Western age. Not to be outdated, Silver also had the opportunity to shine in the picture and rescued an Indian baby who was to be used as a hostage by the bad guy Brady. <br /> <br /> Talking about gimmicks, Clayton Moore borrowed a TV series tactic when he donned a disguise as a southern gentleman to smoke out the bad guys posing as hooded raiders. When he wanted to do that in the half hour format, it was always smart enough to hide his real moves, usually with a beard done here. One of the more interesting episodes I remember had to do with Ranger, who was an actor in the deck of Abraham Lincoln. Watch for a few goofs, I looked out on the road. In an early stage of the opening, an Indian shot of one of the hooded raiders is, and close up there is blood on his shirt, but not a ball hole. Later in history, Ross Brady and Wilson ride up the Indians after they have kidnapped one of the villains out of prison. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying raiders, but is immediately shown to make his escape into the horse with Wilson.
