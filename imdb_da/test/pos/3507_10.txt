"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher movies.It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of Tober Hooper's 'Texas chainsaw massacre' and 'Deliverance'. Deborah Benson very good plays heroine and director Jeff Lieberman created very creepy and dark film. "Just before dawn" is beautifully photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I have never had joy movies or do except with this one. Very impressive and compelling movie (at least for me)
