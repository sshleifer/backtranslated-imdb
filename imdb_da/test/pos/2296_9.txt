Much of the comments seem to treat this movie as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary. It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds. <br /> <br /> I spent a couple of years in Japan and I assume that this movie didn't make it good for you to have experienced Japan to get it. I saw this with a well-attended friend who has never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolutely unworthy truth about life in Japan! I think this movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you have lived in Japan or are interested in it.
