Finally!! Sandra Bullock is actually a beautiful woman, but I've finally found a movie that she gets to be an actress! Forget the predictable Keanu feed of SPEED, forget about the predictable Kleenex feed while you were sleeping - this tests her! <br /> <br /> And she's amazing! A techno-feminist role that really works well on the screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. The troubles raised do not seem to have been removed, and the whole experience, helped with a nice cast, makes it quite unpleasant a couple of hours. Never enter another chat room again, in fact I get quite nervous just writing this review ... is ... goodbye!
