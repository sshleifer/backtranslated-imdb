This is an excellent movie. There were several parts to the movie I liked. This movie is very fun! Visit Ernest Sjovklub's website at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several movies as follows: Ernest goes to Camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to prison, Ernest in the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest, etc. I recommend strongly these for family movies. All star Jim Varney is trying again to visit www.ernestfunclub.com Which is the best Ernest movie? In my opinion, there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Prison. So if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell's time go and see him. You will find him quite satisfactory "no what I mean"?
