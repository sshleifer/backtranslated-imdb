First, alien saves a little black boy as well as a Mexican, despite what the IMDb plot collection suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fancies, racial rapeseed. The protagonist of this movie is a George Michaelesque dope who does not understand primary human intrusion as drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem, he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene when writing the band members is a letter stating whether they want the 500 bucks they come from the Reading Center for protection they will meet with him. At the meeting he is surrounded by countless Chicano gangsters, but he holds a cool head. In slow motion he stops the wooden post from a stop sign that is crushed by contact. Then, still in slow motion, pointing to the leader of the gang and saying, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" Group members adhere to. Cool, don't you? The beauty of this film shows in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
