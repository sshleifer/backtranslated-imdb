My yardstick for measuring the watch's watch ability is if I get twig. If I start to change positions and notice that my beard is sore, the film is too long. This movie didn't even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts, but never boring. All the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the coast guard too? They are totally undervalued until the day your boat sinks, that is. The movie was very fun and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who does not know when to finish. However, I was most impressed by Ashton Kutcher's performance. I never wanted him, never seen any of his TV shows and always considered him immature. Well, punk. In this movie he does a good job! He is well on his way to having leading man status. I think the movie we showed should have been a staggered cut or something, for about 2/3 of the way in, the film material was very grainy, the sound level dropped and the microphones were looked down over the whole place. Also on display were representatives of the movie looking for audience feedback - especially on the parts of the movie we didn't like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave worried a few lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pack her stuff up and move out. He says, "Maybe I should be the one to move out." And she answers, "No, you don't know where there's something in this house, I should be the one to go." This doesn't make sense: if she knows the layout as well, Costner is right, he * should * be the one to leave.
