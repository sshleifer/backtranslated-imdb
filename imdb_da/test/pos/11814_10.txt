When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and beside him he is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns that Dexter has AIDS, he tries to leaf and water tea to do better. But when the frontman of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys in nothing will stop to come to New Orleans for cure. <br /> <br /> In my opinion "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendships ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend and his best friend's mother. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 to be a great friendship movie, but it is also a sad but humorous and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale of Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me throw a tear. Very well done.
