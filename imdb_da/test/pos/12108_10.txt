Crossing the Bridge: The sound of Istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience as it ended and deserved it. I don't expect too much of a musical documentary, but the film turned out to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary from Istanbul with sharp contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photographs of ancient Istanbul by the world-famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But of course, the main theme was music, and by God how many different things! It was in a way similar to the Bueno Vistas Social Club; love and respect for the interviewer -Alexander Hacke here replaces Ray Cooder-for the musicians radiating from the screen and engulfing us all. The music was mostly very interesting. The jazz session of a group of Roman hypocrites in a small western Turkish town was thought-out. I'm not surprised if travel agents begin receiving group requests for Kesan after the movie is released. But I loved most of the Muzeyyen Senar, who looked incredibly elegant in a kind of burlesque way, and while she tipped "Raki", he bravely said, "My voice and I'm 86 years old!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who feel abandoned: Go to Volume II, thank you.
