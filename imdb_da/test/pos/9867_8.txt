I personally love this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. I have found, after seeing it with many friends, that you enjoy it altogether or find it totally unbearable. Personally, I've seen it dozens of times, and it never gets old. There is a big back story in the movie itself, and a lot of different things are finally explained. It's a pretty short movie that's just shy for 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting trip. The form seems to be pretty brutal in this movie, but the play is still there with the way he goes, stems and kills. There are many nice little screenshots with Micheal that appear in the background, adding more of a creepy element to the movie.
