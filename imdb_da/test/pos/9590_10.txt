I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy I've been waiting for on DVD. I got it on VHS and got so tired and waiting for a release and worrying that my VHS copy would ruin, I got the equipment to get it on DVD. The picture and the sound are excellent for my complete surprise. If someone wants a copy, drop me a line at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7.00 I'll put it on a DVD, print DVD ' one and get it in the mail for you. £ 7.00 covers only my costs and busy delivery etc. With maybe a little over so I'm not after making money out of it, I just want the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy. I have recently seen a copy of ebay got for over £ 26, great. How can they not release this classic. Email me for payment details like check or Paypal etc. Etc.
