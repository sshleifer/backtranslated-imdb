Latcho Drom is a cinematic study of gypsy music from several countries. It is touching, sad and pleasing. Most of the segments appear to be completely unsteady, untouched. The music, ranging from the Spanish gypsy's sensual flamenco music, to the melancholy music of the Central European gypsies, is exquisite. If you love Gypsy music, you will find Latcho Drom beautiful. <br /> <br />
