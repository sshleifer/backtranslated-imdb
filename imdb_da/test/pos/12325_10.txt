I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I think this movie is the most "perfect" movie ever made. By perfect I understand the story, the plot, the play, the recording, the camera's work, etc. (This is a lay opinion, I have no background in film production.) Many movies have perfect scenes that the bartender submits a report with police officer in the movie Fargo. (Really, the scene could play well as a card.) In The Dead, all scenes are done to perfection, making the whole movie perfect. Maybe John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. Hopefully, Daniel Webster has got him out of the contract!
