I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, except the fact that many may not have seen it. It's a fantastic cast of characters, one after another after another, all made by the guy who wrote the play. If you don't like filmed plays, you don't like this (after all, it doesn't usually play well on TV), but it's a one-man show that wants you to pay attention all the time. Highly recommended.
