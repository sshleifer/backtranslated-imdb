This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a "cowboy" here. The film's appeal comes from its meticulous manipulation of atmosphere and theme. It is a gothic narrative set in the Civil War and as such, all the film's "action" or lack thereof in a house populated by southern callings of all ages and forms. The fear comes from seeing the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character. Seeing him stranded in the house and being held captive by the women is actually a very "soothing" experience. And who is "saddened" here exactly? Are the women saddened by Eastwood's incredible looks? Are we, the viewers, pursued by both his sexual allure and the potentially deviant sexualities, it releases? Or "beguiled" refers to what the instructor is doing here - keeping us excited about only a short space for (perhaps) let's go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing movies I had the pleasure of watching.
