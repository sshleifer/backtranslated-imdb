Before I saw this movie from start to finish, I just happened to catch the last half hour. Normally, I don't see a movie if I haven't seen it from the start, but a friend did it, and when I started to see it, I couldn't stop. I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a broad theatrical release. This is a pretty funny movie (often gallows humor), and the monster and monster car in it is pretty threatening. The monster makes Leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is like a cross between a German World War II artillery vehicle and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A thin twenty-five year old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves to get married. His ex-best friend marks continue and rags on him all the time. They are threatened on the road by a vintage black chain and the aforementioned monster car. They also pick up a hitchhiker played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also saw the animated trailer with the director's comments and the electronic press kit, and I found them both to be interesting. I bet the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is also quite enjoyable, but I have so many other movies to see I have never seen before ....
