I just watched this movie last night and I have to say I loved every minute. If it's taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond esquire movies, it's really superior. The true comedy of the film is in its obvious disregard for political correctness. The misogynic, cultural insensitivity and almost ridiculous macho-ism of the films in this genre are used for great comic effect. It also calls the illogical and formal elements of the task, with Agent OSS 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely fast (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetic obvious traces. Some of the lines from the movie left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished ... and I have to say I learned something ... interesting ... French vocabulary that would probably have my professors completely spoiled with me was I use. All in all, I thought this movie was excellent. Intense fun and the first movie I've ever seen that really parody all aspects of the spy movie.
