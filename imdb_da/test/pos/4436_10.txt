When Nathaniel Kahn entered this journey, he hardly knew who his father really was. At the end of the film he found him and expressed himself with the strange life he lived as a child. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was the father. He was the architect of the architect. His designs were perhaps too complex when trying to create buildings that were not in line with trends that were popular at that time. It is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easily to some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and he was never rejected by it. We can see the characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left as a legacy to humanity. Every one of his creations is unique because they do not mimic works from other architects. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn's life was quite complicated. He was married, but he had affair with two of his assistants who produced a girl and a boy, in addition to the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. As a boy, Nathaniel Kahn lived in a secluded area away from his father who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear that they all knew about the other existence. <br /> <br /> It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone in Grand Central Station when he returned from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never recognized as his own at his side. He probably used a great deal about all his children, but he remains a secluded figure throughout the film. We never know the man of man, but eventually Nathaniel finds in his quest to discover his father's life to find most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a personal account of the life of an artist. Thanks to the son who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost curious about Louis Kahn's life and his extended family.
