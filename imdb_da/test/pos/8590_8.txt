The story of how the (communist) leader liberating Congo from Belgian imperialism was eliminated by Western forces through Mobutu. A story of struggle and injustice, hope and freedom search. The story could be that of an African country. A very moving movie with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only have to watch a foreign film this year, see this.
