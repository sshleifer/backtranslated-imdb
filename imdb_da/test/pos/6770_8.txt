Not sure I have ever seen a black comedy from Denamark before, but it's pretty good indeed. The humor is appropriate low key and deadpan to go with some of the cruel activity. Svend and Bjarne are busy working for their boss because he always puts them down (he actually mentions that they were not bright enough to unpack before they pissed at a time). They do what they need to start their own butcher shop, and when a worker accidentally gets locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a candle, they hit something that makes their butcher shop much more popular than their old boss. In fact, he is the one they sold their first "fillets" to, and it is partly his fault when he served them on a rotating dinner in his house, and the guests raved about it and appeared at Svend and Bjarnes the next day. Bjarne is somewhat horrified by what Svend has done, but it doesn't stop there. Svend has risen above his sad little existence to be a person of some popularity who is new to him, and he will not get rid of it, so the freezer continues to fill up with all sorts of acquaintances (and at some point, "a little Swedish from the park"). However, suspiccions arise because ex-chief Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother Eigil, who this year has lived in a sanatorium in a coma, and who Bjarne wanted the plug pulled on, so he could get inheritance money to help open the store. When Eigil was taken out of respiratory protection, he was revived, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne also has a love interest in Astrid, who works in the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adjusted individuals, and therefore things start to spiral out of control. Deadpan humor makes it really, and even though this does not laugh a lot of material, it is certainly entertaining. It is a little scary, even though the cuts of meat and body parts are also taken into account, especially since these two take it all by themselves. If you are a fan of black comedies, this is recommended, I liked it myself. 8 out of 10
