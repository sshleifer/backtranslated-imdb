I see Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings happy times back to me. I grow up in a big city in the middle of the west. It reminds me when I was a kid, although my situation was a little different, it feels the same. It makes me wonder if everything we ever want to know about families is lost. Today's great mama is under 55 years old. Want to see what is needed to be inspiration to others. I hope I wasn't the only one who loved this movie enough to relate to their past. The music was amazing in this movie. I really felt this should have been to the theaters I would have paid to see it. As I looked at the movie for the second time, I found out where life this movie was about. He did a fantastic job in writing and produced this movie. I guess who better at producing a movie based on your life than you. As soon as I can, I will get a copy for my home use. I always enjoy the black producer or directors they make such movies, feeling that you actually lived in the time just like. Thanks for such a great movie.
