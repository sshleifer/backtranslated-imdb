I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it was only to set the mood and build up to the action. I thought this movie was very educational, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say that she has a huge impact on me. The magazine is called Louise Arbor one of the world's 100 most influential people in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who like historical movies (of course). This film was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero, and I'm glad they made a movie that honored her. If you see the movie, I hope you like it.
