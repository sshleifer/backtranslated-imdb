I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's really a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well-acted and I hate to mitigate it's quality). A comedic character study about the busiest in mid-life crises, the inequality of gay people who cannot recognize their long-term associations, and the general differences between people who cannot fit nicely into society, pairing Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett for a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert were to make another movie together. The anxiously-ridden, arid and outrageous mother-in-law, Maudie (Meredith Eaton), is a truly wonderful character. If you liked the Tales of the City movie, you would like this quirky charm.
