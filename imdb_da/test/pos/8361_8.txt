As much of the Twilight Zone episodes, one of my favorite parts of this was the open social comment that Serling does with history. As was the case with a recent episode "The Howling Man", I was reminded of my long-standing suspicion that if Jesus were to come to earth to bring his followers to heaven, he would immediately be sentenced for insanity and probably thrown into and asylum. Our protagonist in this episode faces a similar problem when we try to convince the 1860s Americans that he is from the future and President Lincoln is being murdered. The episode mistakenly claims that it means some parts of the past can change while others cannot, but it's a fun time traveling around. Nonetheless. We do not testify to a fact The story can be changed by time travel because time travel is never achieved and unfortunately will never be. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically place yourself in the past, you could physically prevent something from happening as long as you didn't flaunt like a lunatic shout of murder. <br /> <br /> One of the consistently interesting things about travel and TV shows is, in my opinion, the way in which the time travel takes place. There really is no method whatsoever here, our main character is to have a time trial conversation at a posh gentlemen's club and then go outside and into a dissolution from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but no matter . Twilight Zone has so far not hit me for its complex sets or high production values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays part of Peter Corrigan, the time traveler, and after discovering that he somehow has been transported back to the exact day in Lincoln's murder he manages to get thrown in jail, but fortunately for him John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, just happened to hang out at the police station and overheard the hectic Corrigan desperately trying to describe the actual murder the Booth planned for that night. Booth requests the custody of Corrigan for some psychiatric experiments, and the police officer sees nothing wrong with renouncing the custody of this guy. He had a business card, after all, how bad could he be? The view seems to indicate that you can change people's lives by slightly changing events in the past through time travel, and while I'm not willing to accept that time travel will include such limitations, it's still a fun episode that really makes you to think, which is one of my favorite features in the good twilight zone showing ...
