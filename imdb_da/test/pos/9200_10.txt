I don't usually comment on movies or TV shows, but had to write a comment about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course here in the UK we are about 2/3 through 3rd season and although I have managed to see the last series of season 3 (via other means) I still glue every Friday pm. 21:00. From the very first episode of season 1 I have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on DVD, yes I can't wait for season 4 to start in October. So why do I love this show so much, yes I agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know a person can't make a team, but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan, or maybe it was the other way around , I read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline .... Don't have it! ! I also agree that Caan's character becomes very soft, I also preferred the hard take not Big Big Eddy D, as we saw in Season 1 and 2, he seems to have softened. <br /> <br /> As I said no one makes the team of themselves and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda all well, even outside cast members like Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who can play 6 or 7 times during a season, can fit in as well as if they were in each episode from day one. <br /> <br /> This show has everything, drama, action, excitement, grin, romance, glitz, glamor, and big-time celebrity that often plays itself. Many may disagree, but it is one of the best shows on digital TV, and I hope it can take a long time after season 4.
