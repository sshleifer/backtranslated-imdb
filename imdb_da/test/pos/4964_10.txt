The music is by Stravinsky (and not by stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before the glass's unfortunate birth. Staging is simply extraordinary. The story in Japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff's version. The giant heads and hands are justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The props and make-up used for the plague are simply spotless. It's Taymore's best work. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge moves clean and clean, and Norman finds the right expression, and her beauty is magnified here and finds her right place: bigger than life. Just a must.
