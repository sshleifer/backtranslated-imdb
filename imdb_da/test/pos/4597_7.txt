As a social satire, the idiocrat is as good as Office Space, but with a broader scope. To criticize this movie as everything for pueril because of potty humor is that kind of miss the point, I think. There are particular ponds etc., but they are not really destined to be fun for the public - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world 2500 AD, visited by Joe, as the backdrop for the bizarre state of affairs, where he wakes up. The real humor of the film lies in the many views and attitudes present in this future society, which are just a shadow of what we encounter in our daily lives and which should be a warning. My personal favorite is the depiction of Fox News. The subtle brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it also engages in "wise" people, and average joes as the main characters. Notice the times in the movie when Joe and Rita are almost unconsciously in tune with the idiots around them, and you realize that idiocy is not created to pick any group of people, but especially on the idiocy's culture in general. I don't know what to say about the "made for conspiracy theory" behavior at Fox in the release of this movie, but if it doesn't play in your local theater, it requires it. We all need to watch this movie, if not for the social comment, at least for the fix jokes ...
