The enclosure of the earth is carefully constructed and perfectly played. A simple amazing journey out of our reality and into another era. Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute movie cranes travel to both Australia and the experience of the youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging early 19th century war when he heads for a Government position down below. <br /> <br /> Among the crew and the hopeful emigrants who share his passage is a stormy, bullying captain (Jared Harris), a political radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a newest lieutenant who has worked his way up from scratch (Jamie Sives) and fleetingly the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes at night. <br /> <br /> Except for the astounding degree of physical historical accuracy, director David Attwood and writers Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a keen eye for manners and stiff etiquette from a past, creating a truly compelling the microcosm of Napoleon's era. <br /> <br /> The ship's life is a brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor, and danger after another, and as Edmund becomes anchored in the love, hopes, and misery of his fellow passengers, he experiences a frightening whirl of the tribulations of life, man's inhumanity and his noble feelings. Those who enjoy master and commander: The far side of the world or Patrick O'Brin's series of novels on which it was based will love this ?? for everyone else it is a whole new world to discover.
