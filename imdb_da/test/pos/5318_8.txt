This should be one of the most powerful messaging movies I saw lately, it was completely flawless all the way, incredibly original and thoughtful. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a guy who kills his ex-boyfriend's retarded kid's brother and, as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks, you get hold of a story and you don't let it go all the way to the end. Murder he commits to changing the course of life for each family member and family of the deceased, and as you see and realize that everyone has their own story and its own dark side, you just appreciate this movie even more, it's a total tour the power because these actions cannot be described in simple words. His motive for committing murder is explained incompletely, and it makes viewers think. Action was pretty flawless, and the casting was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like the movies that are provocative and just make you think of them (eg 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.'), then 'The United States of Leland' is an excellent movie choice for You have to pass this movie and watch it when you are in the mood for serious thought-provoking movies. <br /> <br /> 10/10
