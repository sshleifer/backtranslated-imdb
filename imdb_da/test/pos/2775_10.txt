Susie Q is an original and is not like the other bad Disney movie, *** spoiler *** A boy named Zach moves to a new city and has problems in school, he's good basketball. a girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend when their car was crashed by a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) from power rangers - pink ranger helps Zach as a ghost to get a necklace under the way he has to explain his sister about her ghost, and finally to get this necklace, Susie returns to the bridge, she died on and then she comes in her boyfriend's ghost car and they float up. Later as he misses her, he finds a girl that looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to watch every now and then, but they hardly give up because Disney has to fill everything with silly movies and show that I give it a <br /> <br / > 7/10
