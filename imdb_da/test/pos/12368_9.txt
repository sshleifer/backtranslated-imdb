On New Year's Eve, the holy tuberculous sister of Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her death room. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David tells two other drunkards in the cemetery legend of Phantom Coach and his coachman: in accordance with the legend, the last sinner who dies in the New Year's turn, the soul gathers, gathers souls in his coach. When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coach arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of the last year. George resumes parts of David's unpleasant life, and in flashbacks he shows how sweet and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "The choir" is an impressive and stylish sound movie with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated, and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when sister edits tells that she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love such a despicable man who wasted her life to destroy other people? Despite being religiously dated in the present, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasy" ("Phantom Coach")
