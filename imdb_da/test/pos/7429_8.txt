A young girl becomes a war-time marines pencil, and when he visits the end of war, one expects a bit more "accessible" comic complications. Everything ultimately works fine, of course, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the landscape. Errol Flynn's dead impression of Humphrey Bogart from "Casablanca" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker being a revolt). However, it is Tucker who "tucks" the film under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the finish line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in "F-Troop" and provides a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays to increase his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job while the woman is pursuing, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's true penpals. A nice, lightweight "coming home" comedy in a tremendous setting that children and romantics of all ages must find entertaining.
