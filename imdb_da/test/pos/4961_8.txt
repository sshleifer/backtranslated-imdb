Being a D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been looking for this movie for some time. I recently rented the video and found it very fun. It had some really fun scenes. The dysfunctional lives of some of the characters were disturbing, but I think the movie also showed that it is possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it has been tracked.
