I loved this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a good spy spoof and who thought Johnny English was an embarrassing one. This is the movie JE should have been. But it's based on an old French movie series, so it's not really Bond related. <br /> <br /> Production is brilliant, you will almost believe the movie was shot back in the 60s. It even had the same pastel kind of color film these days. Jean Dujardin plays his part with just the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not with him fisted pantomime silliness as Rowan Atkinson. And even if you don't like the movie, you'd like to see it at Berenice Bejo. Ooh La La! She's hotness ...
