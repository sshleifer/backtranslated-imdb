No, I'm not talking to this one. He was the guest's reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this film positive characters. And who can blame him? This is a charming, optimistic and pretty fun Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody will be a cat sticking. It makes me snatch my fingers or something. Only years later, when Cats Do not Dance came out, I have seen a movie that was the musical fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and history, it pose for charm. Plus, everything goes at a leisurely pace and even the villain is not so scary. It's perfect for the younger set while you're not so juicy that adults don't like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yes. Dig these CRAZY cats, man.
