I watched this movie a long time ago, but it's still in my memory the horrific movie ever. I cried non stop. My mother will never see this movie again because it is almost painful to watch. Still, the story is not exactly complex ... Ann Margaret is dying and has to give her 10 (?) Children. As if it is not bad enough, it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one. I suppose this was very sad for me because I am also from a very large close-knit family and could identify with each child's pain leaving their mother and siblings. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I would like to watch this movie again because it was well done, and the end surprisingly is a bit happy (so at least we could smile and sob at the same time). It should come on TV sometime so I can see it again.
