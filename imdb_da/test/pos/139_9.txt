They say it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the viewer's imagination - to hide certain details from the audience to tickle their fantasy wind, immerse themselves in their fears, and feed it their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> That was not the case when I saw Bakjwi under the American title Thirst. Now play at selected theaters near you. It seems that the filmmakers will not save you anything. There will be blood in this movie and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi .html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.
