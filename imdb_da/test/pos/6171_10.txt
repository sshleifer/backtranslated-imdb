This is a beautifully crafted film that fine-tunes the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the warless battle. The use of outtakes from the Battle of Britain (a movie that is almost not so good, depicts the 1940s!) Enhances, rather than detracts from, everything. A deeply impressive work, this lived in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it, and I just bought it to investigate the extras. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie (movie). As "Aces High", it shifts between viscerally exciting (or frightening) air struggle sequences, where the viewer may experience actual loss of characters they will love, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground where talented writers and real life experiences inform some involving and moving events. This also underscores the fact that for many people in 1945 not only marked the end of a conflict but the beginning of another, and even today we still do not recognize the loss, maturity and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or yet Worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be people with all the emotional weaknesses involved - making their victims more valiant. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that takes you from the heights of friendship to the depth of jealousy and back to love that lasts even beyond death. If all war movies were like this, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it worth seeing? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
