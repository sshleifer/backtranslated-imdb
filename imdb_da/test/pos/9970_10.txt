I'm always impressed when a director (and this song director / screenwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it alive. Certainly, Shakespeare's text can give you goose bids, even when it is hammered by self-meaning, but seeing a production where true ingenuity makes wonderful words even more - by giving context or nuance not in the scene, the guide is simply impressive. There are many worrying things about the game. It's a racist game about racism - and it's still sticking. I have never accepted Jessica's desertion of her father for no acceptable reason. I have never accepted the attitude of Christians towards sanctimonious self-righteousness. But brilliantly, there is a text prologue that helps us understand the times and politics in which history is put in, and much of Jessica's part has been carved mercifully. <br /> <br /> The text is completely cut off with many passages cut. But I noticed only one line that was cut at the moment when I expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and judicial editing has given us a gripping movie - not just a movie of the play. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous to the unworthy / unrelated Bassanio - you can almost feel Antonio's heartbeat when he gets a glimpse of Bassanio, passing by in a gondola or visiting. But it's as subtle as that - no more. I was spellbound. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt the arguments during the attempt to be heartbreaking. And the lawyers' attempts are fun. <br /> <br /> Add all that to brilliant movies and costumes that resonate over time and you'll understand why I can't wait to see it again. And again.
