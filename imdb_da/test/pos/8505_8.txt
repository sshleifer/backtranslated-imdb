I first saw this the first time it was shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late in the evening, but partly because of the full sense of a video recorded voltage story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows himself). And the casting was so real. I hardly know Shane Briant from anything else, so it may not be so true to call HIM "good cast", but for me he is Dorian Gray. And as far as the other male actors are, the one who fits so well to his role, Nigel Davenport (who is so good at "greater than life" characters) like Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of Dan Curtis "repertoire player" at the time because of Dark Shadows. As a poster points out, this version handles the involvement with men in a rather subtle way. The scene in which Dorian recites a list of men's names on the character of John Karl, as a way of deterring him and the appearance of Karl's face, was very well done. (If that scene was made now, it would probably be done in a way that was disproportionate, and be bad at comparison.) I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was hardly a name for me, let alone more, so even more than the Famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is the version for me.
