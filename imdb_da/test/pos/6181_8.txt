It's about getting what you want when you want it. And the message from Bluebeard's eighth WIfe should be careful what you want until you want it. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard the stories of what happens when your sexual frustration is not relieved and some of your anatomy turns blue. Misogynist pirates sit, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very used to getting what he wants when he wants it, and learns too late that it was not what he expected and never learned his lesson until he runs into the celebrated Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marching / buying her for the purpose of bedding her, but she won't have any of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn and corner and space, and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The movie has certain French sensibilities, which means it has strong double entenders and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not used to (and don't like to see) in either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason I saw the movie was because they are "sympathetic" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they are unlikely people or at least sympathetic people who have developed unlikely features to protect themselves, they believe. world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on its own terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated movie ... and satisfaction as we said it is about. Such a film with such a casting comes only once in a ... ummm ... blue moon.
