This movie is about six men assigned to transport money from bank to business. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country, and now he is only helped by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) and does not lose his house. Mike tells him that this was not what his parents expected for him, and he should live a better life than he is with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Tells Ty that he and Jimmy have always been family to him and would do something to help them out, Mike Ty tells about a plan to make a hoist. The money would be about 43 million divided six ways among the other carriers too, though Ty doesn't like the idea he tells his friend Mike as long as nobody gets hurt, he would be in. The last night Ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady to put her brother in a nursing home and give him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed is not everything when it comes to life. <br /> <br /> When it comes to heists, either in or out, so when you don't go with a plan it's hard to play the hero and stop greed-driven people when it comes to having huge sums of money. This movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested in starring Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Recently, I only remembered him in "Stomp the Yard", which was about a child who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college. This was probably one of his best movies I've seen him in, and the one he fits the character as well, it's great to see him on the big screen again in action.
