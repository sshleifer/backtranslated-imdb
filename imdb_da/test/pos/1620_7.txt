As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non-Catholicism came in the way of my understanding of it. The Church has this mass of rules that have been composed over the centuries. We have a short time to teach them and accept them at face value. Then some bad guys are thrown into revenge for a distant action against them, working under these rules and trying to bypass them, and you have this book and movie. I thought to myself, "It's pretty cool, why did they do that?" There is this relaxed thing in the Robert Langdon character, no matter what the question is, he always seems to be doing the right first step. I suppose it's like watching CSI, where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the country's rent. In this movie there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that goes on. But if you create Robert Langdon, put him to work. It's OK because heroic nerds he has saved the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a marvel to look at and never stop for a second.
