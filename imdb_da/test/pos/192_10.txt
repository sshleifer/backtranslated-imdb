Mikhail Kalatozov's cranes fly is a great movie. Winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, it has an excellent film and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor ever to win a prize in Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and worried, with plans to get married. Her life will come upside down when World War II hits and her boyfriend volunteers for the army. The film depicts the effect of war on a teenager's love and on the people who stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight and wait for a letter or other information. It is a depiction of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job, and her character transformation will break your heart. The camera's movement is fast with many close-ups, it's a dance camera. The first scene in the stairs is amazing, but it's not the only one that is later a scene when Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the bombing of Veronica's house as she drives the stairs in the middle of the fire to find her apartment completely destroyed. Simply amazing! 10 out of 10
