I just watched this movie for the first time today and just loved it ... Yeah, it's simple in its history, the sweetest love story, and how any woman couldn't fall in love with Callum Blue strikes me ... Italy's landscape was As you would expect, Beautiful, the evil eventually lost, and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end, was wonderful, but the scene where a certain Italian celebrated confetti after Eric and Wanda's wedding, perfection !. <br /> <br /> Have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, rather you have a tissue clear and thrilled, I know I was and hope to get it on DVD very soon. All the actors played their parts perfectly, it was a WW2 movie you could believe in as it was so realistic and without going over the top like in other movies ...
