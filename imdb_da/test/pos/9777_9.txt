I have heard a few comments, especially from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing. Perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through these things and much worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how prisoners were treated by Japanese during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if it had been, the historical accuracy aspect would have been decisive. It is a miniseries drama with fictitious characters and fictional situations (though it is loosely based on actual events I have heard and read about) - and in the middle of history is the idea of ​​mateship. This group of young Australian soldiers, captured by Japanese and held in appalling conditions for years, were mated by adversity and the strength of their friendships continued in their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese time and the Western world with its music, games and entertainment: in Part 5, when it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany surrenders in Europe, it Japanese prison campolonel insists that his country should study their prisoner's culture - to defeat a people one must defeat their culture - and to do this one must understand it. All in all, Australia continues with its rich tradition of producing extraordinary television miniseries and is an unrivaled world leader in this regard: the celebration of the AFI Award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel and also a worthy winner. Miniseries in recent years include the DAY OF THE ROSES (the story of the study of the Glanville train crash), KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (the adaptation of Mary Durack's historic story of his pioneering ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about a group of friends from a Australia's country village, traveling to London and changing and growing apart, and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, THE POTATO FACTORY. Less recently: Nancy Cato's sweeping story of life at Murray - ALL RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James' brilliant post-war novel in Sydney - COME IN SPIN; Colleen McCullough's outstanding groundbreaking story - THE THORN PEOPLE; RIVERKONGENE; Ruth Park's novel THE HARP IN THE SOUTH; Body Line; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ... etc ... (Of course, there have been some not so good productions - eg MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, ON THE BEACH, THORN BIRDS: THE MISSING YEARS, etc.) In general, if an Australian miniseries Come your way, be sure to see it - and double for CHANGI, an excellent masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
