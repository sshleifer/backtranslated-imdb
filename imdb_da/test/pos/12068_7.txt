This show is actually pretty good. I've read where people compare this show to getting married with children, and I assume it's a similar show for the new generation. However, due to what was expected and allowed on television in the days of Married with Children, great extremes were shown to show that it was actually a TV show and not supposed to take seriously. <br /> <br /> The war at home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. The parents talk to each other as spouse parents often do and tell their children a thing when they want to turn around and do the opposite. Of course, some of the content can be considered controversial. But I find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families out there like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a valuable lesson. It's just that the occasion is sometimes that you don't find a perfect solution to any problem a family may encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose the smallest of two evil ones. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can get is to keep your children out of real trouble and hope they learn right from wrong. I respect the authors for trying to keep the show true to life, instead of having a magical ending that the Cleaver family always had.
