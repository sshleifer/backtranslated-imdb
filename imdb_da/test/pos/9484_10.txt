After watching this DVD I became the floor. It's so wonderful. It not only captures Led Zeppelin during conventions, they span a few years. This only shows the growth of the band and the growth of their BIG music. This DVD is a must have! The DVD is over 5 hours long, with extras. The extras are also good pieces, some of the band performs in Denmark and other various promo spots. This includes recordings that were once lost, fortunately restored and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital under direct watch by Jimmy Page! Includes many timeless classics, such as Stairway To Heaven, Go to California, What is and what should never be, Moby Dick, and so many more. Large acoustic songs are also included. This will alleviate any sense that Jimmy Page is not a great guitar legend!
