I have seen the Director's Cut version and can only be content. Excellent play (especially Cole Hauser, I was sorry for the space for Claudia Black himself), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, credible plot (considering the genre) without many logical gaps, really not predictable terms, up characters. These are the biggest assets in the movie. Combined with style - some may consider this movie a B-class effort, but I would disagree with that. The whole thing is really very original and stylish. And even though I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, this hard guy fits Riddick well. Can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick, it's really cool, this flick will get a sequel ... 9/10 if you ask me
