I am a sociologist / anthropologist specializing in symbolic interactionism, and I must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context of the entire film. For anyone who has not yet seen this, I recommend that you also read "Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning" by Victor E. Frankl. I think you will be able to draw some great correlations. <br /> <br /> That is, despite the fact that the protagonists are gay, I am not a story of being gay. This is a story of finding out and finding meaning in life, in spite of the difficulties and challenges that the pain and terror stand in the way. This is a story of searching and finding balance and wholeness and happiness.
