If you are in alternative realities, considering what is genuine and what is just a fantasy, this is a thrill that enables you to guess and really make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I looked at a L.A. movie festival recently and it was by far the best in the group that I saw. It helped that it was actually about something, unlike the others being screened. It is very well aimed and the production value is top notch. I would compare it to Jacob's Ladder because it keeps you guessing what the true reality is of the world we are in. You should definitely try to chase this movie down and if it is screening at all festivals near you So try to check it out.
