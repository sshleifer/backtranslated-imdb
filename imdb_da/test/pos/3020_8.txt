The cell is weak on the plot, filled with holes and also has a bit miserable. But none of this means for director Tarsem Singh has given us one of the most visually amazing movies ever. The whole plot is just an excuse to let Tarsem fool around and take you into the mind of a serial killer that gives the audience some shocking, pleasant, breathtaking and fun blowing pictures. <br /> <br /> The pictures from This beautiful movie will keep you for a long time to come. This film is a perfect case for "suspension of disbelief" theory. Forget the stupid plot, let your senses be overwhelmed with the pictures. and J.Lo sees stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. Cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & costumes just stunning. <br /> <br /> The movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. It's just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it's the big screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The Cell is a must watch. A bold new step in film making. <br /> <br /> A captivating 8 !!
