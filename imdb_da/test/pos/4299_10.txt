Nigel Balchin's maze novel "A Way Through The Wood" has been adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also leads this "terrible British" comic book piece. It is a movie whose effect depends on the cast, depicting the varying benign / malignant characters, and this is where Fellowes' direct elections are excellent. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the movie is the metamorphosis of each player, as a single event assumes a minefield of disasters. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business objective attorney in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson) who needs more in her life: the couple are childless living in a beautiful property , assisted by their long-term "cleaner" Maggie (Linda Bassett). They participate in social excursions and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain their neighbors and oppose gruff James protest Anne continues planning: James arranges to "not attend because of business". On the party's night there is a hit and runway, where Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (she observed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William to be the offender. Anne discourages James from going to the police with the information - "How good can it do, but destroy Bill's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?". From this first 'lie' the virus spreads: James confronts Bill, who speaks James about going to the police. Anne acknowledges that she was driving Bill's Rover and is responsible, James convinces Anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation, Anne announces that she has an affair with Bill, and the three of them agree that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good. Anne eventually leaves the blame for not telling her beloved Maggie that she is the one responsible, and Maggie, even guilty of a previous theft whose life was rescued by Anne's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to her. surprising conclusion. Lies committed lies that committed lies, etc. <br /> <br /> The great effect of this intrigue is the way in which the isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Every change happens in a dramatic way. Tome Wilkinson gives the best performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expression than any actor before the audience today. Likewise, the gifted Emily Watson adds yet another great role to her repertoire, like the surprisingly dirty Rupert Everett, who, despite being another wealthy British gentleman, gives us a man who is dry in spirit and yet ultimately needy. And the always fine Linda Bassett has a small role and subtleties that make her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies. The kinematics of Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical score of Stanislas Syrewicz add immensely to the many atmospheres that history meets. This is ensemble playing at its finest, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a good understanding of the play. The interaction between these fine people makes the risky story really good. Grady Harp
