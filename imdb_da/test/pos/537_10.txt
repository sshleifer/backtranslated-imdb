Most families will recognize similarities between their own family and it created through brilliant plays by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an on-screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and a worthwhile Golden Globe Nomination. The control of her feelings is so intact that at any point in the film she can tap on them and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this movie, once again she chose a role so different from any other and carries it through with real professionalism. Any Natalie fan would have seen the movie based on her past successes, but you should also see it for the emotions released during the movie. It is a truly humble experience.
