This movie was amazing. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Okay, I know the action sucked, but that wasn't important. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed actual human emotions, whether it was Pete's anger with the blonde girl's snails or the guy who asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were awesome and the actors were very warm and it attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear gospel message. The mother and the pastor supported Ben in his new journey with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. Nicky D showed that whether or not you have the whole world to bid without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and believe it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
