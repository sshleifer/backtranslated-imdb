This 1-hour 30-minute joke is best understood by Catholics, the first religion in self-medicated comedians worldwide. It is not to say that it cannot stand on its own, as it does, that the film is not without its faults as it has. Technical issues, mostly: Believe that digital in 1998 was the answer, as it was actually in its infancy - a Beta of a Beta, if you like, and masturbation will never improve it. For God's love, Hal ... please get a red one yourself. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies of course, you like it. I liked it because I liked Grim / Fool and there were added benefits of overhaul: I couldn't help noticing a disturbing self-prophecy, a flying flight hovering overhead used as a harbinger of Armageddon in this The 1998 film. It was as if Cheney had got the whole idea from Hal. It's true - Hartley moves his players around the camera, just as it's the House of Commons, just a piece of gimmicky cry that needs a rest. After all, we are already aware of the actors and the writing is alive. Not good to write, but ... fervent. Can I use the word fervent? Intuitive, intelligent, not discouraging. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love PJ Harvey in this course, I will love her anywhere. Strangely, if Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she should look up Harvey and bring a bottle of blonde.
