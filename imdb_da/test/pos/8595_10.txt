This movie is the best movie I've seen for a long time. It is also the best movie set that uses a drama to tell history without speculating as with JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. It clearly depicts the links that Belgium had in the Congo. It is also easy for us the European and American forces behind the power of the Congo today. The film was sure to specifically imply the United States, rightly in the murder of Lumumba. This film could never be made in the United States for American film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) It also lets us in on the problems that were present with Congo's internal conflict, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how uncertain countries are in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization, and those who were the colonists continue to pull the strings of power and power. The film is brilliantly shot with Eriq Ebouaney, an excellent Lumumba. The molding is great and they really pull you into the feeling of the climate in the Congo during that time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must see for those who love drama with a proper historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
