The Italian job requires daylight and no experience is needed. This is a good matinee and a good afternoon in the cinema. The reason is good, but the actual player out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. These are car gates, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the bad guy" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, he seems to be happy to portray the exact same characters as in his previous movie "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at cheap prices then you need the Italian job.
