I liked this movie a lot, but the feeling that I mostly got away was reminiscent of how much I had enjoyed the novel. The film has two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is great here and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can with the thin-drawn character she gets - as well as a surprisingly outstanding Michelle Pfeiffer and a stable Jason Robards. The adaptation is basically true to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The movie does not really dazzle except for some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job to visualize this wonderful tragic story. With regard to films adapted to novels, it certainly went among the better. If nothing else, it has sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover the favorite passages of Jane Smily's excellent novel and return to King Lear to refine the lowercase letters to see just how deep the parallels are. Worth your time as a movie, definitely and hopefully enough to make you remember reading great literature is also a joy.
