'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of docudrama at his very best. Well written, well acted by actors who carry a credible resemblance to their historical characters, very informative and very entertaining. The set designs and costumes notice the United States in World War II, and plotting and dialogue make the viewer feel as though he was really present in Los Alamos and caught up in the Manhattan Project's excitement. The only drawback is that this is a British production, and some of the players lack the skills to influence a compelling American accent. (The current day is Australian and Irish actors who record non-native dialects, amazing.) The story is entirely in line with Richard Rhodes' final story of the atomic bomb's evolution. Unfortunately, the miniseries were only shown a few times at PBS in the early 1980s and apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> 'Oppenheimer' compares favorably with the newer 'Fat Man & Little' Boy's feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely General would be thoroughly flattered) and Dwight Schultz ( alumnus of TV's 'A-Team') as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about 4x as long as the Newman feature, but spends the entire extra time to its advantage.
