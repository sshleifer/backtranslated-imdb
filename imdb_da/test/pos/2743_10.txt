This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, which is brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Oscar. Particular mention is made of the fantastic music score and sound effects, which are an integral element to make this such a memorable and fun cartoon. In fact, later episodes in the series (of which there were four in total) were not based on original Dr Seuss material, although all of the latter continued to use its well-known rhyming style. The three successors were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); How now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr Magoo.
