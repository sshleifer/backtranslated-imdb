A really good movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. Lots of swords. Huge battle scenes. Heros and villains. Real story. <br /> <br /> Few in the West know much Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is actually named after him. Some are familiar with the Terracotta Army recently excavated. This is a historical epic of how he completed the period of connected states and united China. He founded a 14-year dynasty, but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty, which has permanently defined the Chinese civilization ever since. <br /> <br /> Chin (or King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire) was about the same time with Scipio, Hannibal and Fabius in the West. The parallel Roman world domination (Western and Eastern worlds) was achieved without a single high-hard personality like Chin. It would not be another century before the West produced Caesar - the closest comparable western figure. Chin is very sympathetic at first, but he develops into a ruthless despot during the film. The story only records the ruthless despot part, but the sympathetic beginning provides space for true character development during this long film. The famous story of the encounter with the murder is as true as any two thousand-year-old anecdote can be. Gong Li is lovely. She is the emotional core of the story. It all makes it great movie making.
