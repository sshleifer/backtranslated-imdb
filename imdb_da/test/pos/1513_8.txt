"Un Gatto nel Cervello" / "Cat in the Brain" is one of the goriest horror films ever made. There are lots of blood and gore, including chain saw slaughterhouses, bloody stabbings and many layoffs. The movie is also interesting as "self parody" by Fulci, but doing and violence is the key element in it. Some of the Gore FX were taken from their own Fulcis movie "Quando Alice Ruppe Lo Specchio" and "In Fantasmi di Sodoma" (both 1988) plus Gore FX taken by Fulci-watched "The Snake House" aka "Bloody Psycho" by Leandro Lucchetti, "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi, "Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta" by Mario Bianchi, "Non Si Sevizia in Bambini" by Giovanni Simonelli and "Luna di Sangue" aka "Fuga dalla Morte" by Enzo Milioni (throughout 1989). When Brett Halsey strikes the woman's face for pulp, is from "Quando Alice Ruppe Lo Specchio", a movie Fulci had made for Italian television in 1988. The chain saw's chain sawing at the beginning was taken from the same movie, like the head of the microwave oven and the guy tha T gets run again and again. Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema!
