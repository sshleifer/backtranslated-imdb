We don't know why this extraordinary movie was never made available officially on DVD ... Anthony Quinn's performance alone makes this a must-see. There are relatively few films where an actor identifies himself so deeply with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, filmmakers. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful portrayal of an innocent Romanian, literally pulled out of his house and everyday life of forces that he cannot understand, is only part of what makes this movie great. The scripture is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled the Communist takeover of his country, and the film succeeds deeply into a well-known area of ​​eastern European history. Told as a series of Kafka-esquire fate in fate, Johann Morit's misadventures (told openly and honestly without any of the political correctness currently so valuable in Hollywood) are actually a praise for the lost innocence of Romanian people. . It is diabolically ironic that this eulogy is signed by a French director working with the American money from an Italian producer and overseeing a multinational cast front of an extraordinary Mexican-born thespian. <br /> <br /> I have seen the mention of VCDs of this movie in various Asian internet stores, and I was fortunate to have a digital recording of this movie broadcast on the UK version of TCM. But it's a shame that "The 25th Hour" isn't anywhere on the future DVD release map of MGM studios.
