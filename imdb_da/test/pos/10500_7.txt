Thanks The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at. 1. I really enjoyed it. To be honest I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore and of course the talented Chloe Nicholle (like Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really poor mainly due to the low budget, but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography shows it as a hard core movie. There is absolutely no effort in lightning. But let's ignore the fact because let's be honest, we looked at "Pleasures of Sin" because of the large amounts of sex. The gender factor is quite good and offers steaming and explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle delivers the best practice of the female cast. <br /> <br /> So my advice is to watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for sex scenes; Don't expect anything else.
