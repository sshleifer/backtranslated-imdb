First of all, nothing will ever be compared to the original movie, but for goshakes, they do not try. It's just a person's opinion of what might have happened when Rhett left Scarlett at Tara. I thought it was a great movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The landscape alone would make me see the movie. Just watch this movie as an extension of the original, and don't think they're trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable, and you'll enjoy it a lot. They really caught Scarlett's spoiled selfishness in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the look of Rhett that he is clearly in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus, although some of them are only seen on television. I always wanted them to have other kids after Bonnie Blue died in the movie, and it met my needs perfectly. <br /> <br /> Lore60
