Even a decade after "Frontline" was posted on ABC, it is as good as possible that "current affairs" programs still use the same tricks over and over again. Occasionally, "today tonight" and "a current affair" are seen hiding behind journalistic professionalism, yet they feed us nothing but tired stories of weight loss and risky traders, shameless networking campaigns, and pointless celebrity pieces. After being subject to this entertainment-free idle between 'The Simpsons' at 18:00 and 'Sale of the Century' (or 'Temptation') at. At 7pm I was too attentive to the little tricks that these shows would use to attract reviews. <br /> <br /> fortunately four rising comedians ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner ?? was also overly aware of all this and they designed their frustrations for one of the most viciously fun media satiries you will ever watch on TV. The four entertainers had already met comedy success, their former most memorable TV stint was on The Late Show, the brilliant Saturday night show that ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and also played comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin, Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" boasts an ensemble of colorful characters, each with its own distinctive and splendid personality. Currently the show is led by nicely groomed Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious, dim-witted narcissist. Mike works under the delusion that the show serves a vital role for society ?? He is always thrilled that they "maintain their journalistic integrity"? And his executive producers have excelled in making him believe just that. Mike is basically a doll to bring the news to the people; Occasionally he gets the blow that he is led along the nose, but usually this thought is stamped out through appeals to his vanity or promises of promotion. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is a senior female reporter on the show. She is constantly worried about her appearance and public profile, and if the smokers are to be believed, she has had a romantic connection with almost any male celebrity that exists. Another equal amoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is portrayed by Tiriel Mora, who memorably played inept solicitor Dennis Denuto in the Australian comedy classic 'The Castle'. Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is Line Producer on the show and the single shining lighthouse on the morale of "Frontline" set. Then there is the very entertaining wild champion, Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff lives on the fact that he always agrees with Mike's opinion and laughs laughably at his jokes before admitting he doesn't get them. <br /> <br /> For each of the three shows, we are treated to a different EP, Executive Producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately died in 1995, runs the program in season 1. He has a decent set of morals and is always bourgeois for his staff, yet it is more than willing to throw them aside in favor of high ratings . Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives at Season 2, a hard-wearing, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to tie Mike together; The last episode of the second season, when Mike finally gets better of him, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for the third season, is raw, uncomfortable and extremely sexist. It is therefore noteworthy that you will eventually look like him. <br /> <br /> With its casting of distinctive, exaggerated figures, "Frontline" has many fun satirical topical programs and their dubious methods of winning ratings. Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, and often implemented many plot ideas from the latest real-life situations, but this does not detract from the reality of the show's timeliness for ten years. Celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Look out for Harry Shearer's hilarious look in the Season 2 episode "Changing the Face of Current Affairs", playing Larry Hadges, an American network employee to reform the show. <br /> <br /> Especially in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humor, uncharacteristic of such a merciless comedy show. Really funny moments are born from Brooke, who were surreptitious transformed into having an abortion, murdered by a gallic gun and Mike treacherously betrays his best friend's hopes and dreams, only to be told he is a good friend. The last minute of the series ?? minus an added scene under the credits, which was probably added just if a fourth season was to be produced ?? was probably the biggest, hardest ending to a comedy series that I have seen yet. Below is a very preliminary list of my top five favorite "Frontline" episodes, but this is not a mistake every time single half-hour is absolutely fun and hard-hitting satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The Siege" (Season 1) <br /> <br /> 2) "Give them Rope" (Season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) "Addicted to Fame "(Season 3) <br /> <br /> 4)" Basic Instincts "(Season 2) <br /> <br /> 5)" Add Sex and Tubes "(Season 1)
