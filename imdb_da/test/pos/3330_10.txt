This animated card is a remake of one of Tex Avery's former shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). A fugitive convicted (here known as Joe), who has just knocked out Alka Fizz Prison, is trying to step one step ahead of Droopy (known as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but always manages to run into him in a way or another. This is easily one of the most fragmented, fun shorts that rolled out of the M-G-M animation study. It manages to get most of it laughing from the shocked reactions Joe has when he meets McPoodle (including some equally distorted sound effects, ie horns, screams, elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M short, boring, kinetic pacing can be expected (along with some great, surrealistic synagogues - that is, you're trying to run away from McPoodle and actually run from the side of the movie). Pop this one into your DVD player and laugh yourself silly.
