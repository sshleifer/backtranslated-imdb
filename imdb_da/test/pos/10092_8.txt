The idea is not original ... If you have seen such a kind of story before, you would know what the end would come out after having seen in the first twenty minutes ... the script, the players' positioning and the screening are also obvious ... If you haven't seen such a story before, it's definitely a good experience to enjoy the twist in the end ... don't forget to see it again when you know the "truth," you'll even enjoy the plots ... Even though I have a real guess at the beginning, I still couldn't help holding onto my seat to the end ... Conclusion: A must see! ! This one from Korea is better than any newer movie from the genre from Japan ... forget Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Don't miss it !!
