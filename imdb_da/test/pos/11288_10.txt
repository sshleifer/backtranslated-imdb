I want to preface this review by saying that I have no idea what the "begotten" really is about. All I really know is that in the beginning God kills himself, again giving birth to Mother Earth, which continues to impregnate with the seed of God. She is then born a son. The rest is rather subjective and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to interpret the movie was this; God killed himself drawing the start of the scientific revolution when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, like the geocentric view of the universe, etc. Mother Earth symbolized people who began to think for themselves and reject the church's "it happens such because God says such "views. The tribal people were the church that repelled them and tried to force Christianity into their throats. I'm not quite sure how Son of Earth fits in all this. Mother Earth and Tribal people seemed to fight over him, so perhaps he represents freedom for people or something from them. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the last parts of this movie should mean. Coincidence, rape and then the degradation of Mother Earth and the Earth's Son and grinding them into the ground as a mortar and pestle can mean anything, but this is where the fun of this movie lies; You can interpret it as you like. There doesn't have to be a definite significance for what you can let your eye wander. Sometimes you do not even know what to look at because it is shot at a strange angle or it is too cloudy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was that I was expecting a really scary movie. I went in and wondered that I should call immediately after a warning "seven days" warning. What I got was pleasantly different. It was not scary at all, but it touched my imagination. Trying to decipher the movie's cryptic message was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were actually beautiful. Mother Earth right after she was born and the last shot of the forest trail comes to mind. <br /> <br /> So generally, I should say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's certainly the most abstract movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad thing.
