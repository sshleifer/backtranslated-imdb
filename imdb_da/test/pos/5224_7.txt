If we are considering three movies with a similar topic made in 1930, 'The Covered Wagon' was made in 1923 and 'Wagon Master' made in 1950, the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'The Covered Wagon' is only 7 years, while the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'Wagon Master' is 20 years. It's great because it shows how much film evolved in the 7 years, and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come. 'The Big Trail is technically close to the' Wagon Master 'but age apart from' The Covered Wagon '. The story is about the pioneers going from Missouri to West Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who carries the caravan, he is a coarse and medieval guy. John Wayne is the good guy, and the movie makes too much of a point of his great looks, and doesn't give him a chance to be Wayne as we are used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why Wayne just forgets her. Raoul Walsh was a champion of showing caravans and cattle moving through the west, he instructed 'The Tall Men' in 1955, which has much in common with 'The Big Trail'.
