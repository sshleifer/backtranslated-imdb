If you like your movies to pull your feelings out of you, if you like your movies with a guy, you can root for and relate to if you like your black and white movies, see this movie! See it from start to finish because you won't miss a battle. It is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something happens, so when the plot begins to unfold, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this movie, as our family had some of the same things going on in what the movie does. We loved Frankie, who plays the lead convincingly. What ever you think of Frank Sinatra, put it aside, in the movie he's skinny, and he doesn't sing, so keep an open mind. For the era it was made in, it tells a story that is still being told today in homes across the nation and possibly the world. Please see if you like older movies, give this a try.
