In the tradition of "neo" film noir flicks such as "Chinatown", this film focuses on a criminal's mystery in a gloomy kingdom with a bit of insight into the mingles in. The typical noir characters, in addition, including the policeman to prove himself, girl in distress and a bad, bad guy. Sharky's Machine gets a 9 out of 10 for his movie first, plus his direction, story, strong character plays and excellent jazz score. Available on DVD, although the audio track itself is out of print (but available "used" at some auction sites). Filmed on the spot in beautiful downtown Atlanta (Romanesque author Diehl's hometown) and the tidy, around 1979 appearance of the city would make an ancient Atlanta citizen or visitor long after the old days before twelve-lane interstates crossed the city, a cinematographer's dream of that time. This was Rachel Ward's first US feature film.
