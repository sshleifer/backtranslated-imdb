The cast alone tells you that this will be a notch above the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy teamed up with Alex Cord, who at that time seemed to be on the star. The result is a movie that is both off-beat and down-beat, and yet it will satisfy those seeking more from a Western than just a gunplay. Particularly interesting here is the character of Alex Cord. It is expected that the "deer" in these Westerns will be tacit and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example, and surprisingly, he has often shone in a passive, even weak position. Much has been done by the fact that he fears falling into the epileptic passages that immobilized his father, and in those moments of helplessness he is either beneficial to those who want to harm him or those who want to help him. To emphasize his inaction, Clay McCord - don't you love that name? - The skin is often removed to the waist as if it were a little more than an attractive toy that was exhibited. There is even a strong masochistic touch in nature, most proven when used as a punch bag of his enemies and then suspended by his wrist and left hanging over the middle of a street. Not only does he fail to protect himself, but McCord is just as ineffective in protecting them around him. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. <br /> <br /> While "one minute of praying, another to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone that separates it from one another and makes it persist getting stuck in memory. It is also a great showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tends to fall after this point after a couple of promising years in the mid-1960s. He must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this - in his physical prime - and his scene is stuck at his wrist, harsh and sweaty, is a memorable piece of cinematic "beefcake".
