It's really too bad that no one knows about this movie. I think if it was just spruced up a bit and if it wasn't that low budget, I think one of the big movie companies might have wanted it. I first saw this movie when I was 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the many great but illegal lengths that Mitchell goes to just to keep his family together. So it inspired me, and it surprises me now. If you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
