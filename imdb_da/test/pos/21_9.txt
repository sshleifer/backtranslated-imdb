"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliant acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this little movie attracted enough attention to get five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it is nice to know that the Academy can be guilty of a good tasting every time (of course, they gave the award that year to the "Terms of Endearment" - they will not be accused of showing too much taste). Albert Finney is a drunk Shakespeare actor in a production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is the man who works twice behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It is both fun and passionate to see the Courtenay s shadow Finney is with attention and devotion, to see only his efforts completely dissatisfied and dismissed, even up to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders together, and although Finney gets the most flashy moments (he gets to recite Shakespeare), the Courtenay is the heart and soul of the movie. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
