What I find remarkable about this amazing movie is that Altman, the crazy and wild guy he is, took the novel THE COLD DAY IN THE PARK, and the Sandy Dennis character was originally a man in the book. He was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted hustler. It's strange that Altman fans are unaware of how clever he was to change the main character's gender; This avoids the gay erotic taboos of homosexual life in the 60s and makes Dennis' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition. If you see the movie again, it will be clear how hard Altman's mind works ...
