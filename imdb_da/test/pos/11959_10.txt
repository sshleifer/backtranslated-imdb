What can I say about this movie, except it's fun! John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a new high school graduate who has two choices, learns to take up the family business with street welding or spend the summer at Nantucket with his friend George Calamari (played fun by Joel Murray) and his friends. <br /> <br /> When I say Zany, believe me, it can't be much zanier than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw a little girl named Squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by Demi Moore and you have it to split your pages, laughing movies. <br /> <br /> The race runs freely in this movie and the story line, although the typical good versus bad and good conquests, is amazing with a regatta twist like showdown. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes lots of laughs and a good mood. If you like to thoroughly * enjoy * your movies, then you can't miss One Crazy Summer!
