Take a young liberal idealist Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) in a top-ranking classification in a state front business because of his father's position and join him with a drug deal, Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. Sean Penn played part of the punk drug dealer with a particular song froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types. Gall Penn carries with him in every situation is unique; He even suggests the Soviets who run drugs for him. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie over and over and every time I see something new. It seems to me that a major problem with US spyware is its inbreeding, which leads to the recruitment of a manifestly unsuitable candidate due to temperament and propensity to a state front office. <br /> <br /> I remember when Falconeer fled the prison and led the authorities on a wild goose hunt. I see that despite the escape, he is now released. It is a pity that the Soviets are no longer able to accept the misery! And Cheery Cherio!
