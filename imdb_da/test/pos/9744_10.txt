Probably the finest series ever made (no argument here so far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and beautiful Dale Arden, traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spell binding, spectacular and action-packed chapters, Flash and his friends, along with new found friends like Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the amazing King Vultan, pace their resources together to fight the evil and armies of the merciless Ming of mongo and the jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now she is a car!). This series is not just a slice of most series in the form of plot, acting and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many earlier sets on its sometime as the lab from The Bride of Frankenstein and Opera House from Opera Phantom to name but a few. The production values ​​across the board have progressed in my most humble opinion for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are truly creative and top-notch. We get hawk men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigrons (oh my!) And many, many other amazing things. Are all of them trustworthy and first-class special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is great and the chapter's beginnings are well-written, long enough to revive the viewer's memories from the previous chapter and scored the expert. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job with everything wonderful and creates a worthy movie for Alex Raymond's phenom cartoon. Finally, the play is pretty good in this series. Too often, the series also have no names without talents around one or two previous talents - most of them all have some ability. Don't make me mistake, this is not a Shakespeare troupe in any way, but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike, comfortable job like Flash. He is well helped by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the casting generally with two artists standing out. But before I get to the two, let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been great for this series to come to the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. Shorts Crabbe (and unfortunately for us all Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) bear is about as form-fit a pair of shorts boys can wear. The girls have been wearing mid-running all over and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited action talent but she Lawson is also very hungry and sensual and beautiful, but for me, the two actors who produce the serial number Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, relentless and fun. Middleton is a classroom. "Little" Lipson plays King Vultan: Boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol of pure joy in life and all the essence of hedonism Lipson steals every scene he is in. The plot winds here and there - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera and The foundation for lots of science fiction to follow.
