Warning - this movie has some amazing graphics and should never be seen by the kids. <br /> <br /> The artist this story is about was actually a fine Korean painter who rose from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, this guy was in many ways also a smoke in many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament, and what might have been annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But at other times he was simply a drunk man - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Most recently in the film, his appear to be annoying, abrasive and unnecessarily cruel to have diminished. While all this did not make him a particularly good man, it is important to catch on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artist's actual works were shown throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show it to my students (I teach a school of art), but can't because there is just too much adult material. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially younger ones) is when he .... hmmm ... I don't think IMDb will even let me describe what happened, but it was very graphic and involves body fluids. Not only a scary and disgusting scene that didn't have to be seen, but a reason to keep the junior from watching this otherwise wonderful movie. It's a shame.
