Take a subject I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? It then happens that back around 1979, director Robert Altman said he did not think he had ever made a real movie and that he expected one of those kids who ran skateboards - if he did not break his neck - would do the first movie. Well, I wouldn't put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta, but he's a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the movie he made to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archive film existed. Peralta edited it well with non-common speaking main images of his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but it has been done. Altman's prediction is not entirely true. However, what Peralta has done is probably getting enough of the energy of the daring days that we can appreciate what it might have been when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. This is all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown."
