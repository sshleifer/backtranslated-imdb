The second live action excursion to Asterix is ​​far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories called the first movie, instead staying close to the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Queen Cleopatra has made a message with the emperor to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. Royal Architect Edifis seeks help from Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix to complete his task. There are more laughs, some jokes that only the French can get (jibes in the 35 hour week) while others are more universal. The big budget special effects are spectacular, but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic book. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work brilliantly as a couple, while Monica Bellucci makes perfect casting as Cleopatra. Also for the fans of the comics, the funny pirates see a look out for their absence in movies 1.
