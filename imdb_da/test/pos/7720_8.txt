This movie is about a young Indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself engaged to a woman. The problem is he is gay. To stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, a lie leads to another until it germinates without control. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun and made me laugh many times. Sally Banks' play is amazing and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The reason is also excellent. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being scared, worried and sad. On the other hand, Jimi's girlfriend, Jack, gets much less attention in the movie. I would have liked him to get more lines in the film and have more character development. But as I think the director wants to make this a more ordinary movie, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the movie. It's great to watch a gay affirmative movie. Moreover, this film preaches us to accept the difference of other people, be it sexuality, culture and lifestyle. This movie makes the viewers think hard. <br /> <br /> We need movies like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this movie!
