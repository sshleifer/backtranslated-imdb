I am a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His film often deals with people who are trying to overcome their weaknesses. It is obsessive love in 'Gloss in the grass, poverty in' A tree growing in Brooklyn 'or racism in' Gentlemen's Agreement. ' While looking for other movies made by Kazan, I stumbled upon a movie based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The film is called "Focus" stars William H.Macy (who happens to be one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It is about anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job until it affects him personally. That's the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong, and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because he was now considered an outsider, and he began to experience the same look the same remarks, and the same brutal that Mr. Fine stone (David Pamyers) experienced. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well-acted. Meat Loaf does a great job of playing a dirt bag! Both Macy's and Dern's performances are excellent! It is easier in life to go along with, rather than go against. Sometimes for people to take a stand, things have to affect their lives or their beloved life ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
