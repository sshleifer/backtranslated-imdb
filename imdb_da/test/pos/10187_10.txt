It's not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> Not the usual eye shadow I thought it would be. Too many things happen immediately, your senses can hardly do it. A product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), The Disney characters are in it (And you're going to be part of their world), it's fun, it's magical, it's exciting - I know this sounds like an ad - but it's really so amazing! Turns Christmas into bringing the baby in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone already makes Disney worth it. ;)
