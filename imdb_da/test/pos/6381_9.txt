this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. It's about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he does not love her back and he is a middle-aged bitch. He begins to love her after some really smashed things happen on their honeymoon, I will not give it away. it is odd yes !! but differently than other movies in a good way I think. I don't know what to compare to, but it's a love story. but also has many fun things. like seeing James Franco in a wig. I liked the notebook a lot and it felt fine because of the love story. but the rest is different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I watched this movie on a test screener because I like her a lot and her fashion. I liked her in the factory girl, but it's a better movie than it was. her and james franco really look in love with this movie and i hope they are together in real life but dont know it <br /> <br /> see it !!!!
