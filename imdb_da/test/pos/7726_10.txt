Even for the non-opera loving public, the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by the Bizet of a gypsy girl whose capricious lover destroys men. But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass, created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845, has never been told as well as in this film version of the highly gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda (' Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love ',' Amantes', 'If they tell you, I fell' etc.). Involving the author of the novel as the protagonist seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - José - just gives the right view of the story of this famous gypsy who will be told. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the incredibly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory next to the military station where the real José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. Carmen is stormy and, in a fight initiated by a colleague manufacturer, notices that Carmen is a gypsy, kills the Carmen colleague and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the successful Carmen, and when Carmen flirts with him, he accepts to let her escape. His repayment is a promise of a passion with Carmen. Carmen is holding her covenant, giving José his first sexual encounter, and José is convicted. His lack of military discipline results in him losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but by his release, José Carmen meets again, kills a co-officer, and in fear runs out to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies who are Carmens people. Many events seem to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, takes over devastating behavior, behavior is what encompasses Carm's dismay and affair with a bullfight, and the passion for Carmen and José comes to a tragic end. <br /> <br /> One factor that makes history (as adapted to the screen shot of director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà) is moving so well is the role that Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict) plays: his question of José completes the story of that Bizet opera-only outlines. The action is amazing, the cinematography, Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score of José Nieto contribute tremendously to the success of this very fine film. This is a must for lovers of opera Carmen and a great drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
