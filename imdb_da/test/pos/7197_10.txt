I've read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least five times, and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I was expecting a lot from this movie .... and I was finally happy. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre Cesar), which was not a real success in addition to the look of Laetitia Casta, it really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first movie, the instructor tried to be too realistic about the time when the story is set, and it killed the whole spirit that made Asterix fun. In this is all the clothes, the speakers and the same thing as Goscinny and Uderzo's work ... more, it really sticks to the original story with the disadvantage that we know pretty much everything that will happen, but Alain Chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and every time the first sign of boredom starts to appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all kinds of humor I really like, and although it may be mixed too much, I can do nothing but suffer. So, if you like the Asterix and the humor of all those young talents who started in "Nulle Party Ailleurs" (a French mix of the tonight show and SNL) go watch this movie.
