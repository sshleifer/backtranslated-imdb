This show is great for many reasons. The father and mother can communicate with their children today at age. It is so wonderful to see a true family rather than some indulged overactive family. I saw this time and was hooked.It looked good to see a black family on TV worth seeing. This show was too late, but on the way out it was treated with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. The best thing about the show was that it was about it in a really humorous way. Great show for the family. I can't tell you how many times I've set up, saw this show late at night and laugh my head away. Great pg 13 rated show.I loved everybit of this show.
