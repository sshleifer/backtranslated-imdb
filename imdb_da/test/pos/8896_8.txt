As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings quite good, and a big step over previous attempts to animate everyone's favorite Gaul. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is not familiar with the famous comic book series, the show will be difficult to follow, but for us it is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is much better than previous comic adaptations. You can tell that they took time and effort to resume the look and feel of the series this time. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie, and I can see how fans of these titles may feel confused or slightly let down, but I was so caught up in seeing one of them My favorite childhood cartoons were faithfully represented on the screen. Any nausea I had was less compared. Smaller spoiler follows ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief who has been caught by the Vikings. The Vikings believe that by the boy teaching them about fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly formulated advice from their druid city. Along the way, the boy meets the Viking manager's daughter Abba, and they fall in love, etc. Etc. .. If my explanation sounds coincident, then calm. It's easy to follow the plot! Absolutely a good buy .. You can buy this DVD via Amazon France, but be warned. Your DVD player will probably not be able to play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to see it.
