So well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also an entertaining story that brings a smile to your face with every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual guy. Each figure seemed to fit their part into a tee. It's the best performance I've seen from Mrs Capshaw - she's been in more movies than I thought, but it was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you, giving a great budget and all the best that money can buy technically. Two of the players have successful T.V. shows of their own now - it's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good work.
