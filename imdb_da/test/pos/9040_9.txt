It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 when Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand of black and white issues at that time. The movie deserves strong kudos to take this stand, to have outstanding action from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super-intelligent script that does not offend the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast maturity, it does a great job! Juano Hernandez (an extraordinary actor who has played roles in many film films) is a proud black man accused of murdering a white man in the south. The audience could really worry less about the details - they are just hell-bent on hanging. And in spite of his commitment to the law, one lawyer in the city who has agreed to defend him is also assumed to be guilty and not really want to know the truth - just delay it until they can try to judge him and then have a legally hanging one! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins to explore the truth. At this time, the best character is introduced in this amazing drama - played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later played Mrs Trumbull on I love LUCY). She steals the single-handed show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and the will to stand up for the black man. At a wonderful point in the movie, a mob tries to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she is very stuck and forces them to lie down. There is much more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but I give it to you to see it for yourself. See it with your children if you have a chance - it opens up a great dialogue about how far race conditions have come in the last 50 years. By the way, apparently 1949 a good year for Hollywood finally addresses race prejudices head on, as Twentieth Century Fox also released "Pinky" - an equally effective and powerful movie about racism, interracial wedding and even rape! See both movies if you can.
