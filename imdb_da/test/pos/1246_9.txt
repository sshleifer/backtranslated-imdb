I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, that was disrespectful in the movie, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that there is more value in recognizing others, and his disrespectful respect must be changed. This film was a refreshing change from the trash bin that Hollywood is trying to push into our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really think this was one of Disney's best, though a few things could have been left out. I was impressed by the lack of gang and lack of sexual inuendos. It's not perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.
