Bringing back the A team was an hour long special screened on Channel 4 in the UK last year and hosted presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins, the show was trying to track and reunite the participating A-Team members for the first time ever on TV. This has been something that has never been tried by anyone before. Well, not by anyone I know it is. Justin makes a great present, and his eccentric personality and humorous lusts shone throughout this program. The attempts he made to grab the cast members are ever so much fun, but he too was very persistent and eager to accomplish this task, which is a credit for him. Remind yourself, he's still great on television - either by presenting a show like this or the Friday night project with his co-host Alan Carr. There were appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultzkaka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging aka General 'Bull' Full Bright, creator of the A team, Stephen J Cannell and the great man himself, Mr T aka BA Baracus. They were just fascinating to see and hear what they had to say about the program that became a global hit during the 80s as they remind and relive the good and bad moments of the show: both under and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, no one is George Peppard, but of course he is already in heaven, understandably and oddly enough, no Melinda who played Amy. I just didn't understand why she wasn't on the show. Okay, she became the ax after 3 seasons or anything, but she was the first and original female member of A-Team-only to be replaced Marla's Tawnia and so it would have been great to see and hear her side to A- Team history, in addition to the other cast members. All in all, Bring Back The A-Team was a great documentary of show. Perhaps this could have been spread more by means of which this could have been a six-part documentary. But it was a great effort from JLC. recommended
