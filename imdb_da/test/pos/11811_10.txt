It was such a beautiful movie. Such a great achievement from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and executed. One must see !! I cried my eyes almost throughout the film. This is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to look at, it teaches us all a very important lesson in life, and how we should approach the hard subject of AIDS, how we should teach our children to cope it and the people around them. Not only with AIDS but with any terminal disease. I hadn't even heard of this movie before I rolled through t.v. One day and happen to run over it. I recommend everyone to see this, just don't forget your box of tissues. Several films should be made like this. Extremely heartwarming.
