I expected FAME to be an uplifting movie, but it ended the opposite. The overall plot that follows the lives of several permanent students participating in a performing arts school has great potential. However, FAME builds his characters up beautifully and leaves us so many questions when it is over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene appeared - we thought the DVD had skipped or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and almost none of them are resolved when the movie ends! You may think there are too many characters, but that's enough for many scenes. It is clear that the film was cut and shortened because it sometimes lacks transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really relate to her character's ambition and follow her heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypically poor student who cannot read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't particularly like Irene Cara's character of Coco, but it's not Cara's fault, since her script is weak and her character is not rude. Her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs guarantee to watch the whole movie. In summary, the film can use many improvements, but the quality actors and the great music make their place in film history.
