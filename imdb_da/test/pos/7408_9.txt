It is characteristic that this film is not better known. Of course, it lacks most elements that a successful theater film needs: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic love interest .. <br /> <br /> Everything is topsy-turvy here, nothing works as it should, everyone is clumsy, sad, angry, hurt and hungry, and no one has any solution to anything. In short: it's war, and it's hell for everyone involved. People try to do the best, but interests, crimes and so-called customs mixing. The image transports us back in time to the civil war with an intensity rarely seen in today's cinema. Fairly honest images of intense beauty. The actors are very well thrown to the story, and they make the characters live alive in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a pile of nickel!
