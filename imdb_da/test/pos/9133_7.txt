Gradually, I got hold of this "masterpiece", it seems to me that it must have seemed terribly wise in his time. It is French, arty, under-play to the point of pain, and ultimately downbeat. But from the perspective of 37 years in the future, it is also just a little vacuum, pretentious and unsatisfactory. Others have summed up the story, but I don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic error at the core of this movie: the main characters Corey and Vogel really don't deserve what they get. They play square within their code, never hurt anyone who doesn't ask for it and show great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey is in particular the victim of his former gangster who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to get him killed, apparently just because he (Corey) dared to "borrow" a few thousand francs. It is here that should be guilty of a break! Instead, things go much worse for them than they really need within the logic of history. One can argue that this is the whole point: the real villains are never caught; that they gather with the police as needed, sell their friends and always come out on top. But it is not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend does not appear with the police. He also did not appear disgraceful over his victory. In fact, having materialized several times when he needs it, he is nothing to see at the end, leaving a dramatic excitement (his coward with Corey) completely unresolved! <br /> <br /> However, I would like to say that this movie is well worth seeing for its beautiful photograph, its slow, conscious pacing, its stunning deadpan performances, its elaborate hoist sequence and its art film style enclosure in the late 1960s.
