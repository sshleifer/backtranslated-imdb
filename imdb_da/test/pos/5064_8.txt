Is torture ever real? No The answer is simple and absolutely without any qualifications. The reason why this movie showed is the effect torture has on a society. The values ​​that have been fiercely fought in Western society for centuries of revolution and struggle are for ALL men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and with respect for their essential rights as human beings. In order to protect this society, the institutions have been developed to handle misdemeanors openly, fairly and honestly. These institutions have been adapted and passed through generations of hard work. One can argue that these are the true cornerstone of democracy as they belong to all of us, allowing us all to be heard. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman acts to be committed in our name if we divide our societies into those who have rights and those who do not, we regret the work of our ancestors. Moreover, we are all accomplices and all guilty and contaminated. Whether those we accuse or not are irrelevant. We are defined by our attitudes and responses.
