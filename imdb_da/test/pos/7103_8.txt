House of Dracula was made at the end of Universal's horror cycle from the 1940s and I have seen this a few times. <br /> <br /> A crazy doctor, Edelman breeds plants for a serum that heals people. Count Dracula comes to a cure for his vampireism, and Lawrence Talbot will then see if he can cure him from becoming a full-moon werewolf. Frankenstein's monster is then discovered, and Edelman brings him back to life, just as the villagers come down to the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now cured, and one of Edelman's female assistants is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving. <br /> <br /> Support includes Universal Horror controllers Lon Chaney Jr. (The Wolf Man), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Also starring Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> House of Dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there. Fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
