I saw this movie many years ago, have tried to locate it, but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. It was so esoteric, yet one of a handful of movies that stays with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, as the principle of uncertainty, the duck is the crucial thing. Acting is amazing, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of vanity, a general melancholy permeates, and yet it's hard not to be absorbed in history. I rented it and thought it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but it's clearly not. Or horror, or even excitement. In fact, you feel a grateful director took the courage to make a movie like this, for which there is of course not a solid audience. I know that some people have complained about Klaus Kinski's brief role, but I think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery in this movie.
