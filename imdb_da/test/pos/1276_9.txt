Chris Nolan's maze as noir about voyeurism and identity is fantastic from start to finish. A first movie is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", but perhaps a little harder to get a handle on. Still, it beats originality and creative drive, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. Few filmmakers have made use of their editors and attention to the story that Nolan has. The story is about a boring writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until he follows a person who has noticed him after others, and has followed him in the cubes from which the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but just as razor-sharp.
