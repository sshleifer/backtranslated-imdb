I don't like boxing, don't understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive portraits of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. The reason actually showed stable, loving families. The fighting sequences are violent, like boxing, but not as over the top as rocky movies. Nothing wrong with trying known themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rental.
