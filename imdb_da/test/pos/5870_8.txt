This is a thought-provoking film that binds the inequalities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, haves and have-nots. Robert Shaw does an honorable job in his role as the obligatory, correct driver, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) initially overcome her mental depression. However, Steven has many mixed feelings about this lady in the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which, of course, exceeds the social boundaries that separate them. <br /> <br /> I haven't read anything before this and only judges the movie that I've seen it. I consider it a very honest story about the reality of daily life and the conflict about what we might want or expect from life and what we get. It's a nice drama worth seeing again.
