I watched this movie at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I worked in the wine industry, I had been very eager to see this documentary and I was not disappointed. Reported retrieved from over 500 hours of recording, the good news is that Nossiter not only releases a theatrical score, but a ten-ten-hour series of movie on DVD at next Christmas (ThinkFilm distributes it). The bad news is that it is still a bit of an unpleasant animal. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long. To Toronto he is cut about half an hour, but it still collides in 135 minutes. Now it's fine for me. I love wine and I love to hear about controversy that rages in my business. But not everyone wants so much. <br /> <br /> Nossiter flashes around the world, from Brazil to France to California to Italy to Argentina, talking to wine producers and PR people and consultants and critics of the vineyard condition. The theme that emerges is that globalization and wine critic Robert Parker's exaggerated influence forces a kind of conscience on wine. Small local producers are either bought by major conglomerates (both American and local) or are being squeezed by market forces to change their wines to suit Mr. Parker's palate that dictates taste to most US markets. <br /> <br /> It's a complicated topic and I can understand why Nossiter wants to talk his subjects. There are Robert Mondavi, the patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in the Languedoc face opposition from local vignons and officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and wine producer of Daumas Gassac, iconoclastic opponent of Mondavia's plans and crusaders for wines expressing local terror. There is Robert Parker himself who expresses some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines he favors. There is "flying winery" Michel Rolland, a consultant for dozens of wineries around the world, and advises them on how to make Parker-friendly wines. There are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you would like to look for the 10-part series and the theatrical version of this movie. But even if you are not in wine, the film is an interesting look at how globalization forces change many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. The effects on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
