"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary for HBO about two pairs of heroin-dependent lovers roaming the streets of NYC. I managed to catch it one night by accident and found it quite fascinating. There is no narrative, and we never see interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely detached. The people who follow, do not even think they are being filmed! (or at least they don't seem to care). The recordings are incredibly honest. Some of the most honest I've ever seen. This is just as true as it gets. Nuts and bolts of what it is to be on the street and dependent on heroin. We see them score double, shoot it, make up, penetrate and even imitate the police to rob people and about a million other small details that less attentive documentaries would leave. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures are really horrible. Like looking at a guy who frantically sought after, he got lost. I found myself praying that he would find it just because his misery would end temporarily. And when he finds it, the guy dances literally in the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of drug abuse becomes very evident while viewing this. Everything is about getting the next score for these people, but the next score seems to be worth the enormous problems they are going through. <br /> <br /> I would love to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
