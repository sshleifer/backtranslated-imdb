OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. It's hard to define why a movie touches or connects you or not, and I won't try to analyze such a perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)! Everything is old-fashioned here, from women's clothing (sigh!), Mambo dance, "hero song" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in ... Arabic :)!). Hubert is physically impressive, but stupid as hell. From all the 007s he looks like Sean Connery, but is definitely more sympathetic because he's ... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies, and there are rumors about him. In short, like an anti-hero, he rocks :)! Sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or wrinkles, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the true queen of the movie. Graceful, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatal kind. It's surprising to see her that "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You just can't compare it to "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) to be respectful of the genre. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "chicken fight" with the masked villain. But the really perfect one is when you chat in the cocktail with its contacts, how they all mutate platitudes with confidence ... This scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.
