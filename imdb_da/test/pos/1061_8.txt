This movie is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies just become entertaining and fun, become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely "A good thing" that Martha Stewart (appropriate) would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this movie, and Dennis Morgan complements her perfectly. Both have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are signs like this today? Not a role could have been better cast. Fortunately, Bette Davis dismissed this role as under her, and she was entitled to reject it. She would have tried to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely ruined the movie. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play this easily. She has rarely been more appealing and is perfect. Morgan is the essence of the lovely guy. Because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. Just the fact that he was able to keep himself surrounded by so different character actors is a feat in itself, but he is also perfect as Jefferson Jones. Skip the seven recommended (and meaningless) 1992 remake and see this bright, sparkling holiday gift!
