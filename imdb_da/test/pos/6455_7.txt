Clearly the pattern of the first gangster movies that Warner produced the same year, Little Ganges (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster movie is one of the better efforts I've seen. Although it is not quite in the same league as the classics mentioned earlier, it has a strong performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She is magnificent and delivers her lines more naturally than perhaps someone did at that time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage of his career and shows signs of what would follow in the next few years as he climbed to the top. The movie has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (never seen him this terrible) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him acting on hoodlum). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voice-over to show a person Thoughts appear in this movie. If you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, don't let the chance pass.
