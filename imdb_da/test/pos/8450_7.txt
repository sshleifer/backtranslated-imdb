"China Syndrome" launched a large number of films about the potentially devastating effects of abused nuclear power, a black paranoid cloud that would hang over America in many of the Reagan years. It is a well-functioning and efficient drama, given an extra blow to its high-performing stars, especially Jack Lemmon, who plays a senior civil servant in the nuclear power plant suffering from a crisis of conscience. But one cannot help but believe that it was the serendipitous timing of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident that occurred only a few weeks after this film's release, which has given it its enduring appeal as a classic from the 70's. It is certainly not classic. <br /> <br /> With a red-haired Jane Fonda as news reporter and bearded Michael Douglas as her cameraman (and the movie's producer by the way). <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
