LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Film's biggest flops. It received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper's career in the wake of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST controversy. All this is unfortunate because LIFEFORCE is actually a really good movie. It is extremely entertaining, moving at a fast pace and incorporating some of the most outrageous over-the-top directions, production, performances and special effects that ever explode across the screen! It must have been bizarre on paper: the producers of DELTA FORCE, the writer Alien, the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the special effects guides of STAR WARS ... The audience was not ready for this demented exercise in the oddity . <br /> <br /> What more do you want ??? We got a strange spaceship full of giant bats! We have a sexy, nude space vampire who sucks people's souls! We have explosive bodies! We have zombies! We got possession! We got an S&M inquiry! We were on fire all over London! It's Dracula Meetings NIGHT FOR THE LIVING DEATH MEETINGS QUARTERLY MASS AND WHITE MEETING EARTHQUAKE. It may be the only most outrageous horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever loosened, that is, if there are others out there. Try to watch this movie while chemically changing. Maybe you understand. A truly f *** ed up experience, and one of director Tobe Hooper's most underrated movies. Maybe one day it will find its audience.
