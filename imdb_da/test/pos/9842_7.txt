This from the social dramas that WB knew how to put together and was guaranteed box office hits in the thirties. These early "deadly children" are sent to a reform school where they are abused. Cagney, a gangster under an agreement, is appointed as Commissioner for the School. He does not take it seriously at first, but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the boys' lives. The idea is to let boys rule and manage their communities. Whether this is a healthy social reform is beyond my faith, but it is a movie. It's much like Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. An unusable happy ending tells what affects the scene before too hard, but it is still good. WB would later make the same movie with Bogart in Cagney / fatherly role.
