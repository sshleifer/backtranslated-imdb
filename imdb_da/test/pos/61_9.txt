Lackawanna Blues' centerpiece is the character Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a guest house and provides unflagging support for a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the movie. Based on the experience of author actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the New York boardinghouse and promotes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is almost non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the guest house. Nanny's ability to "take fragments and make them whole" affects everyone within her sphere. A particular live scene is when she confronts a violent man and tells him firmly, "If you ever touch that child, we'll dance!" As provided by actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so rigid and filled with such a decision that the man with the hairless temper is frozen in his tracks. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Merkerson gives an upcoming presence. Her character ties together the boundaries of life in her home. This was a touching, fervent movie with a wonderful cast. As played by Merkerson, the character of Nanny simply exudes love. This is a movie experience that I will remember for a long time to come.
