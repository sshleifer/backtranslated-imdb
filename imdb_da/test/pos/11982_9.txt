Just looked at this movie over the weekend and I have to say I enjoyed it thoroughly. The two Italian actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by two fantastic films from the past directed by the Italians. He was primarily influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It is the story of two young men who meet randomly and become friends. One is outgoing and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together, and at the end of the day it learns shyly that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony. The same goes for Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending, and this has apparently affected the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with a twist. I was expecting something, but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. If you see both movies, you will understand. The other movie that influences the director is AFTER TIMER directed by the great Italian American scoring. I highly recommend all 3 movies !!
