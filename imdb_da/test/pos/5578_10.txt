I heard about this series in 2001, which one of my friends recorded television every week. I have never bothered to see even though I became acquainted with the series through the magazine, which I looked at every now and then in bookstores. I recently purchased a DVD series and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series. The signs initially seem unlikeable, but it's amazing how fast they grow and evolve into a united strength. As they start to bother each other, it becomes easy to take care of what is happening to them (given that this is only a television series and they are fictitious). But it is not the PC world of Star Trek and so, while each figure shows a good move, they each have their own mistakes and demons that they have to deal with. Indivual story lines blended in with an overall multi-story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I absolutely enjoy seeing that each of the characters interacts with each other. This weird new world we are introduced to is excellently portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton, and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, being chased by a sign that will Having him dead and being treated as subordinate to his peers, we can easily relate to what he must feel. As he gets used to his surroundings, viewers and his compassionate, strong and courageous character see a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> I've seen only seven episodes of Farscape season one and look forward to continuing through the seasons two and four and mini series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended view and worth putting time aside to see. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
