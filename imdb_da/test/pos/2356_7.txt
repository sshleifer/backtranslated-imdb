Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza, which was the biggest commercial success for Westerners in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of watchdogs and misfits to save two white women held by the Indians, which is pretty much everyone there for this movie. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home TV, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers get rid of the ladies and are persecuted by the Indians until the white men stand on an island in a brook. The Indian weapon comes to the audience without a stop all the way through, and a spray of tobacco juice directed at a rattler is thrown on a good scale. Madison was quite popular as TV's Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a staggered cattle rifle that gets its grateful task of the army. For all the film's Polish and presentation, the film was made in just three days.
