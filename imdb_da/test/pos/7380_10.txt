Dude, I thought this movie rocked. Perfect to just sit alone and watch as 3:00 with just you and a bottle. All the time you see it, you think of WTF? What to do next .... Dude, just come with chicken already. Okay ..... they are pickin mushrooms ... this is odd ... but a little boring cool. Damn this whole movie has an erotic dirty cheeky cold evil undertone to it ... it's subtle dance just keeps you drawn on it ... you're just waiting for someone to get whacked. But the hell ... WTF! You get it and then some. For the morally disgusting stomach, it is good to drive to the toilet for barf material. Any movie that can get that kind of reaction out of you deserves a price.
