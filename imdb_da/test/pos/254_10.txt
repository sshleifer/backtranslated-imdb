I just re-watched 08th MS Gundam for the 2nd time. It's so much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get the DVD and see what was edited out of the series. It is great to see that Gundams actually moves clumsy through the country. Someone really thought about writing this move script. <br /> <br /> See it here today.
