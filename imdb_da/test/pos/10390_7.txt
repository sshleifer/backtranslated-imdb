Although the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and its visuals so calm and poetic that it can almost carry the whole movie. The film consists of four coherent stories, all about different aspects of attraction between man and / or woman and how it is often ethereal. Their true desire always seems to be something they cannot hold on, it will flow out like a handful of sand. I thought the most exciting story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more one wanted her. It is parallel to her deep love for God, which is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart. A very good movie. 10.7
