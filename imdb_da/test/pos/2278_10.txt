You should like baseball, and at least be like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former big star who finds himself acting (?) To Japan as his career wins. Really thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supportive performances by Selleck's manager ("Japan's Clint Eastwood"), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, it's really a very nice romantic movie except baseball. Look for Haysbert as a fellow before he became a persistent shill for Allstate. Film wraps very nicely. Easy in my top fifty films and maybe my favorite on baseball.
