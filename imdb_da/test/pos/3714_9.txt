Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a short film, a movie that has enough history, feel and great filmography for a feature film and definitely leaves you more in the end. The story involves two poor Mississippi brothers, one only a child, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, who played brilliantly by novice Jonathan Furr, will not let his elder brother go, and he sets out to enter the army himself. Ron Perlman gives a gruff, but touches reverence as the army colonel who decides to help the child. Because it is only 39 minutes long, this gem will be hard to find (it will most likely be limited to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider - this image marks him as an instructor to watch.
