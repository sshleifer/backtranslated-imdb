This new pass to the Child's Play series does not have a scary scene, but tons of fun jokes like a stoner, which testifies to Chucky, give him his finger and say "rude f-doll" and many references to the series: "You can kill me but I will come back. I always come back ". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is quite different from any other movie in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all of the past. Chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running together to get married. There is a cool deepening scene with broken glass and water being played everywhere. The film is very gory, very fun, and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS ONE BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER THREE. It will really ruin the effect as the first is really scary. Lots of guilty fun fun and silliness. <br /> <br />
