the most "spiritual" movie I've seen in a long time. maybe ever. also a scene around the dining table a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date comes up in the fall. If it comes to your city and you want to see a movie that makes you believe it is. Aviva is great in it, and she is definitely a future star - (Superbad is out now as she is) - all the actors also seem perfectly calibrated. There is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise you. I didn't want to know what to call it - it's comedy, but the undergirding message is so hard and direct that "comedy" is not a big enough word for it. I love this movie. It's a thinking man's comedy. But even that phrase is not really good enough. The FTF has a message and that message should be heard right now
