One kind of western I enjoy much is when the apparent weak, who is reluctant to fight and respond to the strong challenge, finally decides there is no other way. There is a good moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the salon and decides to stand up to the wild boar Wade Matlock. It is the type of scene that makes the audience applauded. In my opinion, the violent men are a great Western, I would rank it among the best. It makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular landscape of the mountains. The women have a crucial role to play. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel that she only uses him as a means of getting out there and moving east. She wants him to sell the ranch whatever price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her damned man Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do everything to have an ever-greater ranch and more power. Meanwhile, she betrays her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything happening, but feels rude to respond because she doesn't want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all the small peasants and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor rope. Just as he had warned Lee, "Don't let me fight because you don't want my fight".
