FALCON AND SNOWMAN is an excellent example of an anti-80s movie. While many other films from the decade generally lacked substance, this film is pure substance. There is nothing stylish or false or superfluous about it. It boasts two amazing performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lively friends, respectively, Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors, all of whom were on their way to much bigger and better things (all 3 stars in TAPS). While Penn and Cruise's popularity has increased, Hutton has been largely forgotten and it's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar to play the role of ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding. Hutton really catches post Vietnam war rebellion in his character Chris Boyce. A failed school student, Chris has a love affair with his father, well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem, which his father thought he had long forgotten, is a particularly powerful one. Chris gets a job at the Ministry of Defense and uses his hatred for US government and foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans for old projects to the Soviets. He gets his friend Daulton, a hyper-doping self-serving, to be the curator of the project plans on microfilm. While Chris does so based on his beliefs, Daulton makes it strictly for the money. The Soviet connection is played excellently by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a really quirky chemistry and it is a kind of fun set of exchanges between them. But make no mistake, this movie is anything but that. It is a serious character study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust. Again, the leaders are leading this movie. Hutton delivers an excellent undervalued performance like Chris, a pretty smart young man who had so much potential. Penn, as usual, makes a huge characterization like Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he believes, and most of it doesn't even think. The end of this fact-based movie is very sad at several levels. A really strong character study.
