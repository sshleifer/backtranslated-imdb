David Lynch shot his first movie 'Erasurehead' for several years and added new scenes every time he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith did 'Clerks' at work while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that 'From Dusk Till Dawn' costs just $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaning agent at a cemetery. And what if an aspiring film producer had not only such a work but also had the whole ambition of such fixtures and all of Smith's dorkishness, but absolutely none of the talent. One such figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary that chronicles his attempt to make a few films for many many years. Borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with planes of depression and a deadly inability to call it a day; one feels that he almost prefers the endless work of seeking an impossible perfection for a residential area with the reality that he is simply (on the evidence in "American Movie") not very good. And as a modern Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of other losers, his true love for whom is his greatest redeeming trait. The collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own effortless children and best of all his old uncle bill. Bill can live in a trailer park and has almost given up on life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be precise) and the touching, but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is at the heart of the movie. Borchardt manages to utilize a few players to perform (along with himself of course), but essentially he is completely dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill has a role on the camera). On British television, the BBC brilliantly planned a screening of 'American Movie' back-to-back with 'Lost in La Mancha', the story of Terry Gilliam's poorly neglected attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. In that movie, you were impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display (insufficient for the task at hand), and equally awful is even for millions of millions of people to make a movie; while Borschadt is not only merciless but also such a clown that he cannot even pronounce on the name of his own work ('Coven') correctly. Ultimately, Borschadt is human enough that you want him to succeed, but awful enough for the viewer to still laugh at his failures. If this movie were fiction, you would reject it as incredible; But as it is one of the funniest documentaries you will probably see.
