I watched this movie at the lowland festival (23rd, 24th, 25th August) after one of my friends said this is a very cool movie about the skating history. I didn't understand what to expect from this movie. Was it busy with a couple of skaters who thought they could make a few great tricks, or was it a documentary about skating. <br /> <br /> So I went in after waiting for about an hour of expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a good job about starting skateboarding. It started with the zephyr team, who was a nice group of surfers. This takes place in a not so nice area to live in. At some point the waves are not so good to surf on. So they try something else. Skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team during that time, you were one of those cool guys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place they lived with the zephyr team. Then they all tried new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> In no time was skateboarding popular again. There were a few competitions and a national competition. The Zephyr team participated in several competitions and also the national. But what they did there skateboards was incredible. But the jury did not now do how to judge them. So they put the whole skateboarding world upside down. Still, I can tell you the rest of the film / documentary, but you have to see this with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. This movie got a lot of style for me, so I rewarded it with an 8th greetings from gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.
