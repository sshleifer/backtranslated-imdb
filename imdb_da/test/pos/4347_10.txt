Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie in the series and my favorite movie ever. This movie does not take itself seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social comments needed were transcended in the first movie. Golan and Globus made this movie for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as "garbage bin" and "a tired entry into a worn series". These statements would be true if the movie were made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement, but it was not. If you take it as it is, DW3 is just a fun, action-packed romp, with Charlie making street punks what we all want we could do. The action is not stopped, the atmosphere is great, and the movie is just out and about the best Bronson flick ever made. You can tell that the penny pinching cannon group spent a lot of money on this. It is believed that Bronson believed this movie was too violent and that was why Winner did not search any of the following items. I can understand his concern, but as is always the case with successors, push the envelope even further to pass an earlier entry. In any case, this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time. What makes the DW3 the best of the series and my favorite movie ever (not the best, just my favorite), is the action, Charlie's presence, memorable villains, and it's the ability to make viewers jump on the band. The first movie can be the most technically well-made, but one is the most fun. For once, Charlie has some clever lines (though he doesn't say much) and a half-way interesting story, photograph, action and direction to back him up. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one. Yes, it is exploitative, it may promote stereotypes, and may be the same story as before, but Bronson's film always and always will stand to defend the common man and give his audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is that the movies do not manipulate us, the fans are the ones responsible. We require Bronson to blow away deserved foam, and again Winner and Co. the goods. And for those of you who still want to shut it down, remember a few things. DW3 was the # 1 movie in America when it came out and was among the favorite favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all movies should be epics, they just have to be funny. ********** / 10 You can't get any better.
