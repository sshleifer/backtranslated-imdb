This movie deserves the 10 I give it. But it's not the 10 you want to give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that just makes you laugh, over and over again! It's the most horrible written and directed movie, but it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I watched this movie today on TV and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why! <br /> <br /> (The entire college stands around Manisha, who has just undergone a rape, and the men who tried rape ask for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Poor guy 2: Yes, we won't do that again. <br /> <br /> (No answer from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman and even dead men can be awakened by you! And these are living young men! Don't blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yes Manisha .. <br /> <br /> Manisha (To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break their hands, legs and kill them. But anyway, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them then it will be as if you are too arrogant of your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now it's a true masterpiece in a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munish) can pretty much do anything. He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his back and just as easily make it disappear again. <br /> <br /> Each actor turns to talk. A line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. This is the main rule followed by the instructor so that the same screen time is given to each guy. And then there are all powerful pendants that can cause even a speed car to run straight through you without being damaged! All these things make it an enjoyable movie and I can see it again and again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it didn't try to be fun.
