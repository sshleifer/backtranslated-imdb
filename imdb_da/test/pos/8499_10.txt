My wife wanted to watch this movie and I went grudgingly together. I have never been a big fan of the biopic - believe that the cinema is more exciting when it is not structured in non-fiction. Besides that, although I like Ray Charles' music, it's just fine, I don't consider myself a fan of him or his music. I expected to suffer or coast through this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting story told in a classic movie style. Realism is in the nuances - tilting a character's head for a dramatic moment or appearance in their eyes as they sing. I have literally discovered myself involved in this movie during watching it. <br /> <br /> Much has been said, Jaime Foxx leads a casting of immaculate re-creators of not just a time but an ERA, a life that never really existed for those of us under forty. This movie sinks the audience on time without gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of the Titanic or other period pieces of the ilk. This movie does not present you with the 50's and 60's music scene, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your understanding of it should not be limited to his life. It's the kind of movie that saves Ryan or Schindler's List, it does what a movie has to do - bring you to another place, another time.
