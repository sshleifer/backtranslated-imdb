I saw all the doctors who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up (introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee) as well as "camera copies" by a doctor who sent to the US by British fans to their American counterparts. I had a good time with the show, but it never seemed to be serious - I mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. I went to CONs, cost bit (Doctor No. 5.6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it. Then it all came to a sudden stop. program policy and lack of interest and funding became a doctor who entered a 25-year-old antiquity, who ran into ethos. <br /> <br /> When I heard that the sci-fi channel had downloaded the new doctor was my first thought "Cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I've been talking about all these years, and know what's a TARDIS "(I have several phone boxes and TARDISs of different sizes around the house) I didn't expect the excellent quality of history, character development and f / x. I should say the least. For the first time I found a doctor who was not a curmudgeon, a clown, a dummy, a pulling head, a pussy or a jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Now, now, funny down empty bakers fans! Don't make me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but Christopher gave something to the doctor he'd never had before - real words of credibility. I'm just sorry he decided on another season. I will try David Tennant as I would have any other doctor, but now the rod has risen ... bad wolf rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 update - I love David tennant! his "courageous" persona is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can cope and the fashion gestapo can relax! he is a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other doctors. I miss the rose, I dig martha, and what did they think about donna noble!?!? It's still the best trip on TV
