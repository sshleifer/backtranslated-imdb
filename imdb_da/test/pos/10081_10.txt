Is this a bad movie? Of course, what do you expect from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> It's a "BABES in BIKINI" movie and has no pretensions to be otherwise. Given, this is not "a room with a view" or "SCHINDLER'S LIST." If you wanted a movie like "A room with a view" then you wouldn't look at Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you're looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie with almost no plot, this is for you. This flick delivers on what it promises and then some. It's pure 100% youth fun. <br /> <br /> There were lots of BABES in and out of bikinis. The movie was quite fun and amazing to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I have ever seen at home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school kid should see at least one bad movie like this one. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. So indescribable I say again ... If you only want to see a "Babes in Bikini" movie, this is it.
