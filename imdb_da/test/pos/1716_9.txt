Russell T Davies has been tasked with recreating a slice of my childhood: hiding behind the couch and watching scary monsters battle with dr. Who. He and his crew are clearly all true devotees from the original series. Just as the Star Trek movies used their budget to make Gene Rodenberry's original concept far more credible, Russell T Davies has both the money and the benefits of excellent CGI to create the best monsters ever. I'm sure this series was made with a budget that expected both export and DVD sales, and it really feels like no expense was spared. <br /> <br /> The associated series Dr Who Confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind-the-scenes insight. Interviews with cast and writers help to tell the story from every letter perspective and is far more useful than just seeing the whole program again. How does David Tenant place in the pantheon of his famous predecessors? The time will tell, but tonight, when Billie Piper played with Elisabeth Sladen, who was a doctor's companion in the 1970s, she confirmed that she has both plays, screen presence and script for No. 1.
