So good that acting, cutting, controlling in there is perhaps not the best ever, but the dance, the movements, the warmth and the passion of this movie are definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^) it really touched me, inspired me to learn to dance. I'm even specially registered on this site just so I could vote for it and contribute my support to this movie. For this movie I literally gave goose bumps when I saw it. I love it. Jennifer Gray is so beautiful! Patrick is so sexy in there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I must do tomorrow on the way to the university will be to drop by the video store. n buy a copy of it. n see it again n again until I'm old n wrinkle n can't dance with the movie anymore. sooner than i need to learn all the dance moves there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
