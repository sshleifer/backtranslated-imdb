I have just chosen this in a decent, if not unique, DVD version for a dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Get out and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure this version is the short, incomplete version released against the animator's wishes at the end of the fifties, yet it's in a buck an * incredible * offer. <br /> <br /> This movie was syndicated in small pieces as a serial to local TV stations in the early 60s for the baby's shows that almost every station ran at everyday meetings these days - "Bill and Bozo "," Monty's Gang "(Channel 4, Greenville SC) and" Captain Grady "(Channel 13, Asheville NC - which is where I saw it). It made such an impression on twelve or so old me that I recognized it immediately when I saw it in Wal Mart tonight and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
