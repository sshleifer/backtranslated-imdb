I know you should not comment on other users' comments, but I would say that many of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan project and were annoyed by things that were omitted. (From his book 'Smoking in bed' it seems that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is another such.) I knew very little before I saw the movie and found the rivet. Dwight Schultz is completely mesmeric as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he doesn't get better roles and more leading parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. You can stifle with different script or direction choices, but as it is, the movie is extremely intense and awful at times, and generally I give it four stars out of five.
