Despite its many flaws, the Hallmarks 1995 version of Gulliver's Travels is still the finest adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical classic - largely because it not only covers all of Gulliver's many journeys, but also the often overlooked satire. Unfortunately, twin problems remain in the book's very episodic structure and a TV budget (even a rather sumptuous). The book is a slightly wandering collection of travelers' tales that only move from one surrealistic landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation tries to impose chaos by giving a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returned to England, clearly clearly traumatized and trying to prove his way out of the crazy asylum, where rival for his wife's hardships has got him committed. England's scenes immediately mirror and comment on the journey, whose elements occasionally jump into the real world. The problem is that for the first hour or so it seems more like a distraction that constantly pulls you away from the story, just as it begins to become interesting. The Lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive pieces - this must be the only version where we can't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him. Although Gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and even the chain of the Jews of the Utopias of Brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men on the floating island of Laputa who is so confused in science that they have no Common sense remains, the guest / prisoner of a historian, who places history directly from the source, offered immortality with all the terrible consequences before finally finding a world he will hear if he can only convince the sublime talking horses Houynhnhms that He is not an uncivilized Yahoo, every new destination convinces him of what an absurd and petty kind of humanity is. Mostly it is a darker set of travel than expected, with only Gulliver's curiosity and devotion and disappointment keeping it from falling into irrevocable gloom - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum area, where it becomes more obvious that even though he is telling the truth, it may well have driven him really crazy. It is in these latter scenes that Ted Dansons Gulliver really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech, turning his testimony into a disappointed judgment over all humanity. <br /> <br /> Watching television, Yahoos is a little less literally scatological here than on the side, but for the most part it is a more adult treatment than one might expect without any real dumbing. The starboard is certainly impressive, and mostly well-used (if it is short in a few cases) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard , Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It's hard to imagine that the upcoming Jack Black version itself comes close to being a fraction as impressive as this one.
