I was swept into this series as surely as the sea would sweep me in its grip. Although it started slowly, I found out that realism in portraying the ship, the many characters and the lively dialogue enables me to see. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change this journey, and I would be there for it. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional overlays, interaction and expression - relentless and compelling to observe. The ship's movement added an almost imaginative component to the many scenes, making the characters sick for a moment and adding humor to the next. Edmund Talbot is a complex sign that we do not see often. We can know where the captain stands, or Mr Prettiman, but they are older men put in their paths. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learned, tried himself and tested. He struggled to get along with others and made mistakes that a real person wanted, but had a heart that could be touched that grew with every very educational experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; It's too rare in movies and TV.
