This amazing movie never came up in my town, so I actually didn't have the opportunity to see it until the late 80s when I caught it on German television. I had expected some of a disaster, and instead found a functioning grand western with great location work. The little tube couldn't really hurt it, and there is almost no dull moment in this 4-hour movie, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What play would it be! Don't miss it if you ever have the chance. Unfortunately, the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" at the opening destroyed Michael Cimino's career and he moved from the "Dragon Year" to the astonishingly ridiculous ("The Sicilian") and the frighteningly stupid ("Desperate Hours").
