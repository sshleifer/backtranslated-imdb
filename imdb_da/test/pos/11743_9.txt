This movie always hits me hard emotionally at the end. Although the film's problems - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond the narrow parameters of groundbreaking novelty and exciting dazzling uniqueness. Here we have a true love story, as written by the woman involved in this love affair, told in a brilliant aggressive style that promotes the virtues and glory of crazy passionate love. I "love" this endorsement of the only feeling that makes life really worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace, and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful movie that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet been in love, it is just the hope that one day lightning strike can strike for you, making life worth living - because love is worth having though but in a short time - even if you lose - because love is the "thing" - the essence - of life. This movie works for me. A warm feeling experience!
