I do not understand why this show did not go, there could have been different ways to continue on the Darwin and Farik line after Season 2, of course Darwin could not have been the UC agent's infiltrating cells and sabotage them from the inside, but they should still have given this show at least another season. The show is well-cast, trustworthy and sees the Islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view. It touches on controversial issues in detail, and it has a dramatic significance that can be said about very few shows today. I'm actually sorry I didn't know about this show until the end of 2007.
