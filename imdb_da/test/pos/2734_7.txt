15 Park Avenue, well named mystifies originally being an address from New York and movies being put in Kolkata. But as the story unfolds, one understands the thin line that the director tries to go between relationship, social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has so much more to say and has so little time available. Now she has no doubt managed to make a good movie. In a way, she makes us realize that we are probably each seeking our own '15 Park Avenue '. It's an endless search within each of us ... <br /> <br /> Shabana Azmi's Powerhouse performance is an experience to see. Her screen presence brings lots of life into the scene. It was actually surprising to see her in such a powerful act after a long time, because I expected to be all the way to Konona Sen's terrain. Shabana makes you feel the skin deep of an older sister who runs the whole show for a rather unfortunate family, and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. She burdens all her ambitions and desires with a failing 18-year-old sister (who is more like a daughter to her) and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for the leading actress from Guide (that's how I remember her right away), there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. Yet reliable Rahul Bose plays another important role in the movie, showing the feelings of a medieval man of repentance on his face to almost perfection. This man really wonders me about the diversity of work he has done. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others ??. He's a versatile one I really want if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie too. The como in the movie is by Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks really beautiful and portrays the role of a mother of 2 children with real ease. She gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's past relationship. <br /> <br /> The camera's focus has been Meethi, portrayed by the Konona. She and her schizophrenic world are at the heart of 15 Park Avenue. She has really worked hard for the character, but there are times when she is unable to relate to the audience. The fatal accident in his life tries to hang in sympathy, and it has only been partially successful. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to deal with a lot of things at once, starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today's modern India and also the twisted relationships of a tattered family. And I think the monkeys have succeeded to some extent. Meethi's helplessness, while working as a journalist in an eastern eastern state, gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> Now, after I finished 15 Park Avenue, there was a sense of unexplored thirst in me. I wanted more from this movie to kill me emotionally. It has been a commendable effort on the part of the director, with the exception of a few hiccups. Look at all those who like to see another movie theater, something with a strong purpose.
