I feel this movie is different from so many others because it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may be wrong, but bitterness and closures have no place with these girls. Try to find it on TV or in the usual movies. It is a fresh breath to see girls being feminine - wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast it with the clothing in the shops today, ie raggedy and faded jeans and jackets etc. The story has a bad thread that runs through, but it makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you the feeling that families can stick together and get out okay. I would recommend this movie to both boys and girls.
