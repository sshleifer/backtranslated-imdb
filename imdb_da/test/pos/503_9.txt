For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and <br /> <br /> techno bar is incredible. I would probably follow her for my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie all the time, but with a twist. Fight scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes shows an athleticism you don't see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as an ambitious new recruitment that moves up the hierarchy on any basis. Great flick 9/10. Where is Blade II?
