Simon West's pg-13 thriller about a babysitter getting disturbing prank calls while sitting on a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good movie. Although there are some elements of excitement, good eye-wash and decent signs, the movie is just another. I know what you did last summer as it has not been taken seriously. The performances were okay, but nothing special about this flick, I say skip it unless you are looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better movies than this on life sometimes, maybe not life, but at least the US or something. , haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
