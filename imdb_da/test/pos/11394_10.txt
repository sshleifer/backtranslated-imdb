What needs to be changed in today's attitude to movies like Boogie Nights is the approach. The access is horrible! Compares it with Pulp Fiction, only looks pornography and all its aspects. Come on people who are more than that in this beautiful movie. And for all the skeptics, Paul Thomas Anderson has not proven worthy again and again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I look at American films at all and still trust this "industry" that filmmaking is today .. And what about blood? It's a movie that will be in movie history, whether you like it or not! Yes you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! You don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. So many artists are struggling today for recognition, and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious movies, even mainstream, because people just want to see celebrities doing stupid things .. like the sold out Britney spears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was very painful for me to say because I don't want to see this, I don't think today is all that matters to add numbers .. sales revenue and sales proceeds .. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the cinema language. Because that's what PTA is doing ... he creates magic !!
