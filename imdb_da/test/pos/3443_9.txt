I totally agree with my previous commentator on describing this as a fast-paced, fascinating and surely beautiful movie. It is not necessary to see all the episodes as the first ones are the best, while the latter are a bit tiring, but for every person who likes the Germans and their good-natured ways, all episodes are worth seeing. In typical German fashion, values ​​are constantly questioning, although it is murderous Nazi past confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is living or traveling in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
