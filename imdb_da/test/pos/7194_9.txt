I saw Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic cartoon. Like the comic, the whole movie is full of jokes based on proverbs, anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags that rarely fall. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a pot of strength to fight the Roman legions in their native Gaul. Here they end in Egypt and help a friend build Cesar's palace (yes it is boring) in three months to prove the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. The reason I chose this was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She is good, but the role is a little more than a cameo. But even though she is rarely in the movie, I didn't care when it was so wise and the jokes so funny I was in hysteria. I loved it. I loved it so much that I can't understand why the movies have never been released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The Import DVD has the movie in English dub - which is quite good, especially when you consider it when you see it in the longer French version, the proverbs (and hence the jokes) are not always clear as they is responsive, so if you read the names incorrectly, the jokes are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English double seem to be exactly the same, although some have been changed at times for the better and sometimes for the worse. Personally, I will stick to the dub when I see this again, as it is easier to get the jokes and enjoy humor. You really want to see this if you love puns and low forehead, but clever humor This is a great comedy
