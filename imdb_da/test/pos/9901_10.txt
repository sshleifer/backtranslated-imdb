'Checking Out' is an extraordinary film that towers over most film productions. The refreshing, witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. On the contrary, the film explores diverse facets of human spirit and human relations. Its heat approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all people. The characters are charming and entertaining, reflecting the idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh at ourselves. The quick dialogue and the witty booties will keep you on your toes and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter as you will not miss a single sentence! You will probably see it in the cinema and then again (over several times) on video, and each time you will discover something new. After each viewing, you are sure to feel warm and uplifted.
