Ann-Margret did the best work she has ever done in her story about film making. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two films by Ann-Margret, I haven't seen since her movie debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel she has been totally underestimated in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in "Who Will Love My Children", she was overlooked. As she was nominated for an Oscar for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", she became snubbed. All in all, I think everyone did a great play, including all the kids in "Who Will Love My Children." Yes, it's a sad movie (like true stories can be) but worth the time. Thank you.
