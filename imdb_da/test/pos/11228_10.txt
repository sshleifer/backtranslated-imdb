The third film from the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. Although many audiences will have a problem with Northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structures, "Stick with it, Jack!". The reason is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story contains: agents trying to evacuate a city, God in a cowboy hat, the sale of English wings and a sick orphan (but it all works). M. David Mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. The actors' performances, working with the inspiring offbeat script of the Polish brethren, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional impact. The strong will of the audience will be moved by the mythology and folk history of the story, the comics and the moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again, all these incredible and seemingly disparate elements come together in one of the most incredible things you should run and experience. A great, great, good movie !!!
