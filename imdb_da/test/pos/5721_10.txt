John Leguizamo's alone shows are hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterization and good timing, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama also achieved the first, but this time the material was fun, Freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex -o-holic. But his stuff in the Freak exhibits his genius, and when he is in the limelight, he is without peer. <br /> <br /> Freaks semi-autobiographical look at a youth's journey has power and resonance. I don't think it's the creator knew about. By giving us the chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo us an opportunity to project our own life on his and there can be no greater gift an artist can give. The willingness to let go of the 'wall', expose and share is too scary for most actors - they use signs to hide behind - but JL goes full throttle and smacks any misdemeanor. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke from their heart about what they saw in society and the truth presumed slashing humor. Combine that with an actor's gift of imitation and presently (not to mention a sense of humanity), and you'll see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in the freak he does. <br /> <br /> From birth to its first major break and every life-changing moment, a seer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments and constantly experiences the pain, hope and humor that comes with it. Looks drained and chained muscularly close JL rings with sweat at the end of the evening, offering his crazy life to an audience; Spike Lee's fluid camera work captures the actors' nuances down to the last lip curl and slow flashes. The scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing a chorus line with his gay deaf uncle; his first girlfriend is evil humiliation when he strips naked, eager to have sex. A nightmare first sexual encounter with a large German woman at the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows a failed attempt to pick up a "drunk obsolete Catholic" in a bar at St.Patty's Day. Climaxing in a serious showdown with her mother and father, this is where he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a dramatic / humorous intensity that you forget you only see a person. There are no cost changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks or makeup. Just one actor gives his everything. It is simply amazing. Other actors / comedians who stand out right now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they do not dive into themselves as deep as John Leguizamo does; It's not a criticism, not a long shot. I love their work, but the Freak is different. It moves in a non-b ******* way. It's the best man's show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.
