so. I was completely in love with this movie. gaga for it, even with all its plot twists ... but the only thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the author of the film gave us such an instantaneous moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, does he give us a plot twist that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject is not recorded in the film .... and left unexplained and unclear for) I just thought it was in bad taste and the fact that it was not even discussed is even worse. (Oops, we've created a taboo ... Let's not now address the situation, because it wouldn't really be P.) Otherwise, a spectacular movie
