This is a Hollywood movie. The credentials of the people involved are not revolutionary. This movie won't change the world. However, it is well-made, well-placed and well-traded, which counts a lot. <br /> <br /> It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably worried about this failure in the subsequent years of his career, and when the movie captures in 1992 - or determined in contemporary America - this would be the murderer Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a turn-force for creepiness where he gives transformational performance) has been used with frustration and anger and decides that he will murder the president. He imagines that he has a common cause with the secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cool, calm, good-natured grouchy best), whom he believes should be angry as he does, because the Warren Commission blames Horrigan - Unreasonably, Leary believes in the murder of President Kennedy. The excitement is ratcheted up by some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary who want to keep Horrigan close, but not to betray his place and plans. Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a co-dealer who Horrigan develops an adult relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (although Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, talented agent who is able to walk toe-to-toe with the fast-woven Horrigan in friendly skirts. It's a good deal for Russo, so she can play the role of a skilled professional woman and not just the older man's standard romantic interest. The guide Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thought-provoking use of music in plot development and excellent filmography makes it a movie I can see over and over again.
