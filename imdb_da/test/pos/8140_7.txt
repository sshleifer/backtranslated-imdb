I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because when I am shown a small town in the states, it is populated with all sorts of monsters, among which meat hungry zombies, evil aliens, and eerie ghosts are most harmless. In this movie, a former physician who has just made time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car accident leads his steps to the nearest small town - he must never have seen his life in small towns - as happens with his Purgatory Flats. And of course, as soon as he gets there, the hell goes loose. He meets a blonde chick, who out of all creatures looks most like a cow, both in facial expressions and brain function and immediately falls in love with her. But there is a small disability, she is already married to a very talented drug dealer who for a moment gets shot pitifully not dead. To know what has come out of all this, you should watch the movie for yourself. I just want to tell you that it is a bit like U Shift by Oliver Stone, but is a way down to all artistic features.
