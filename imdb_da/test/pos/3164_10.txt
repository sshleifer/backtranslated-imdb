Worth checking out. Looked at MLK's birthday 2006 and it hit me a lot of time. Sometimes it feels like we are all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past, no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is continue and talk. Just keep going. Do not mean to be a downer, because it is not intended, but maybe we have to come down before we see how much we must work on ourselves. What happens when we are told by the best people like MLK what needs to happen to pull us out of our "dead end", but we are not listening. I know some of us are listening, but how do we get the rest of the world to see the things they really are? Just keep going, I think. This movie made me think even more about all this, so I assume it has done what it should do. That's what I consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or something: something that makes you think and key up in order to move in an active direction instead of stuck and bored and hopeless.
