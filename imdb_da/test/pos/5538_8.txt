I just wanted to write a quick answer to all the people who give this movie a bad review because they think it's not fun or boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick --- the movie isn't supposed to be just a comedy. It has got a depth for it. Like many Demme movies, it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society, trying to figure out how to put together a satisfying life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie and home video industry is not doing well with subtlety and releasing it in "COMEDY" bin. It's fun, but a lot of humor is off-beat. The film's heart, however, is not about humor, but about the people in it. It may not be one of the world's greatest films, but it is solid and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Casting is one of those that shows why casting is an art for itself. Michelle Pfieffer is amazing and it may be the movie that showed she had some plays to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets chewing nature in the way she can only, in a role that requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast through which it usually makes a big difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, he is a great hottie in this movie. Hot, sweet and sexy. Sit back, expect the unexpected, and let the movie take you where it will go and you need a good time.
