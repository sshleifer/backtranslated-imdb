Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very bubbly entertainer and a very modern movie for his time in the 1960s. The music and songs are amazing, although the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless in places. Dev Anand is a huge star and as usual makes great justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is okay. Simi is also almost OK. The film has a fantastic dialogue by Vrajendra Gaur, who wrote most of Dev Anand's films such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc.etc. It's a story about Dev, attracted by three women - against Kalpana, Simi and the cozy Nanda. He eventually chooses for Nanda. The story is about OK, but it is told in a poignant way, and the dialogue and the songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. A must see movie for all Dev Anand fans.
