I think Shane Black is one of the greatest action cross-writers ever! He gave us the fantastic (at that time) deadly weapon and shot Mel Gibson into the superstars. Then it followed with the second best movie, Bruce Willis ever been in (The Last Boyscout). Stumbled a little with The Last Action Hero, but met with this, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, it has all this ... Action, Comedy, Thrills, so choose it with more action, comedy and excitement. Geena Davies is amazing, Samuel L Jackson is even bigger. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
