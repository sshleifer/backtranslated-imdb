"The Seven-Ups" acts as a rendition of "The French Connection" which was released two years earlier. Both late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco make appearances, as well as stunt driver Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we're not dealing with French drug baddies; Instead, we are dealing with a war against various caps and criminals, after a policeman has been brutally killed by a hoodle. We'll see the discomfort and a pre-1990s New York City. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to watch the action and it's a reminder of a cooler time. Having said that, when comparing car ranks, Mr Hickman had been involved in the three most-compared: This movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Each chase scene has its own qualities and this is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad this title has seen the light of day on DVD.
