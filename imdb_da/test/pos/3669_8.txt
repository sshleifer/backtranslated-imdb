Ignore any other's comments on this movie and watch it on payment cable (as I did) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This movie is what movies (must be) are about. Hard to categorize (and God knows how this was put as a "high concept"!), But it's one for the angels. Check it out. What do you have to lose?
