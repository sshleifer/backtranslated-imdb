* Flat SPOILERS * <br /> Five with students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide Trying an experiment dies in exactly 5 minutes (that is the maximum time someone can do before there is a risk of brain damage). Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they start having unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting rough insults to him, Joe sees all the women he has sex with (and as he videoed) asks him why from the TV screen Rachel revives his father's suicide and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting film set in a hallucinated city and into a gothic school, is quite the experience, both for the history and the characters played by such emerging stars as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys', and this second collaboration is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> A must for psychological thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and correction of past accidents), this is one of the lesser classics of the 80s who get respect themselves today as a review of Rebecca Gayheart in the 'Scream 2' or Tru Calling episode that used the film's premise. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
