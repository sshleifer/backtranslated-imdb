With all the boys out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often does more than it deserves, but why are people not down to "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are good models for them. Yes, they run away and create an ideal life, but it is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has come in a bad way. Eventually they have sex, but no one is forced into it. The film makes the children aware that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing is nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has Paul in a good chance of being found out. In "Paul and Michelle" they differ for a time. If you don't like the end of a movie, think up. Alternative endings are not just for DVDs.
