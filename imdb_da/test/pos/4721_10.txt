This film should be viewed by as many people as possible as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I first looked at this movie in the mid-1990s, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. It made me so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any movie that has the power to make you learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is great as the American lady who, due to personal tragedy, has become ruthless with her own life decisions and is caught in the subsequent conflict. It's a strong movie about a topic that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the massacre of Pro-democracy activists from 1988 was not television, and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. I urge anyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the Burmese people's current situation. <br /> <br /> It is time that this movie was released on DVD. Can something be done?
