This movie starts a bit slowly, but starts fast with comedy gear. Each of the three "teenage girls" offers their own trustworthy, distinct, confident and entertaining personalities. I especially enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial "action" that took place, Keith's character treated Lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also drawn in expertly in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult man who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. The dialogue was crisp, fast and fluently neat. The director and author of this movie clearly showed how none of the protagonists got to claim the moral high ground for all the traits they drew. Although the film appears as light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas where they become adults, human emotions and desires.
