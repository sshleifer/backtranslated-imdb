<br /> <br /> As cats have nine lives, I give you 9 reasons to watch this movie: The Berlioz and Toulouse kittens play the piano together (so incredibly cute!) * The hunting dogs Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jumps as electrified every time he wants to be like a hard cuddly cat * Marie sighs romantic, while the spawning cat O'Malley seduces his mother * Scat Cat and his jazz band, sings "possibly" rubbish wants to be a cat "* Stupid but real and cozy English geese Amelia and Abigail who make the cats go geese * O'Malley gets the "magic blanket" that puts the Cheshire cat to shame * Roquefort the brave muss travel to ask the help of alley cats * Edgar butler hunting scenes and transition from a good guy for an insane cat hates because of cat riddance plan gone bad
