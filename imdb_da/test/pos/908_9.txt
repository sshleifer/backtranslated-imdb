Stan Laurel considered PUTTER PANTS ON PHILIP as the first L & H movie. THE OTHER DAILY YEARS were the first 'official' L&H movie, but this was what Stan completely dismissed not only to perform (he had signed with Hal Roach Studios as director and "gag-man" in certain situations - among them Oliver Hardy's misfortune with a lamb lamb that led to Stan who was to replace him, and the extra money that would be spent would give himself and his new wife Lois - his historic return to perform as well as to write control, editing and involvement in other production areas), but also realized that he was part of a team that worked well together. It is therefore a historical and very important film in comedy history. It's also a surprisingly fun little sound movie; quite different from what Laurel & Hardy would become known to and from what they are more directly connected to today. The characters of 'Stan & Ollie' do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man about the city who is reluctant to be seen with this strange guy with a kilt and the habit of chasing beautiful girls. There are some very fun moments in this well-presented, charming little movie, and the notion of these two king of comedy is spot-on - see Stan's little "scissor kick" and smile saying "Well waddaya know?" when he sees girls or the hairy scene in the airport eg. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you can, with backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on the VVL releases), which enhances the feel of the 1920s and is very, very enjoyable to listen to. It's a brilliant and underrated little movie why I said it was surprisingly fun.
