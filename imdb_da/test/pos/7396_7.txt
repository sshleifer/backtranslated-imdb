* SPOILERS * <br /> I don't care what anyone says, this movie is friggin 'fun. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a film about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer is to be executed, taken to the execution chamber, but the truck breaks with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bound to dirt or in this case snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman was destroyed by pouring antifreeze onto him. <br /> <br /> Or they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a year after the other. Some researchers revive Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation has ever been given to why they do what they just do. Meanwhile, the sherrif, who arrested Frost in the first, has gone to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all. It has carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you hold them in their mouths and kill snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like babies. I need to give decision makers this credit. The snowballs are some of the sweetest little things that have ever dreamed of. I wish I could get one as a pet. Frost eventually freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence large weather patterns. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There is Manners, the FBI agent from the first movie, except here he has an eye catch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I'm a FBI AGENT! Yarrr! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The fruitiest man on the planet's surface bore none. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary but it's fun. I laughed my ass all the way through and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
