By drawing 2.6 million viewers, one must wonder what everyone's opinions on the story / plot are. <br /> <br /> Reading the downturn over life I was led to believe that this would be an edge-of-your-seat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Although the main plot is interesting enough - Single mother runs away from the road one night, then it is spoiled by the same guy, the reason behind stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth. Laura Leighton plays the victim and she does well. Whether it was all these years at Melrose Place or not, she's doing well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm, and she looks great these days. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the protagonist, after discovering why the stalker is stalking, it will be a viewing-only-once type of movie.
