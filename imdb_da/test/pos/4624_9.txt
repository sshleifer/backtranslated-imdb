2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone and subject with movies such as Bully, Elephant and Kids (though in my view, 2:37 is a superior movie for the three). My expectations were neutral, but I ended up getting a very good impression thanks to the intelligent manuscript, Murali K. Thalluri's perfect direction and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. The sporadic examples of school violence around the world have inspired many films, television programs, and books that claim to find and predict the external or internal causes of these outrageous expressions of rebellion, dissatisfaction ... and especially madness. Some people may say that 2:37 arrives late for the artistic movement; However, I do not think so because this delay allowed the film to carry out a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation of more subtlety and intelligence rather than the obvious reaction of cruelty and anxiety that impregnated other films with similar stories. /> <br /> On the characters from 2:37 we find clich√©s from the youth film (from director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP's film to the teen film): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "geek", the antipathetic athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to get them into hollow caricatures defined by their function in the manuscript; But it is somewhat admirable that the manuscript transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems, which more or less can find someone on their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent movie whose only flaw is that the ending feels a little affected but that compensates it with many positive elements. It will be very interesting to see Thalluri's next projects as he has had a fantastic debut with this movie.
