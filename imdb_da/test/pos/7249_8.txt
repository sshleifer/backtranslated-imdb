So it may not be entirely historical. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (son of Ridley) Scott's first attempt, it is well worth the ticket price. Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller looks as good as ever) may be a gentleman, but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on) is an apothecary-turned-outlaw. The circumstances of their strange encounter involve a dead body, a ruby, and finally a partnership like the gentlemen of the Highway. As the tagline says, "they rob the rich ... and that's it." There is not very much background or even in-depth development, but the object seems to be to facilitate the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two principal's passage to America. A small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With Chief Justice's department, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who happened to have also seen the thief taking general. <br /> <br /> The reason is original enough, casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as drag-queenish Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also together in "Trainspotting" they have not lost their dynamics), costuming is amazing, makeup is scandalous and the music is hard-edged techno with a strange classical undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good balance between acting and plot, and he's not worried about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century London. And lucky for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And Liv Tyler is also, but hey, who is this film about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett and MaCleane. But there is more to this movie than just beautiful faces. With the risk of cleaving the clich√©, it is a fast, furious and sometimes frustrating trip with the most noble highwaymen since Robin Hood. Decadent, sleazy and violent, Scott's debut film gives an entertaining evening at the cinema. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was great and it was a bloody good laugh!"
