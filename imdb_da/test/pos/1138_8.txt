Ten years before "The Matrix" and threats to the healers "De Live" came this brilliant part of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter's style movie so you will love "Split". There are moments of true genius in framing and filmography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene with cue cards. The reason involves a man named Starker who lives outside the community who wants to wake us up from the dream. Like "The Lives", "1984" and "The Matrix" it is based on the premise that we are constantly monitored by shady Big Brother-type government agents who know everything about us and have invisible robot probes that constantly patrol the city . This is all revealed quite early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that, when placed in the water supply, will wake everyone up from reality illusion. Along with the filmmaker and the brilliant ways the director does, he does with his wonderful budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone not to rewind, memorize, and quote the classic quotes from this movie in the coming years.
