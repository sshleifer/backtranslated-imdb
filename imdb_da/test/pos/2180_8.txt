Five Star Final was one of the best films in the early 1930s. The star Edward G. Robinson and was a very boring story of an insidious newspaper and their willingness to do something ... EVERYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an ancient story of an innocent woman is plastered over the sides and helps destroy her now happy life - many years after she was accidentally involved in a scandal. The reason I loved the movie so much was that it was incomplete and drew no blow - showing how low the publishers might be selling papers. <br /> <br /> Here in TWO OVER WORLD there is a remake of five STAR FINAL - with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, this movie stars Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of the programming at a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except that it is slightly less angular and lacks some of the original grit and sensationalism. This is not to say that the movie is bad - it just doesn't pack as well as the first movie. In other words, if you are going to see one of these movies, first see the first one - even if this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable. For me, I loved the story so much, I watched both movies and enjoyed them both. <br /> <br /> Two against the world begins with the UBC radio owner complaining to his programming manager (Bogart) that all the "high brow" shows he's on, gets low ratings. The owner requires muck - lots of muck to get more listeners. One way they discuss is to make a multiple dramatization of a famous killing that occurred two decades ago - even though the killer was acquitted, and she only killed in self-defense. But they decide to record the story as if she were guilty, and they even go so far that they both send a writer to the lady's home pretending to be minister (!) And broadcast her current name and residence. Needless to say, this destroys the woman and leads to a terrible tragedy. So, and only then, does Bogart feel any genuine remorse for producing such waste - leading to a dandy finale on journalistic integrity and decency. Well behaved, a great story idea and a message that is as important today as it was back in the 1930s, it is a story you should see. Particularly note the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart --- it is a whole of a good example of action and writing.
