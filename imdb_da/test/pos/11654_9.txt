"Dead Man Walking" is a film, not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case - the killer, the families whose children were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual counselor, and what happens. It tells the story with a little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD and every time I see it (not often it's never an easy movie to watch) I'm more impressed with what Tim Robbins and the whole cast did here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so convincing that you can't take your eyes away, so subtle and yet so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn't matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or even have no meaning), this movie will make you think about the issues for sure. It requires a courageous screenwriter and instructor to see this material on the face without goodbye even once, and everyone involved in the movie pulls it off - there is not a single scene that is calling fake. A masterful movie, but don't expect easy viewing ... to some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable, even if no blood or violence appears. You are drawn into this movie and become a participant, and there is a sign that almost everyone can identify with. 10/10.
