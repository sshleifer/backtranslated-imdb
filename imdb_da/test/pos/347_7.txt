I love almost everything that late Al Adamson has been addressing in his long and varied career, but "Possession of Nurse Sherri" is head and shoulders above fun, yet class Z obsessions like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein ". This movie is actually scary! Do I say you're going to jump out of your seat when you see "Nurse Sherri"? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" is one of the lovely, eerie little horror movies that are common in the 70s. You can't put your finger on what's so scary about it, but the movie drips with the atmosphere. (And what an end! Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it to this one and it doesn't matter if "Nurse Sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is sympathetic but not unique as the unhappy nurse being obsessed with a recent deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, shining in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is okay as his surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap built-in flicks), but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just window dressing. "Nurse Sherri" was a Poverty Row production, and it sometimes shows (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the movie has a heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some real chills. Sam Sherman also looked good at using Harry Lubin's theme for the early 50's / early 60's "One Step Beyond" TV series in this movie, which certainly adds to the eerie atmosphere. The DVD contains two substantially different cuts in the movie (the early version has many T&As that are run on the rocking floor to make room for more horrible things) as well as the theater trailer, the TV site and a big comment by sherman. Anyone what happened to Bill Roy by the way? Next to John Carradine, he is the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson movie, and he plays the cult leader as he means.
