I've turned my brain into another movie that reminds me of this. I really can't come up with one. I think that is because most of the movies that take on this subject (war, peace and violence) are in a fixed documentary style. There are some amazing ones out there, all better known than the US TM, but I'm sure, but they need to be informative and bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD may in some ways seem more intellectual, but it really is not. It may be philosophical, but it goes beyond information mode and goes directly to the same place a piece of music does. It makes you feel, but sometimes you don't even know why. You're just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling. When you see it, note how well it is put together. It may not be for everyone, but it is for anyone looking for a rare film creation that respects you.
