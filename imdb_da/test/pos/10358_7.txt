I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London Film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but it may be closer to Amores Perro's structure and Kevin Smith's Clerks slacker mood. Four stories cross on a French highway dinner. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) bungling a team up at dinner. Waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tells him his story. The other has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) taking a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family does not seem to have her back. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars that come together at dinner (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The last part is about four ex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old shadow, which has since been transformed into ?? diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure doesn't work right. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. The owner is also not decisive for the efforts of at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was crucial in Amores Perro's four stories. The quality of each story varies. The hidden story is a sweet idea, with a few good gags, but doesn't come out; and the rock star reunion is pointless and boring. On the other hand, the kidnap story is hilarious, although its connection to dinner is unclear. The most balanced and successful story is Franck and Suzie one. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writer / Director's Samuel Benchetrit's work.
