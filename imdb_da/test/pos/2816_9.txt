"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (pronounced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy crime fighter known as Stripperella, aka Agent 69, working for a state organization. As Stripperella, Erotica combats crime and evil forces as a plastic surgeon, giving women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal stealing from 99 cents stores and doing his two crafts with a gun. The actor of the character and series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and the creator of Spider-Man). At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) ate a Thursday night block of three animated shows. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; New adventures of classic children show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults by original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; about a lawyer who has been transformed into a man-made rat with the main chain Kelsee grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser" fame and "Stripperella"; The adventurers of a stripper doubled as a superhero pronounced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three prizes. I was eager to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little let down. It was okay, but it seemed to take things a bit too far; seeing the two have gay together was a bit much. Although Gary Rat was not bad, the best of the three were light stripes. The animation was really good, it had a great intro song, it had a good talent behind it and it was fun as hell! The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to start explaining it! After four to five weeks (if not a little less), the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it got good ratings and it was announced everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go, but several months later I found out new episodes that aired at 1:00. I only got to see one, and even though it was fun as hell, and I was happy to see the show back after all that time, saw something a little away .... At the beginning of it is short run, "Stripperella "had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic and somewhat sexy too. Strippery costumed so well too, the sign was drawn well. After the long break and for the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of the dark and realistic look it originally had, everything was really colorful and comic. Stripperella received the biggest changes, however. Before she usually had long hair, she now had hair larger than Peggy Bundys (married to children) if it was even possible. The eye mask also shows the eyes here now; before it was just white you saw, which was cool as it was more superhero. The upper part of her costume was also a bit of a west-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; As changed to her costume is a bluish-violet color and her upper costume is really cool in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and much over the stupid in advance, but the other half became the more cartoon-like look and yet, nevertheless, ridiculously scary, it became more zany; for example, there was a later episode about a warrior beaver ... yes, a warrior beaver. <br /> <br /> At least, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, "Stripperella" only ran one season, but it was a very good show. Like Tales from the Crypt movie "Bordello of Blood", it can be really campy, but it's really fun. As long as you are not a prude, you find yourself laughing repeatedly on this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: # 1. Paramount released and they have this twisted policy not to include extra on almost all published TV shows, though this was all the show (I would have liked to see some comments maby explain animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2 the amazing Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but the intro song WAS the theme of the show! If you're not going to pay to get something extra at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had some interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic burn that hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee also has a como in an episode. <br /> <br /> The Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: Have a good look at it initially, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (see the show and see some of the things he does) and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. CONS: Mid-series animation change and the dirty DVD described earlier. Apart from the fact that something of humor can be a little stupid at times, I have nothing really negative to say about it. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: Stripperella is a great guilty blame for me and it's just a shame run for a season. It was a very fun, sexy, action-packed cult series that I hope to see at Adult Swim one day with the original intro intact and possibly giving it another season as Family Guy. Check it out yourself if it's on the miserable DVD. You will laugh yourself silly. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Raw and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Runtime: About 25 Minutes Per Episode, Score: 9/10
