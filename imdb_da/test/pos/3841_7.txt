I've seen this movie only once several years ago. But I remember very much like it. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ahead ** An old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. Her butler hears this and suddenly gets rid of cats so he can have wealth. He puts knockout drops in their milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They have to go back to their house before it's too late. With the help of an independent tomcat and other animal accomplices while avoiding the butler and following his plan. <br /> <br /> Could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
