Why would I say that? Because when the film ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be fun. For those of you who think he learned to act after the sixth sense, you need to be very new to his career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky learned to put snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was fun. What sneaks my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claim that there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The waaaambulance? I'm not a loser? Have you ever seen an adult scream, I'm not a loser before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was fun, it was never boring and in a cheesy Disney kind of way it had a point to make. Something to do with life, and of course, any kid's movie trying to do that is in the head, but once I don't care. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it. Do it. You like it.
