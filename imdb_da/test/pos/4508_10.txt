I have read both the book and experienced the film today. The story is so powerful that almost any script or script would have done justice to it. Saw nothing much there. But it's still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel like the book. Seeing it is not like seeing a documentary in a failed state and feeling sympathetic to people suffering from a repressive regime, but is like seeing every other ordinary man's story unfold over generations across continents. Amir's sweep, his guilt, his dilemmas, and finally his choice of a way to redeem could have been a story of any of us. There is not a single infallible character to look up to and forgive, but everyone is gray, just like all of us. Another important observation is that the film does a good job of chanting the lives of the Afghans over the twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. The lively, carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate, ruined remains of the city echo what the Taliban has done with it. <br /> <br /> The child's actors deserve 'thumbs up' all the way. They can put any matured actor in shame. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen the movie or read the book, just go into the theater and remember that you will witness a multi-story story, woven on a multi-colored fabric of human emotion and emotions. This film is not meant to touch anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but to feel the attempt of human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some of the external reviews associated with the site and I have to admit that I do not see the point in writing reviews that summarize the story as a remote viewer and point out technical details about fantastic filmography or something similar. At least for this movie, one should try to connect it rather than judging it objectively.
