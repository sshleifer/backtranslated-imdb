If you set aside Seinfeld, this is the best comedy ever, no doubt! Just fantastic! The "King of Queens" is just finished with its eighth season of homely bliss. Seen in the working town of Queens, New York, the show Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a gracious shipping man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini) follow the daily challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with the daily home reality that reflects our times and allows us to laugh ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through every dilemma they face, whether it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie will also deal with the third high-ranking member of the Heffernan household, Carrie's two-widower Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy with his regular excursions with credible dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug's friends, Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) round off with their "guy" humor and various perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way that evokes "The Honeymooners," THE QINGEN'S KING finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Last season alone, Doug "borrows" Carrie into an involuntary deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner; Heffernans suffers from irritation and financial burden of mold damage on their house; and Doug and Carrie strive to copy a couple whose pictures of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie they accidentally took home. We also noticed that Arthur was jealous of a new dog, which Holly added to his route, and Doug found out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout the series, James exhibits incredible physical comedy, Remini's hard edge and Still's unique comic presence. <br /> <br /> You can't ... You shouldn't miss it!
