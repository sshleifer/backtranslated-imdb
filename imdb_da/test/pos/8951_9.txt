Very nice love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and fun. An undertaker (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to fake her death to escape her husband and village. A scenario of strange situations starts. Almost SAVING GRACE and LONG LIVE DOWN DEVINE.
