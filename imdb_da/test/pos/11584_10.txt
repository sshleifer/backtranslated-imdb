As expected, too many reviews of this movie (from both professionals and amateurs) have focused so much on no more on the film's ideology. That's because The Sea Inside (aka Mar Adentro) is a film about euthanasia. Specifically, it is a true story of a notorious Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who for many years fought for the right to self-help denied the right by the Spanish Constitutional Court, and who - I will not destroy the end of the movie to you . Real Life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with a producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997 and The Other, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical help has been provided in the international debate on this hot button -questions. <br /> <br /> But as I still say (to deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con, about the film's ideology should not affect your rating of the movie. You should not consider the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You must classify the movie as a movie. Perhaps it is a little too idealistic, since neither of us is likely to completely separate our evaluations from our ideological pretensions, but idealistic or not, that is the goal. So forget the philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a film, Amenábar has turned to one of his most elegant and mature works to date. He does not focus on social debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggle. He focuses on Sampedro as a man who lives his days confined to a bed in his brother's home. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in a fantastic performance by Javier Bardem, was a quadriplegic. As the film begins, he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years. This condition was created when Amenábar showed us through wonderfully shot flashbacks in a diving accident - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated the water, deep in, snatched the neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic, he eventually began writing poetry, some of which were published in a book entitled Cartas dede El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); in fact, Sampedro's book was a best seller in Spain. Perhaps Sampedro's artistic work is like a cow, Amenábar has created an elegant poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is set inside Sampedro's bedroom. The focus of these scenes is Bardem's complex and sublime performance. As a quadriplegic, Bardem is limited to moving his head and speech. He has mastered subtle changes in expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted, intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar often have Sampedro growing philosophically in discreet speech, but there is always a combination of evil humor, passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and a sadness and even occasional bitterness not far below the surface. Different underlying emotions sometimes break in as waves on the skin of the sea. <br /> <br /> The people that Sampedro interacts with most often facilitate this in complex ways. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been his chief guardian since Sampedro's accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal insiders against Sampedro's desire to die, and with whom there is an underlying unresolved question (it seems that perhaps José was the only one to save Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who may be the most understanding of him; a right-to-die advocate, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) and thus would be more empathetic and who he fell in love with; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman working on a cannery and moonlights as a DJ who heard about him from the media who would convince him to want to live and who fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the movie consists of those characters that interact with Sampedro in his room. There are also a few other helpers, including Sampedro's father, who remains strangely distant, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to change Sampedro's mind through philosophy / theology (in a scene often wrongly characterized as "comic" - it has an accompanying cartoon element, but the scene is primarily very serious). <br /> <br /> The fact that most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room gives the engineer the couple significant changes in setting greater impact. Sampedro's room has a lovely large window, which he says is pleased with as an observation point on the world. Perhaps more importantly, he regularly envisions the window as a launch pad, through which he flies over the hillsides to the sea, which he always loved, and which has been the most influential force of his life - it delivered when he was younger and took his mobility away. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro, who imagines one of his planes to the sea. It is beautifully shot, with low angles (presumably from a helicopter) in the hills that progress until we follow a stream to the wide open sea, which in this movie represents freedom, the infinite and natural forces. <br /> The second significant change of attitude comes with Sampedro finally going to a wheelchair (he otherwise refused them and said they "mocked his immobility") to get a look in court to help invoke his case . Amenábar gives us an exciting, melancholy travel suggestion shot subjectively by Sampedro, who sees life and the world in action from the car's window. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you agree with the legalization of euthanasia is difficult to deny that this is a well-acted, well-written and well-built film. Don't think it's a ten (and it's even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth looking at as a fine example of artistic, sophisticated filmmaking.
