The Merchant of Four Seasons is a lack of love film. The movie starts with the main character; Hans Epp, who returns from a spelling in the alien legion. He returns to his mother for not being told how much she loves him or how much she has missed him; but being told he is worthless and even worse that she would have preferred the man he took with him to come back instead. It is the character's relationship with women that makes this movie so hateful; That his wife is higher than him is symbolic of his relationship with the other sex; He is consistently humiliated by them and it is through his relationship with them that his life is not as great as it could have been. This is also evident from the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman through a desire for a woman and even his wife; a woman who should love him never shows true love to him. Even at the end, his wife is more bothered by what her and her daughter will do than her husband's condition. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is a thoroughly uncomfortable movie. There is not a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not just that; But the film seems to be happily happy to turn to the misery of the central character. The movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time, it is safe. Despite all the misery, the film never comes out of reality. Any event in this movie can - and probably has - happened and it only serves to make the movie more shocking. The film is of course the hell of Rainer Werner Fassbinder; The cult-German director who committed suicide in 1982. It is only my second taste of man's work, but through only two films it is easy to get an idea of ​​the type of art he creates. Both films are dimmed and gritty - but realistic works of art. His characterization in this film is subtle; We only learn the signs through their situation and not through their character. It is a very smart way to show the audience that it is their environment that defines the people in the film, not the people themselves - and as almost everyone who sees the movie knows what is living in a urban community is like it will not Be difficult for most people to relate to. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is not an easy to forget movie; The film is high on substance and low style, and it gives a very memorable image, and one that anyone who considers himself a biographer should experience. It is with that in my heart that I give this movie my highest recommendations; It is not sweet, and it is not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic depiction of depression, and it is certainly a movie that stays with you.
