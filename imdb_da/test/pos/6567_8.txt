I have read all Junji Ito's English released manga. I watched the movie, and it was a huge steaming pile of turd. THANK YOU Uzumaki is actually entitled to manga. I think those who have read manga will really appreciate this movie more, as many screens and camera angles are exactly like the manga, and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the movie. This movie reminds me of scary indiana. The end differs from the manga that I expected. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend fits in well. Very creepy, I must admit, this movie feels like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. Not really scary at all, but freaky if you get my operation? Another great horror from Japan, get yourself a copy.
