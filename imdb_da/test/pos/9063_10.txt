Many movies try it ambitious. Few succeed. This movie is one of them. Although billed as a black comedy, this expression seems limiting to expressing the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphen Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotions. Quite remarkable, to be sure. Although the comic aspects are certainly present, the film's heart lies in its lead: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy about true love - falls to them, and they achieve it and lead it through the opening scene to the heartbreaking climax and beyond to the warmth of warming. David Krumholtz, in the title role and who tells, anchors the image and does an unusual job. We see the world through Max's eyes, and Krumholtz imbues them with a kind of miracle and hope that one would not expect to be credible that comes from someone who had previously attempted suicide. There should be no doubt that he really achieved leading manhood, earned after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne can be something of a revelation for anyone who has only seen her in less challenging roles. Grace's role is expansive in scope, requiring her to show both great fury and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds of each other. She manages to convince us of Grace's deep-seated desperation, which lies just below her alternating towers and craze. <br /> <br /> This is not a ridiculous kind of comedy, so don't watch the movie expecting strict humor from the beginning to complete. Think more dramatically than comedy. There are some very dark moments that one expects to have committed suicidal issues, and some weird real moments were mostly delivered by Emma Adele Galvin as Max's sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those populated by the countless name actors who support roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer borrow the most surrealistic aspect with their scenes, the other supporting characters that populate the institution where Max and Grace meet, are the right experience. Guillermo Diaz is an unforgettable scene stealing like the terrible frenetic oddball, Hector. Ralf Moeller, as Bruno, acts as his equal man, but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette fully occupies Vera's role with the crapers vitriol from a cursed truck stop waitress. Even her hard-haired character eventually melts, just like anyone who is touched by Max's literally unfounded love for Grace. <br /> <br /> Love to conquer everything that may be the question behind the movie, and even though the realist inside says no, movie is about an escape from reality, even though it's only a few short hours. I recommend watching this movie as an antidote to not only reality but to the cynicism that says a love story like this never happens. Spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does work wonders on the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
