What an original piece of work. I have always enjoyed Liev Schreiber for the "actor", but now one must appreciate the man at a multidimensional level. How did he get that field of sunflowers? Was it computerizing, it looked right. And how do you audition a dog that knows you get that kind of service? Does the academy have a category for animals? I guess what I say is that I really really enjoyed this quirky, offbeat, little indie movie. From the excellent cast (one would never know that Eugene Hutz was not a pro actor) to the filmmaker (some beautiful pictures) the music (bought the CD when you left the theater) and of course the two "D's" (direction and DOG) . All in all, a "10". <br /> <br /> /
