First of all, those who are weak at all must absolutely avoid this film. Even those like me who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies must beware. I'm not telling you to steer clear of the movie, but be aware that what you are seeing is some disruptive material. Definitely not a comfortable movie to watch, but nothing is put on the screen strictly for shock value. But I have to admit that when I watched the movie for a second time, I had to jump to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" came up. The protagonist is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters I can think of, but we begin to better understand humanity of its character later in the second act of the film. In a scene, she cracks broken glass in one of her student's pocket pockets after being unhappy with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and becoming nervous when in front of a live audience. The student goes in her pocket and cries with pain as she stares at her blood-colored hand. Next to the razor blade scene that disturbed me the most. The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she is. When she gets the word that her daughter can't play, she talks about it as if she's also got her hand damaged, being one of the pampered mothers trying to torture her daughter to become a champion. <br /> <br /> Although the film fascinated me and interested me mostly, I felt more necessary to be explained about Isabelle Huppert's character. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and engages in the behavior herself, you will understand the root of the problem. The film states that she desperately wants to be loved. So why the hateful attitude towards everyone? Why does she get sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The action is amazing and I liked the smooth, stylized lighting. All in all, it is not a movie I would recommend if you are in the mood to be entertained, but as I said it is very exciting. And I'm sure if I saw it a couple of times more, I would be able to spot some subtleties that would shed more light on aspects of the movie I didn't make at first. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
