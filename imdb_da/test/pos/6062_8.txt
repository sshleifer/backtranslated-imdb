The 'travel team' is one of the best new Danish TV shows I've seen. <br /> <br /> The series is about the Danish police unit 1 - a beautiful FBI silence that helps solve murder cases throughout the country and the cases they are working on, as well as the influence their jobs have on their personal life, and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a senior policeman. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I started to see this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it has both drama and excitement, I love it.
