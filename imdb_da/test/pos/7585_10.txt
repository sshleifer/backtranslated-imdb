Horses on Mars are a wonderful journey taken by very small creatures. It doesn't have to work hard to keep your attention and the signs are truly memorable. Most of the credit should go to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and to write an interesting story, but credit is also earned by Anuj Majumdar for the story and the amazing music score. Of course, these choices were not an accident. If you can, look at the 35mm range for the most effective effect. It's a beautiful movie!
