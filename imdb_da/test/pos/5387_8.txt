What is your freaking problem? Don't you have anything better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about how to find something in bad taste? Here's an idea: Go outside. That's right: Go outside your mother's basement that you've lived for 13 years and go out. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is on for 30 minutes and I still haven't married this avatar on World of Warcraft!" Oh my God, get inside! Okay, I could have gone overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is okay, but I don't see much more. No matter what, you really should write shit about Mind of Mencia. It's a good show. Maybe you just close your anger because the girl dumped you on World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try to add fiber to your diet.
