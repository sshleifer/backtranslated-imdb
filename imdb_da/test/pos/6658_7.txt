Well, I expected, for all hype and Oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (& something with "the English patient's" size with the same instructor). This movie is not of epic stature, but it turns out I was relieved, it wasn't. It is a love story in the midst of the war gravel, where young men are sent out to fight, desert, and kill, and the women and children at home are left to cope while the men are gone. <br /> <br /> Whatever I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and didn't know much about Jude Law, he was okay too. It seems Rene Z. had the more fun part of the 3 leaders and was able to smartly play a lively, celebrating downhome woman with a lot of aplomb. Also for me it was good to see actress Kathy Baker ... the talent of the other must be recognized / acknowledged. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing this - I can't articulate why really, but maybe because it's a piece of Americana. <br /> <br />
