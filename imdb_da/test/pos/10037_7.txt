This movie is good for entertainment, but it is not historically reliable. If you're looking for a movie and think of yourself 'Oh I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last stand', don't rent 'the dead with their boots on'. But if you want to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older Western movie, with a little romance and just for a good story, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story starts with Custer's (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves their charming personality, which allows him to get away with most. The film follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his struggle in the civil war. The movie ends with its last stand at Little Big Horn. In between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant but supreme George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays the sweet, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their on-screen chemistry made you believe in their romance. The action in general was impressive, especially the comic role (though stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script was sometimes corny, although the movie was still fun to watch. The director's portrayal of Custer was like a hero, and the story shows that this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn to hate him. <br /> <br /> I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 Western movie.
