I love those kind of movies. Blood, Revenge, Much Action, Very Dark, Cheesy and More. But this does not deliver the genre you might expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching them, but why not? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime, and it's not hardcore and doesn't even expect nudity in this movie. At least, some more actions add to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I don't want to destroy the movie or the plot. But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final is a little nerdy. So without further doing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone but I recommend for those people who love decent and well directed anime. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
