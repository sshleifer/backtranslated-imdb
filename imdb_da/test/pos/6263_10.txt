A nice little film about introducing films to China. Prisoners amazed at the film's first audience, largely as it has been described as having been around the world, using actual Lumiere movies for most current events. I do not agree with others about bad action on the British fellow - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese leader really stole the show. In any case, I found myself smiling at my face most of the movie. People who fear subtitles may notice that much of the movie is in English (which for some reason gets subtitles as well as the Chinese on DVD).
