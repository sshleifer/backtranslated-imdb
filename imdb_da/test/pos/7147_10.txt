I really liked this movie of love between two adults in post-war Britain. The high standards of BBC TV are evident in production, and excellent lead players (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this an uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland have previously worked together in theater, and their chemistry and interaction are great. I recommend this version of Shadowlands over the 1993 movie version.
