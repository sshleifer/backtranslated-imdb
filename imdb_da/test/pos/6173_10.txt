A beautiful movie beautifully shot with an eye for the details of the war, and (considering it is set during World War II) minimal violence. A small cast weaves an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation from the loved ones that pilots depart to England (the separation from spaniel will touch hearts), spitfire scenes, love, friendship and fraud. The theme of treason runs deep through the film, from the betrayal of love, to the betrayal of friendship, and finally the treason that the Communist regime refers to former RAF pilots after the war. <br /> <br /> A desperate sad movie, the more because it is so actually correct. I would recommend it to anyone.
