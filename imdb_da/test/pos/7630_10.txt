Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him the Mast Thrust. Male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed communities. Every other day, an apparent role model is forced to tear excuses for a youthful indiscretion, or he gets innocently few kids drunk on his ranch. The last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt for the Mast Thrust, an old, grizzled, big hunter who serves as the top role model. In spite of his chopped traits and pearly nose, females, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him as the Meatloaf is for cheesy texts. Thrust is openly sexist and makes no excuses for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red dress and a private jet with a working fireplace. Thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth, when ironically he is truly the last dinosaur of a rich full life. Despite his tendency to shout at everyone in his presence, his employees and lady friends are immensely loyal to him. He may seem like he's persistently full, but don't make a mistake if he calls you a 'Ding Dong', you're a 'Ding Dong'. <br /> <br /> Not denying his own ballad, Thrust sang shamelessly praising him and his masculinity. A sampling of texts includes: "Few men have ever done what he has done or even dreamed what he has dreamed / few men have even tried what he has tried, most men have failed where he has won / The world holds There is nothing new to him, and things that scare you and me are just a pampering for him / a few men have ever lived, as he has lived or even went where he has gone. "Even BMTG Forbidden Clay Aiken could belt out these texts and become a butt-kicking machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his crew of scientists tie into the 'Polar Drill' with mini-bicycle helmets, although Thrust lends itself to the luxury of the red density around his neck. through the ground and the ice to enter a lagoon. Dinosaurs from the air and the earth soon come down on the scientists, forcing Thrust and the crew to run for their lives. After snatching out a recharging dinosaur, the mast lays back and blows a hearty laugh, not so much to celebrate in the fair but to acknowledge 'the game is okay'. Shortly afterwards, it is a little surprising that we see a few slightly broken over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors. Thrust, not satisfied with just killing a dinosaur, then decides to make it his mission to bag a hollow wide. Through the film, the lonely T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain as a peanut size. Despite its huge size, the local T-Rex is able to sit up next to its victims almost unnoticed. With the surprise element, T-Rex simply crushes a scientist or two and solves the campsite. Every so often, the inflated and cagily confronted Thrust is seen as shouting at someone, shooting at something or flirting with a primitive J-Lo in a male way. Thrust is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only in his dependence to love, but also when it comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in no time. Thrust and the remaining crew members construct a very precise catapult that throws a large rock into the curl of the cunning T-Rex. Having acknowledged that even he, the Mast Thrust, cannot overcome this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to remain in his prehistoric environment. The still-dwindling crew leaves Thrust to live her days with her lovely, although she is a bit gamely, cavewoman and introduces her to her personal collection of STDs. This is just a brief summary of a movie that is so complicated and rich in BMTG tradition that it takes more views to absorb its message and realize that the Thrust Mast is the answer. The press conference, complete with a shouting Thrust, mumbling reporters and the introduction of the great Bunta, is a classic moment. Also look for a body that resembles a dead Ricky Schroeder, who lies on some logs, and the most powerful use of a person is called a 'Ding-Dong' in film history.
