I say remember where and when you saw this show because I think Fox gives Talk Show a chance Spike will be up there with Conan in a few years because he, like Conan, is incredibly fun and seems to be just grateful for to have his own show that adds humor. <br /> <br /> The funniest bit Spike has had so far is The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners, and if you're not tall and get CFS, what does that say about you. <br /> In summary, this show is more fun in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour, so we hope the Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like an extra half hour, more money and a band.
