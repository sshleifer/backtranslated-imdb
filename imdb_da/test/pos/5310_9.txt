Maybe people like to have the devil around more than God. Maybe we like the safety net of a reason; make a mistake only to blame the devil for pain and suffering in the world. There is so much adversity that wastes in the masses that it is difficult not to see the sadness on the face of everything you pass. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows that maybe everything will not be okay, and maybe someone will leave this earth to avoid the pain their lives are waiting for them is a risk he must take for a person he loves. Credit goes to scriptwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge to create a lyrical prose on two suburbs that have crossed paths in good times and bad. Just looking at the cast of almost all A and B list actors shows that the material really resonates with the audience. Feelings need not be worn on one's sleeve to exist. Sometimes everything we want to do will end the suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings an underestimated performance to the table here that includes the acquisition of his character Leland's feelings. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who cuts through the BS of life, knowing what he sees and accepting the worse with the better. The movie is a catharsis for the souls of those afflicted with Leland's horrible event, killing his ex-girlfriends mentally challenged brother. In the confused mind of this teenager he goes into the incident and knowing well what he would do, he would stop the pain he sees everywhere, but most of all on young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake that perhaps playing God is not a job he has been put on earth to do. Whether this is true will soon be discussed as the murder begins an chain of events that ultimately makes sense to many people's lives as they wake up to the tangential fragility of life. This boy has opened his eyes to both grief and rebirth. <br /> <br /> With joking ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk, the movie goes through a journey of small vignettes of two family lives in the wake of tragedy. The plot is fantastic all with special mention to a few. For anyone who plays the naive lug in most movies, Chris Klein actually does well with much the same material here, but also with a development in a man with purpose. His independence is effective when used in the right part, resembling his success in elections, and I'm interested in seeing if directors will allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more significant. Jena Malone has the same effect as well and plays the role of troubled youth as she has in Donnie Darko and Life as a House; Don Cheadle is a stalwart of professionalism that gives us another, taking the compassionate therapist from what he did in manic; and Martin Donovan is brilliant as the grieving father tries to keep his wits together and ultimately realize he must keep his family from falling apart as well. It's also great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When tragedies hit, people band together to get through it all. As Leland clearly points out at a time, one sees men and women helping others out and hugging when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after a few days everything goes back to normal. Cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic view that at least we get a glimpse of people's true nature who wants to help and be good to each other, only to be shot back with the retort "well at least we do during the tragedy." Perhaps we will not think that we are good natured, because it makes us feel that we must be good all the time, and that when it is bad, it must have been like that. By being flawless, we allow ourselves to recover and try again. Leland's mistakes allow him to see the love he had for them close to him, and to open the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones get further away from them. One cannot focus on others' sadness when they first have to address their own. Hoge has made a parable for this and a really effective film production with hopefully many more to come.
