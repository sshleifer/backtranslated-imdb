Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere for not being "exciting"). It is cunning, subtle and a little poetic. (Of course, there is a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Lives" referred to here.) <br /> <br /> But the real point is the ethical dilemmas that tell lies at different levels , as a movie pro. Okay, it's not a "in-your-face" funny title, but then it's not a salutary movie in your face. Please give British movies such a chance. They are trying to get people to think about important things like this: How far are you going to protect your life (even if it's a little messy) against unexpected disaster. Maybe you tell lies. Maybe you ignore your dear lies. It can carry many people out. American films on this theme are abundant, but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms, which are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we are not so "exciting" over here, but we do not expect slogan-like movie titles for movies that are not aimed at a massive audience.
