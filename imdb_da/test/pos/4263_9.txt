Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying race of political filmmakers. The Swedish population should understand that they are trying to uncover the truth when the government and the media actively distort and cover the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is heartbreaking to see how these innocent children have been abused and deaf by the Swedish police and sentenced to prison in political attempts to send text messages and revenge for other actions. The only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it doesn't come to the broad masses in Sweden, as it only appears on theaters and is not released on video or broadcast on television. The political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insights into complex issues and has a role to play as a masseur educator.
