Claudine is a movie that represents the American system at worst. The welfare system was originally created as a step for the families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The film showed a precise depiction of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words, if the father or any male figure is in women's and children's lives, their financial support from the system will be threatened if it is not terminated. The struggle of the poor can be seen all over the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for anyone to rent or buy for their library collection.
