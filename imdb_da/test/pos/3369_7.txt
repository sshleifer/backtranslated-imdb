Even for sci-fi, this movie is a little out there. Okay, more than a little ... My first thought after seeing it was that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans will never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, come over it. Richard Kelly loves to make movies that make you feel stupid not to understand "deeper meaning" the first time you see them. To be honest I had to see the box twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning - (to save you a lot of sociological psycho batteries) People serve themselves, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and not open mail without a return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: Scary old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you press the button, I will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the scary old one gets a case of money. Then the film takes a dive into the unusual. To save your fingers from writing ... To hit the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien creatures, in a comprehensive experiment to exercise the morality of humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked: The film's willingness to ignore the generic movie guidelines. It is different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its philosophy 101 material). It leaves you guessing. Not a Hollywood ending! I did not like: Why would anyone with the technology to impede another way of life devise such a ridiculous scheme? Which god as a stranger has the patience for it? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country's accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 because Kelly didn't pay much attention to details like his other movie. Overall good flick.
