Now, lock me, I LOVED THIS MOVIE, but not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another loved the John Milius epic. It was fun, much more than if it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a big yarn, with a bunch of political correctness. I love this movie for its beautiful photography, its humor and the weakened criticism of the bad boys (Berbers) and REAL Bad Guys, the spear carriers of the acquired 'civilized' world with their repetitive rifles, artillery, and great cannon boats in the harbor. <br /> <br /> The Standout scene is the Berber camp with blue-gray smoke from the cooking fires that enter the chill desert air. It is visually eloquent, highly evocative. Seen in 1904 Morocco, WIND has a helpless American woman (Candace Bergen) who is taken in the thrill of a dashing, albeit dishonest, Berber bandit (Sean Connery-very model of a Scottish Muslim nomad). The exciting story is based on a few historical facts. The photograph is Milius beautiful, characterized by Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and Raisuli perform long-term foreplay and jump around in the desert between oases. Although Raisuli proudly traces his family back to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he also lets her hold her head after she hits him in check! A marine solution storms Bashaw's palace and fires competing hegemons with gasoline. Don't touch the corps, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Despicable Sultan - looks like a scattered ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Greek German officer - a large, bellicose Dachshund with a monocle. He chooses to fight Raisuli with swords instead of giving him Indiana Jones. Noblesse commits, using Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Dashing Marine Officer - kicking the blast out of Bashaw of Tangier's army and storming its palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is mild aphasia. Bashawen asked him not to breathe on him. <br /> <br /> The Berber - a horde of groveling sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac. None of them take baths, except perhaps in camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is exhibited undeservedly as a vacuum and occupied by guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - giving men a lesson in courage, like the two children. She apparently has a large selection of clean, stiff clothes and rarely has a hair out of place. <br /> <br /> Raisuli sends Teddy Roosevelt a message and thanks him for a Remington repeating rifle gift declaring <br /> <br /> "MESTER ROOSEVELT, YOU ARE LION AND AIEE BREAKING WIND." < br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Please take my medical comments to mean I didn't like the movie. I had almost as much fun writing this as seeing Pitcher.
