"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular games of its own lifetime, but it has fallen on hard times during the 20th century because of its unmistakable anti-Semitic content. The game has also been called schizoid in its care from comic scenes to tragic ones, leading to some two players trying to exist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, amazing), but needs to borrow a significant amount of money to wake her. He goes to his once gay lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons) who does not have the funds on his person, but takes a loan from the Jewish unsure Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and insulted that Antonio, who insults him for his religion, now comes to him for money, but he offers it, provided that the penalty for defaulting the loan will be a pound of Antonio's meat. Of course, that's what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock significantly more than the original loan instead of the pound's meat, but Shylock, distraught after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to take it. Portia, in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to put his sympathy, deprives Shylock of what should be his legal, and then strips him of his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally set up as a cartoon-like villain, but modern actors and directors have made him a tragic figure that ranks for the injustice of the 16th century Venice. Al Pacino does an excellent job as Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins' work as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in that respect. However, Joseph Fiennes is more than a bit boring; I have never enjoyed his often overwhelmed acting style. I give "The Merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
