Tempo Di Uccidere (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange movie, but it is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I won't bother with a summary of the plot. Most of what I have read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most of those who wrote them did not understand the film. And you have to understand it to a certain level, even if you cannot describe what it is really about. This movie is strange in an "Once Upon a Time in America" ​​way - only shorter. Many Hollywood stars (whatever it means ...) have played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is known that many players who are past their prime or slowly rise to do so here. Cage was not yet a real star when this was made. I'm not a fan of him. He is very good in some roles (raising Arizona, spreading the dead) and weak when playing the hero. I don't really know what to think of him in this one, but he probably does not reproduce the typical hero. This movie could have done without him, but the fact that he star may be the only reason why he has ever made it to DVD. <br /> <br /> The support molding is good. None of them look fake, and they act as if they were really there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I've seen 3 movies by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he's one of the greatest directors of this time. Unfortunately, no one knows him. This film was his last for a long time (a break of 19 years). I think this movie might have failed in the office, but from the way it is done, I think for Montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is great. It's always enough. The dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a major role. It all feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music of Ennio Morricone is very good. It is not a piece that you want to whistle when you are in the shower, but it certainly works well. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, feels and sounds right. It does not serve the experience of it on a golden plate, but it can be the biggest difference between Hollywood and the euro cinema around. It may sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for action; Avoid this! If you are looking for a well-established Apocalypse Now in a different time and setting, but with a slightly similar journey to a "state of mind" (sorry if it sounds corny, but I don't know what else to call it) just like this one very much.
