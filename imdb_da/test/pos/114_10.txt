I admire Deepa Mehta, and this film is a masterpiece. I'd recommend buying this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to see more than just once. And believe me, you'll still find small meaningful details once you've seen it several times. The people - except for the grandmother's perhaps - are all very balanced, not black and white. Even if you follow the story from the perspective of the two main characters, there is also empathy for the other characters. I think the IMDb rating for the movie is too low - probably because of its politically controversial content.
