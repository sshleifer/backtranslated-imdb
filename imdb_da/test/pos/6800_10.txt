In my opinion, the National Velvet is one of the best family classics at all times. It has Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). Velvet wins a race horse called (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it right away. Using Mi, an ex-jockey, they train it to race in Grand National's. After the jockey who was scheduled to run Pie back at the last minute, Mi Velvet convinces to take a seat. <br /> <br /> This was a well-composed movie picture. Nice story and top notch acting. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture expert by Clarence Brown. The photography is amazing. This is a movie you will enjoy in the years to come. <br /> <br /> This picture is what made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close to the movie. They still send postcards to each other after all these many years. <br /> <br /> A side message. Elizabeth loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.
