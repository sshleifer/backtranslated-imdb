The 2005 edition of Royal Rumble came from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two championships in WWE were defended. The undertaker fought for Heidenreich in a hat-fight. Shawn Michaels took Edge in an angry match that was built up last October, and of course every man over himself was rope Royal Rumble matched himself. Who would take the prize this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of players. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who fetched the popular victory in the main event battle, but not without controversy, or should I say, a botched finish. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista would dump the young Smackdown! star over the top rope, but it all went wrong and they both went to the floor. The judges acted on their feet as we had a gun competition similar to Bret Hart and Lex Luger back in 1994. This led to the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac went down to the ring the way he only could but wounded himself hard to get into the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting, his legs out and telling the two men to restart the fight. Batista then had to make the first round and dump Cena to the floor and seal his own future with a Championship match at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> Underneath this year, Royal Rumble had a very solid line up, with many of WWE's biggest stars competing in matches. Each brand had two big matches each. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the night with the fight between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical competition. Back and fourth until Edge fell. This was a smart booking decision and held Edge as a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The second match of the night was the sweeping Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The fight was not a classic, but then again they have been classic Casket matches? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane knocked out the coffin for a good pop. The undertaker surprised no one when he got the victory, slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre sweep. The first of the two championship matches at night was John Bradshaw Layfield's defense of the WWE Championship in a triple threat battle against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again, not a classic but entertaining nonetheless. JBL won the victory after spinning Kurt Angle. His party was short-lived, but when backstage Teddy Long informed him of No Way Out, he would defend the WWE Championship in a blocked steel box battle against the Big Show. Not a very good way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch of course reigning World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. His rematch from Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was much better than the original meeting. It's a shame because they just don't seem to click too well in the ring, and it would be an excellent sweep if they did. Orton played the concussion role very well and went down to defeat to The Game. <br /> <br /> So the first big of 2005 was a good one. It reached its goals. Feuds ended and new began. We were now officially on our way to WrestleMania 21.
