National Velvet (1944) The movie that put Taylor on the map. Costarring the then number one box office champ, Mickey Rooney. Taylor plays a girl in love with the horse and when jockey Mickey Rooney can't run in the Grand National Race, Liz cuts down her hair, pretends to be a boy and runs the horse ... well, I won't spoil you. It's quality melodrama that MGM was famous for putting out. And it's another early color image to start!
