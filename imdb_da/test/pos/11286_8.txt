The begotten is definitely an experience and an exercise of it. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. A lot of what is happening on the screen is incredibly difficult to make. Your sight is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in color and tone, signs in the road and random cuts to heaven. The sound is very joking and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that throws this movie. <br /> <br /> As for what Begotten is about, the "rape of the environment and rebirth" feels the theory right to me. But I didn't spend much time focusing on the meaning, it's almost insignificant. Obviously, the director did not want to explain anything. He just presents it as it is and if you want to search for a meaning that is up to you. <br /> <br /> Seeing the Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I was jailed from the opening. It's really like looking at someone's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes disturbing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dream-like beauty in there. If you are an art house / experimental fan and you have not yet seen the Begotten, make it a priority. I doubt you will ever forget it. I know I don't want to.
