I first saw this movie by accident when they showed it on TV and I was up late ... I really closed out there. It's really incredible; from the location (as isolated as it is possible to be on this planet, it made the "abyss" like ET in the council pool) through the interesting characters (Keith David is particularly good as the reactionary children - "what if we" are wrong on him? "-" Then we are wrong. ") and the effects (more yucky than Alien). Moreover, the real excitement and fear in the movie has nothing to do with the effects. These are the people you start to fear; knowing one of them can - or maybe not - "all they seem to be." It certainly has the feeling of "who goes there?" <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing; up isolation, fear and gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really cuts in. Even more than "But then again who does it?" Bladerunner's punchline.
