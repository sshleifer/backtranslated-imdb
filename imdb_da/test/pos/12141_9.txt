Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that does not attempt to create style. That's why it has style. Because the movie is so underplayed and so important, it becomes more and more involved. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we are emotionally invested in this taciturn, hard killer who loves his wife and children, has a meeting with customs on the coast near Nice at night, which neither he nor we expect, and who shows up just as willing to shoot a policeman or traitor with so little sense of throwing a bit of ribbon. We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two little boys, one in 9 and one 4. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absence", we are told. "On the run for years he had seen his resources down, even though his anxiety kept him on the move. When the Italian police closed every day, France was again his best bet. Perhaps he had been forgotten." <br /> <br /> Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. It was several years ago. A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he is hiding with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. He and his children need to come from Nice to Paris, but the police are in search of him and they have set up roadblocks. For Davo's two best friends, the time has passed and they have gone further. They do not want to put themselves in danger and for what? Commitment may provide caution. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to gather Davos and the kids in an ambulance, then drive to Paris with Davo's strong bandage and the kids hid. We are on a journey where Davo's opportunities are more and more limited, where he has to find ways to get his children where he discovers that there are no more ties of friendship where fraud seems likely and where his is Eric Stark . <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without worrying about it. There are no trench coats with pulled collars that are not foggy with the melodrama of the gangster code, so many French instructors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who was sometime someone who now slides down to be no one and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the movie, but when paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a curious chemistry takes place. Ventura as Davos is angry and worried about looking after his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a hard man who looks to kill someone if necessary as part of the business he is in. Belmondo as the young thief who was originally sent to be a consumable driver and to be a friend to count on, gives The brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star force as a major role - broken nose, under-tongue jaw - shines straight out of the screen. He makes Erik a fight for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes her girl friend, exude charm and good-natured sex appeal. The ending is bittersweet fate and without a stylistic attitude in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel is gone. There's nothing left." It would be worth seeing Classe tous Risques to learn what he means. <br /> <br /> There are many fine French gangster movies. I would place this right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventasa's best performances, see Army of Shadows.
