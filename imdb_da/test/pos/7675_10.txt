The many comments from others have been very informative and I participate in their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, 1959 film. <br /> <br /> In my early teens I entered a record company and this album was one of the free ones I chose to participate in. I knew some of the voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent so I'm confused as to why it's available in Europe by CBS Records, Inc, when I haven't been successful in local stores. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never saw the movie but for years I have been calling for local video stores to get it. Now I know why it has never been available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to others who claim the heirs of property rights and agree to release it, but they imperfectly perceive it - The beauty of music and history reached so many of us who would never have had the other experience. <br /> <br /> Trudy
