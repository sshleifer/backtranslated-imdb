This was a very gritty movie about anti-Semitism. But unlike the GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has been old and does not seem to be heavy-handed. In other words, it is about the subject without any apparent sermon or pace with today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the most wild characters when he hits a guy to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> I give a movie crap for his gritty and incomplete look at hate. It is in many ways an example of Film Noir - although the subject is not about the usual gangsters or robbery.
