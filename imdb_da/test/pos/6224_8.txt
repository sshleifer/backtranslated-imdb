I suppose it depends on when you actually see the movie for the first time that their impressions are formed as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it as a child on television back in 1973 when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it. Such was the time when the space program for the moon was a reality, as shows like "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only saw shows once and that was when the network sent them. The only way people could slash your shows was to make their own parody of it; They couldn't take your show and add their own comments to it. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this "pilot" concept was. I watched the movie and hoped Stryker would come home; did not know that it was possible to continue beyond two hours. <br /> <br /> Then I would understand what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I can't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really to understand the story, one should not look it from their perspective, but rather from what is of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If you look like American, it may be humorous about the lack of security in a police state ..... but if you are a subject in that state then compliance can be expected and security can be less. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to the extreme, perfect, not to suspect, then it is unlikely to ask so quickly when things are out of order. </p> <p> The film is interesting as the old man who remembers the time before but sees his words when he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state appreciates knowledge to some extent because they are careful about how they control or destroy their brain power. These days you will probably know what the movie is about before they see it, so much of the excitement is lost to surprise. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one believes that this movie was done well in the Cold War and the greatest fear of the astronaut is that he has crashed in the Soviet Union. You come a long way into the film before it becomes clear that such an opportunity is the least of his concerns. This is the primary difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered timeless as any comments about the Soviet Union are relatively small and lost early in the film. In the previous, these links are throughout the film, probably directly at the beginning and then as a theme variation for departments. All that said, despite my dear memory for the movie, it's pretty easy to see that it wouldn't have done it as a series. Every week Stryker wanted to make friends, Benedict would hunt, Stryker would get away. Eventually Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would pick up the hunt. A debris would develop. There may be a jab on something new, which maybe another crew member from Strike's mission shows up, but it probably wouldn't be enough to keep the show going. <br /> <br /> If you go into the blades that others have used to slash the movie, odds are they will cut it too. But if one remembers that this was made during the Cold War, and what fear and discretion on the other side were at that time, of what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they can find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it.
