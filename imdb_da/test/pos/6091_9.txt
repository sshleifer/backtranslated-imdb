as it can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions between. I think this is a good sign. <br /> <br /> I have always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I have never seen titanic and will not). The English patient grips because it shows how people can be different when in an exotic environment as opposed to when they are 'at home' (Katherine), it shows how devastating love can be slow, strong, and utterly painful. excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the backward one (s), where meaningless one can feel further. <br /> <br /> Photography is just amazing, not to mention the actors play. The pace is slow, but timely, and it does right to the book, the timeline and the depth / development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multilayer in this film. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies ... as if they are in a hurry to get to work .. hi - get a life! ;-) enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
