Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A beautiful high school student is marked for unsustainable terror in this thrill filled for television films. Gail Osborne is new to the city. She makes friends, has a girlfriend and everything seems to be on the way. It's until she gets a vicious and scary phone call while you are in a babysitter. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. Throughout most of the film she tries to find evidence that the person raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extras: No extras from Goodtime's home video. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This excitement filled for television movies was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty crazy. This can be a bit boring, but if you are patient, the end is pretty good.
