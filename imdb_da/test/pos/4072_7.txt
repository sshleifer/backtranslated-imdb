This is a fun movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feeling it could lead to a sequel, but I doubt it will make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some fun and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun looking at working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Clean Russo-Well, she's just fun to watch anyway, and she's played her part excellently. <br /> <br /> Some game and unusual stunts, especially the rubbish bin scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the big draws at the end. Don't be at the start of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
