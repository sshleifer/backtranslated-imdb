How to sum it up! There were others who said Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral at that time ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit of a blast from the past. It reminds you of the old movies (from the 50s and 60s), and it's not just because it plays in that period (1955 to be precise, with the Flashback exception), but it's the mood the movie is made i and it shows on the screen! The main actor here (who has been told very popular in his home country of France) is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with number 117 attached to him. There is a character that sums him up in the movie by asking whether he is good or not ... you will see when you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Very fun, this is what and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair, but don't take themselves or anything else for that matter seriously than you need to look at this! : O)
