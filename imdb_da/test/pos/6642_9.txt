I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I did not know exactly what to expect, and in the first ten minutes I might not fear enjoying this movie. It began very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was less exciting, as the sound was rather poor and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I certainly do not regret having gone further seeing it. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically so compelling. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen actors so wonderful with such intensity on their faces: Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable, and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always psychological violence in Bergman movies and this can be most physically violent for all of them. The strained relationship between man and woman develops in parallel with the physical violence surrounding them ... Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
