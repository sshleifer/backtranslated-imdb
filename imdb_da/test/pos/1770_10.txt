The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda wonderful and passionate. Luciano Pavarotti also sings great. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the girl, Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most compelling actress in this difficult to beat ensemble of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in Contessa. All principles are well-known and world-renowned. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it on both laser disk and dvd. You should also have it!
