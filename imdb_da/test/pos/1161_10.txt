I like the wind and the lion a lot. It was a good movie. I thought that since I was young and it was made so long ago, I didn't like it so well, but after I saw it, I was amazed at how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco were treated in the early 1900s, by the Germans, the French and even the Americans. If I was a high school teacher, I would definitely show it to my students, from a high school's point of view. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves. My little 3 year old cousins ​​even sit down and watch it. <br /> <br /> Systemoffel
