I do not know why people considered it unclear or uncomfortable; It's not like American Pie or anything. I do not know why people are offended by the universal connectors; As it is part of the plot, the advertisement is sorry. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with good dialogue, good subtle joke, good story, good morals (which luckily doesn't get too juicy) The great achievement here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy ( Muniz) so much that no one believes in him when the wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and run Ulven's crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz may be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He perfectly manages his distinctive self-confidence and what seems to be lacking at first sight is truly a perfect nonchalantness. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What more can I say? The girl has the gift. She is fun, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I'll soon come to California.) In fact, the best friend was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the creators saw Amanda's interest. Which works fine, as that part would have been rather boring without the blessing of Byn's abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some wanted to play Marty Wolf as evil and devilish, Giamatti made him - not just a jerk, but it was a real smoker, a jerk who lives up on the screen, rather than deliberately suppressing it. And I doubt that many other actors could pull the psychological breakdown that Wolf also goes through. <br /> <br /> All in all, great movie. Loved watching Jaleel White be able to suck herself. Loved seeing all the little references and such built-in movie. (One of the guests in the party scene is the director, Shawn Levy, another is Bynes former co-star Kenan Thompson) Loved to see Amanda in these outfits ........ Get the DVD if you can. It has all kinds of great extra things, and the lovely Mrs Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
