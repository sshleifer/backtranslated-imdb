During the weekend I saw the movie Tipping the Velvet, and if I had to score this movie out of 100, I would have to give it 100 no questioning. I am a true believer in true love, and this film moves me in many different ways, and the actors fit the parts without a doul. But I have to say that the end wasn't that big, because I didn't see sparkle in Nancy's eyes when she looked out at Flos's eyes when the eyes kicked every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty had to just be in the room or in Nancy thinking and Nancy would just glow from that spark. Kitty told Nancy that she couldn't find her and that she was looking for her but couldn't find her. Kitty was ready to do everything to get Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes you could see Kitty's pain. I think Nancy should have let Kitty see that their love is true and strong and that she would not let her go so easily. You have to do a lot of two and get the two to do it together, but don't let others play the roles, it must be the real Kitty & Nancy, or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is just not genuine. I'm not fooled I know we all have a true love out somewhere just waiting for each of us and I believe in my life that Nancy true love really is only Kitty and Kitty true love is only Nancy. Come on, let's play the game the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost her all by losing Nancy. And Kitty should not be the only one to blame. I am gay myself and being gay is not easy !! WAKE UP!!! In 1889 I would not be gay, Kitty was lost deep inside himself and in 1889 it was perhaps the right thing to do, to be married to a man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to stand up for her, Nancy should fight for her. I even remember how deeply I loved this girl, and I let her get away because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to get rid of her, and I will pay for the rest of my days, because like Kitty I couldn't find her anywhere. I heard that she is married to a man in the United States. I even heard that he beat her. In the end, I think we both lose. Give the two girls another chance. Life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Kristen Ann
