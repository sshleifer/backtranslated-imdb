It is quite a success that three stories, which are occupied by three very different filmmakers, could be so obvious about homosexual and bi-sexual relationships, and their struggle! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" is about the inconvenience of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an elderly man and a younger one. A story of experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> "A friend of Dorothy" portrays a common dilemma that many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their lives: the intense attraction to one who is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story really left me feeling moved! "Disco Years" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused with their sexual orientation, but is also afraid of being exposed as something other than just! A very empowering story for those of us who have experienced fraud in the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy for others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bisexual, or seeking. Each story is uplifting in its own unique way!
