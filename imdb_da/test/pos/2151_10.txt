I was lucky enough to have seen this movie at it's Seattle Film Fest screening, and was blown away by how big it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back on life and times, music and relationships with one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with Gershwin, Cole Porter as well as all the other good songwriters of 20th century standards. He was considered a peer by all four members of the Beatles, who all called him a 5th Beatle and a similar wavelength to themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to tour, so many today cannot remember him, and those born after his thriving time are unaware of who he was. This is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction to finally give the man his guilt. Unfortunately, the film does not yet have wide distribution, or even a DVD, so luckily luck in seeing it. <br /> <br /> If you are a person with the power to put together a DVD distribution deal, please contact film makers. This movie must be available. Hi VH-1, what about screening it on air, so maybe put it on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
