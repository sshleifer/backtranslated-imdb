Looking back at Jim Henson's works years after his death is like taking a look back to another time. Because unlike most so-called creative types trying to sell to, or worse yet cynically exploiting, children today, Jim never really seemed to forget how it was to be a child. And if there was ever a moment in which he demonstrated this, Labyrinth is aside, this is 1979's Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story of how Henson came to work in the children's television as a puppet trainer and ended up with a half-hour show on his own on primetime television, The Muppet Movie concludes a confirmation of everything more progressively, types of understanding will say to children who did not fully meet the expected norm in the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era where we are gagged and bound to talk about something so that no one can be offended, the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed much of The Muppet Show is offered here. I've said it in other comments, but I have to say this. A big light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died. Muppet Movie begins with its throwing seat to see the premiere of what was to be seen in the next 80 minutes. In short, precise strokes are introduced to the big players as well as some of the minors. And when the story starts right, we are a good song to bring us into the moment. Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad picture of what Muppets, especially Kermit, was. These were not just a bunch of blanket dolls with unique personalities that combined to put on a show. They were living things based on a part of us all, writing only so much more boldly than we are used to. When each Muppet was introduced to us again, we saw another reflection of a part of ourselves, and of course the children in the audience would react differently to each character. That's why everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared after a drum kit and tried to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine. Today I am more of a Swedish cook fan, but what hey. <br /> <br /> In addition to the characters, there were a number of musical figures that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can you see it? shared an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as Henson's creative soul. But the most relevant song to me was Gonzo's number, asking what he is and where he came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime staring into the stars and, as Gonzo said, we knew we would go back there one day. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they have decided to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If any evidence is required that today's "musicians" have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something that listens, this number will be. Never before, and never again, would the group's dynamics in a cast and the music complement each other perfectly. With puppeteers and voice actors so perfect on their game, the human cast had a lot to live up to. <br /> <br /> It makes it even more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the agreement. Cameos pepper literally the movie, where everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas pops in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man you would expect to see in a movie about Muppets, seems to create a fun moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as worrying to me as an adult as it was when I was a little boy, but I suppose that's because Henson knew why I would find it disruptive now. However, the great impact strength comes from Charles Durning, who, like Doc Hopper, includes everything that both Henson and his audience have decided to resist. At each intersection, Hopper will either offer Kermit the chance to sell and betray his own kind. Or maybe that stop is the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's compliance are gradually becoming more powerful and violent. It is a great metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also shows to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cozy does not make them any less of a friend. In fact, Animal shows himself to be the best friend Kermit has in that moment. And it has been the core message for every good show or movie that Henson has been involved with since then. Shifting or dismissing others due to linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake ever made. There can be no doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple dress can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still are not under serious investigation from the child protection authorities, Henson's creation workshop has never been out of the ground. To misquote the album's title, it is bold to be stupid one thing, but enforcing the choice on others is another issue. Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside the gloomy box. There will never be another hero like him, but he will never have us stop trying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten movies. If we were to send a movie into the cosmos to prove to the intelligent life that we are worth more than being wiped out, it would be.
