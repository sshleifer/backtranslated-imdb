The premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of rat race; want to find the simple life .... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children in tow. The lake is beautiful, they have rented an old house .... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how to do it. Gerald McRaney is excellent, a well-known face for lifelong viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this movie was made in '88, perhaps the author should produce a sequel! <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as the city's eccentric, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern lookalike / bile soldier. <br /> <br /> While the story plot is a little over the top; if you are a movie, you will be reminded of similar scenarios from "" Psycho ""; "" Deliverance ""; and other horror stories of that genre. More camera images and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy; If you do not take it too seriously, it is very entertaining; and better than, for example, the latest movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80s!
