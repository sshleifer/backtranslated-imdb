During the production of this film, I once received a statement about television. Something like, "Is the Kitten gang going on with Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So my understanding of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When I recently watched this movie in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it wasn't hard to see this. I probably haven't experienced this way of interpreting the movie ever since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories, the lack of empathy leads to disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The crematorium shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who have to say goodbye to them. In the crematorium of death and fire, it is almost like a cheerful game to him. Death and fire's seriousness are not underlined by the father and his boy accordingly, in ignorance pushing a button leading to the disaster that seriously injures his father. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: The importance of showing the young enough feelings. As they grow up, they need to know what behaviors lead to disaster and what feelings are beneficial. <br /> <br /> 2. The wizard moves his wife as an invisible puppeteer. Just as she thinks she's starting to cut the strings for the master's hand, he comes up with personality, integrity, and joy, pulling hard and she's left in desolation and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son has been trying to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste as opposed to his parents' "bad" taste. The real problem he carries within is far from understandable to him: His father's behavior passes on as he stifles his own wife in his immaculate environment. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: Suppression raises bondage. <br /> <br /> 3. The father who was abused as a child passes sadism towards his children when he cheats on their inheritance. He deprives them of their childhood and eventually even their inheritance. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: When no love given you can not give anyone. <br /> <br /> 4. The fathers are abusing his daughter creating in her a ruthless advocate of sadistic aggression. Here, the ice cold Nazi religion becomes very evident in physical violence. It provides a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation for the actions of young "scin-head" nuns' behavior when they suppress others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can Nazi feed in a pervert home? <br /> <br /> Can the horrible consequence of ignoring family empathy in the long run be that there is room for sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a movie contain so much. It reveals little by little as I meditate on it. I consider it excellent "painted" and the actors are amazing. Especially the lovely look played by Ulf Brunnberg turns out to be the worst of all ..
