I got Monster Man in a box of three movies, where I mainly wanted the other two, but still had a very comfortable time with it. It mixes horror and comedy to a reasonable effect, greatly helped by Eric Jungman's decent performances as the geeky leader Justin Urich as his friend and Aimee Brooks as the interest of love. The movie is pretty predictable and my ideas come from a whole host of other movies, but remains fun all the way with some great gruesome gore. It may not measure up to the classic gory comedies, but it still does fine. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two scary scenes, such as in the bathroom or bar. The movie can be seen all the time if it is a bit suddenly plotted and written and for me it only lost a bit at the end, as Monster Man in the title begins to look like a member of Slipknot, and the movie is trying to go more horrific, but it is not It's not twisted or convincing enough. The last moments are also weak. Nevertheless, despite the lack of great excitement and general sadness, it is a good example of unpretentious, often gnarly splatter comedy that should end up being fans of the same.
