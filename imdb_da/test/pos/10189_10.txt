I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mother, her best friend, and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just kids, but when you see quality exhibits like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that Disney's magic is for everyone! It was such a good show that we left the theater and returned and came again. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I want to encourage anyone going to Disney World to check out this show, which is not just a show, but a world-wind, fun-filled Donald ride, once again letting his mood get him into trouble!
