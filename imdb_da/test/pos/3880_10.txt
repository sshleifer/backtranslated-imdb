I thought it was brilliant! It was good to see the presenter tracking each of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in appearance, nor did Dirk Benedict, he still looked crazy! I thought Mr T looked thinner, but it was still good to see how he looked after this time. I thought it took some to track down the other cast members, like the one playing Decker and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T couldn't do the actual reunion. It was also a great shame that George Peppard was dead, so there was a hole to say. I just want now that I had lost it to keep it. Let's hope they repeat it again.
