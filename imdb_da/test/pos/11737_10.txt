Cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good movie and script.The manuscript management and action was also good. The flow of the movie is a bit manipulative to make the audience tear through the excellent love of music and circumstance that works, but later on the movie makes you feel raped in a way. Jones makes her character very memorable and lovable. A deeper story could have reaaly taken this movie to a higher level but still deliver the movie to its genre. for hopeless romanticists, great love story fans, big soap drama fans, 50 are Cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the leading actors .....
