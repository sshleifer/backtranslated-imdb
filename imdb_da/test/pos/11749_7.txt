"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" is set in Hong Kong in 1949-50 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist and Han Suyin, a half Chinese half-European doctor. This story of a mixed race love affair was a very bold theme for the fifties, and most often Hollywood tried to soften the wind by throwing a white actress like the supposedly non-Caucasian woman who fell in love with a white man, something that would be considered as politically incorrect today, but it was perfectly acceptable then. (For example, think of the cast of Ava Gardner in "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story"). In a British colony, perhaps, was a way to explore racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superior waives for her to date a white man whom she is unable to marry because his foreign wife will not give him a divorce. As was the case, European colonialism was made into the whip for some of America's own faults. Imagine the furore that would have been released if a similar movie was made about a black or mixed race female doctor at a Alabama hospital. In addition to racial issues, the film also raises issues of international politics, referring to both the Communist seizure of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in fact, she used to support Mao's communist regime, but here she is shown as a solid anti-communist. However, this is not primarily a "problem" movie about either racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known at the time as a "woman's image". However, such films were mainly aimed at female audiences, although they were mainly made by male directors. They treated love and romance - often unhappy romance - from the woman's point of view and had a strong female character in the lead. The genre often delivered roles to actors older than the heroes of standard romances. Previous examples were usually in black and white, but in the fifties they generally used a lush, sumptuous color here. Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role of Jennifer Jones, doing a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden, like Mark, quite uncharismatic, but that doesn't matter much as Suyin is very dominant. She is much more than Mark, and the film explores her family and professional life much more than it does. Although Jennifer was still beautifully beautiful, in the mid-thirties, she was rather older than most romantic movie heroines during this period. Holden was of the same age, unusual in the 50s, when "boy-meets-girl" often meant "older man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not very deep but is well made with some attractive photography, especially by Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing tendency of the 50s to shoot on the spot rather than on studio sets. Rarely can Hong Kong have looked so beautiful; The view from a hill overlooking the city has a special significance as it is here that Suyin and Mark go to their romantic tasks. The overall mood is one of exciting, doomed romance, a mood enhanced by atmospheric photography and musical score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 10.7
