This is really a movie you have to watch twice. When I first saw this movie, I was really attracted to the story. While most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories taken by Buddy (Nick Drake, Wonderful Allusion) and Daphne Del take you outside their room and into their world. Through their conversations, you get a sense of loneliness and pain that each one feels. The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly, dark, lo-fi and exciting. When you watch the movie the second time around you, you can download all the tracks you missed the first time, leading up to one of the best ending I've seen for a long time. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it becomes more accessible. Great movie, you won't be disappointed.
