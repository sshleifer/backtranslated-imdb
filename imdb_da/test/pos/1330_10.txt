With a roll like this, I knew the play would be great. Nonetheless, I was cautious, as I am always followers. Would it maintain the feeling of the first movie? Could they possibly replicate the excitement and excitement of the mastery of Ocean's 11? We never know because they didn't try. At least not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a bright and really fun parody of the hoist genre. If you want a gripping, logical hoist, don't see this. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogue, quirky characters and a totally brilliant scene where Julia Roberts will imitate herself, then you will love Ocean 12.
