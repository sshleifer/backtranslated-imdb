If there is a good exciting movie, this is one of them. James Stewart puts a dazzling performance as an American Dr. Ben McKenna, who with his wife and son is in Africa on tour. They stumble on a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Attach your seat belts", Dr. McKenna too much out of a murder attempt and is trying to stop it. But others know that he can be dangerous (dangerous to them) and try to dispose of him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hank, the son, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting movies, this is the one you should see. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
