I loved this movie! So worth the long term. I need help at the end though .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Marie's final shot at the end - Is it here to suggest she's still looking for Renaud? or maybe she was the one who wanted to revive those 13? (she seemed to be the one who sent Colin's first book in the first place) I don't really understand, but I know I really liked it. So if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it, please do so at the end. <br /> <br /> Thanks
