I loved this movie! It was adorably touching and fun. Finally, here is a story of a group of people who face some challenges, flounder a little, and then decide to be themselves and end with joy; when was the last time you saw it in a movie? To deal with floating life, love and sexuality, the signs face real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations like men's group camping trip and the explicit realatory liaisons) and manage to learn and grow without the movie being sermon, dark desperately, or too unrealistic. You will love and care about the characters that are far from hollow stereotypes, depicting real people with just a touch of truth behind their wild labels. <br /> <br /> A good romcom for a Saturday afternoon and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily, and no one is forced to be something they don't want to be. Far better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a great choice if you are tired of watching gay movies that have a little painful lesson and bitter lesson. Or maybe you just like a good British bowl? James Purefoy looks like always, and Tom Hollander is fun. So go ahead, see, enjoy; you will not regret it!
