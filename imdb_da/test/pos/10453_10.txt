Spoilers in this review! In spite of a couple of very unlikely scenes, including the boys of PE who measure their penis in a competition and the few compulsory teens trying to get vignettes, this film captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teens have ever finished . It accomplishes this by not only showing the friend's trio, Gary, Dave, Rick, smoking, drinking, ever prowl teens, but also living on the nature of the friendship itself, since these three friends have tested their loyalty. This movie is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romantic Gary, when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time, he immediately falls in love. The awakening feeling in Gary is written great on the screen, and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is scolded by her lover. This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence, as the bindings with his two best friends will be tested and broken during the story. The confident lady man Rick is the person in high school, we all secretly want us to be: beautiful, cool and always have the impossible beautiful girls in a sponge. Rick turns out to be a cad, but one must remember that his character is only 17 years old. He is panicking and making a bad decision. From Rick's perspective, the story is also about finding one girl in her dreams, a bad collapse, and then finally uniting. The look of Rick's face as Gary enters and sees Karen kissing Rick shows that he finally understands his best friend and he loves the same woman. As in real life, you do not bend out because your friend has a pristine love. This is the film's tragedy. Rick is not a villain, and all the time through the film, he reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. The soulful quality of Gary's performance, however, is the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place, and he is consumed by love for Karen. Nevertheless, Karen is ultimately not moved by Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who go in without giving back who exist in an independent vacuum and never stop to realize the emotional injuries and trauma they inflict on others. This movie is brutal in its statements of love and friendship, but that is what makes it unique among teenage films. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes a hopeless romantic film, albeit a doomed tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found the dream girl and does not win her will understand. The heartbreaking crushes in high school are just as real as the emotional strains of adulthood, and this movie reminds you of daring strokes. Gary's last turn, which he drives away with the inscribed locks, is just as exciting a moment in cinema. One feels, after seeing this, that it really is made of two films. The first part is a silly teen sexploitation movie, and when history begins, it is a heavily influenced drama. A great movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars, including police, cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
