This movie was one, if not the best movie I've seen in the past year, I highly recommend it, it starts out as a very funny movie, but as the film progresses much more. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I saw a screener of this movie, but I'm going to buy it not only for myself but for several true movie fans, I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie will be widely unrecognized, as is the case with so many other non-commercial movies, it is a comedic yet heart wrenching movie it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think about it when it is over and is it not what a good movie is!
