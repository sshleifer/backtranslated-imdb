I actually went to see this movie with low expectations as it was the only one to fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar scheme and always try to refer to the average vulgar people, especially trying to make jokes out of the continuing curse. But let's see, the language used in this movie is not very exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak. The story and pacings are brilliant and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world. The action was amazing, and the manuscript is one of the best ever produced in Colombian soil. I think anyone around the globe can get a good one and a half hours of entertainment, with a beautifully-managed bluff black humor comedy. It reminded me of movies like snatch and others of that kind. I highly recommend it and hope it can be seen by more people as Colombian films seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.
