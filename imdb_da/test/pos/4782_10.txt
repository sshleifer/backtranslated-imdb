While in a country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined forces to create benchmarks for short subjects, cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney, and his partner Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most prominent of the early synchronized audio characters (It was revealed that this was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the more successful and fun of Mickey Mouse shorts (still in silent movies - the only sounds are small Irish and Mickey and animal beeps). It also goes pretty fast for its less than ten minute maturity. But in those minutes you get the immediate sense of how much fun Disney has with his characters, and how the new-found use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools. There is no story to talk about, just random things that happen and occur because of Mickey (bug, Steamboat Willie) on this boat on a river. And as the better Mickey Mouse shorts, his lack of speech seems to be an advantage. It's a must-see if you haven't seen it as a child, but if you do, it can still be a good choice.
