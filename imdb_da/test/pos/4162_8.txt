Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of the films that long in the mind for years. It was Respiro (see comments and synopsis here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, with the amazing young talents he had on the screen for the first time, he takes the audience in a dark vacuum. A literal leap in dangerous waters. The topic is migration. In this case, from Italy to New World (the name of the movie). A great thing that calls it his American release "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest - it's their life for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate to spoil the show that tells the story so I will be a little bit into Crialese's work and his whole team made it so great. <br /> <br /> First of all, I choose to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. That means the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the reality are always mixed with the smell, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as vibrant as it is in reality. <br /> <br /> The bent metal and abrasive sinks, the infamous drone of the wind and the vicious sounds of large engines and ship's horn are among the points that make this movie so involved. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier The light of the symbol is present from the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot from Respiro) and permeates the entire movie with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. The subdued tones and the very gray and gloomy portrayals of people suffering from the cramped and dirty boat they sail to hope are fascinating. <br /> <br /> Light is used sparingly, almost to discover all the signs in the dark. The beauty of each shot and each scene is accentuated by the costumes of the period and the perfectly selected physical characteristics of the actors. Again, as usual, Vincenzo Amato is definitely alone. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is half-hearted. I suppose she never reached the perfection she reached in Cement Garden and in her very first movie: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's just that she seems a little awkward in her role. <br /> <br /> The locations and sets are hard and convincing and they play almost a sign alone. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable character is played by Filippo Pucillo, the stupid, younger son. The contrast here with its first role is complete. Then he played a supercharger child who was as relentless as anything around him. Now his character is all expressions. And just that: no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of the movies that are not very well received in the United States. It is absolutely Italian in all. It is so Italian that most of the time, language is one of the many dialects that are much older than Italian itself. In the US, this movie may be a bit too much for the Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the States will see these films with awe. <br /> <br /> And again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to the air. All in all, another great and very well-written story from this filmmaker is that only this year (2006) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the Golden Lion. Not a little deed!
