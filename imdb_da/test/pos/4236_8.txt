I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a 'return to grandeur', but the series was never really good. Very good # 1 was, # 2-3 was throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle / tagline: "Chucky Gets Lucky." Then he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager'. Tilly did not just create a presence; She added much needed humor, back story, drama, excitement and a great little sidekick / game thing to Chucky. And as much as I liked her in the function, she can't get all the credit: the props (see the first 1-2 minutes for horror tribute), the letter, inside jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines were great ( "In fact, if (this) was a movie, it would take 3-4 successors just to do it justice"). Mercifully, Chucky and the series have given up on the Andy "Hide Soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He joins with his ex (Tilly) who he transfers to a "Bride" doll and a pair of Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really Heigl?) To recover this pendant buried with Chucky's human body. This is the case for any Chucky fan, the 80s slasher-horror fans or even those who have never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' movies. It's fun, dark, harmless, crooked ?? but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minute screen time, it's always good to see her. After all, you barely see her playing poker anymore. (Side note: of course I downloaded at Superman reference ?? Hackensack, NJ.)
