This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol member who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is amazing, and the battle scenes stand together with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further proof check out "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good that before I saw "The Shepherd," I thought Van Damme might not look very credible in defeating him on the screen. Van Damme keeps himself though and although he is not quite as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick with the best of them. All combat scenes in this movie are very well done, and the gunfights are also above average for this type of movie. The only negative I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Dammes character motifs should have been presented earlier in the film, especially as to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does it is very cool, but you don't find out at the very end. There are a few other things that are never really explained, but it is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie, and it's not character development. Overall, this is a solid action movie that I recommend. Then run for the Damme border!
