I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it caught me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enchanted in Orry and Madenline's love story. I'm a hopeless romantic, so it really made me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wished he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in three books I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand it because they had some time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books together and I can't stop seeing them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes the fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline personally! It was a wonderful movie and cast!
