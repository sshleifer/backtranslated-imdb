Great acting is best rewarded by mating with a melodramatic script that truly raises the human spirit. For all the minions that need every day, take heart! Your patience is good. Your indulgence and decency will prove in ways you will never foresee. This is your great story. I do not believe that you can look through to the end without a moisture in the hardened eye. Or can you? For me it wouldn't be that way ... the story is relentless! The idealistic, denied his guilt. Will anyone speak up? Ah! but you should see the show yourself! observe the headmaster of his prime, without notice and the peerage observer would certainly expect. And why does he continue? Yes! you have to look at O'Toole's performance for you! I can only wish that it was still 'in print' to buy, so present to my friends as my proof of respect for their faithful life.
