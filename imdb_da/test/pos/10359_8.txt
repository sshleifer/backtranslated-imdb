This is a slightly uneven entry with a standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang that reminds in the dinner that once - thirty years earlier - was their hide; a ho-hum duologist between two aging rock musos; a noirish kidnap turned upside down and an opening order (plus epilogue) involving hoist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current 'hot' property Anna Magloulis, which has its moments. No movie where Jean Rochefort pops up can be rejected easily, and here he shines as one of the quintessential cant. The movie is only worth watching for Rochefort alone, but each of the sequences has something to offer and it is definitely worth a visit.
