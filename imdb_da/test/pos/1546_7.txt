Newly released on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than one fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been, this is the kitchen sink by its dirty. Terrance Stamp is great in it, the music is cute, Carol White is very trustworthy as a single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals. My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend working in the pub with her (the one with the huge beehive coming down over an eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men passing by. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scared this was the appalling act of Carol's first man, but if you can get past that, you're okay. And Donovan gives some of the most dull, soft, bittersweet texts to get out of the 60s.
