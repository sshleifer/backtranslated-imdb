*** May contain Spoilers *** OK, it wasn't as good as expected, actually it was very different from what I had thought it would be, but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> I don't care too much for that kind of music, but in this movie it worked perfectly (I mean duh, he's a rock star), yet I loved Stuart Townsend in this and Aaliyah even though she had a small part of the movie was amazing. Although Tom Cruise played Lestat in the interview with a Vampire, I must admit that I am happy that he played the role, even though I usually hate when using different people to play the same characters in similar successors and things. Overall, the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it, even though there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
