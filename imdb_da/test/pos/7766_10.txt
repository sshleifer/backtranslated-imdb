I try to be diverse in my movie watching. I can get into "Pride and Prejudice" just as easily as I get into "vanishing acts". Love Jones is my all time favorite, it's the standard that I judge any Modern Urban Romantic Comedy. The shot well, the shot of Nia and Darius running up Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle, is one of classic 3-second movie shoots from time to time. Of course you will never remember it. When it came out, I would be a new paradigm for modern urban filmmaking, good actors, no weapons, and so on. The film industry has disappointed me to some extent, you will get your occasional Drumline or Roll Bounce or Tyler Perry's "Why did I get married". So when I see "my people" presented on the screen in a very professional and stylish way, I jump in Love Jones. There are no best movies ever made, for many people and opinions for it. But that's my personal best. My favorite line from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come up and talk !!"
