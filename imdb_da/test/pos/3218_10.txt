This is definitely an excellent show. I didn't have a cable so I started to rent them because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teenage soap, you know who dates who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It's also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you see it. It's a comedy drama that is rare when it's well done. It's about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it is a story of the best friendship - about a mother and a daughter. The characters are the perfect cast and everyone does a great job. It is definitely the best TV show I have a lot of across.
