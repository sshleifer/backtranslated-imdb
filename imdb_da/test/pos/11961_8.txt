Affable aspiring cartoon Hoops McCann (a wonderful engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the delicious deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after graduating from high school. Hoops, George and several new found friends come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who is family home threatened with demolition of the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilarious and boring nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and silly but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectious inane vitality for what is impossible to either dislike or resist. In addition, the lively and enthusiastic play from a fine game casting adds immensely to the glorious splendor: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his bouncy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as an evil rich ass Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the average Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the retrieving cookie, Joe Flaherty as Gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as the cranky Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the alley preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak who holking the biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's slick cinematography, hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerio's cool rockin score and the funky animation are all equally outstanding. Simple funniest scene: Eggs in a Godzilla dress that terrorizes a lovely dinner party. An absolute hoot.
