So this on Sundance one of the first years I participated in the festival - blew me away ... It went way too fast and I have never been able to find it again. I figured it would show up at a gathering somewhere, but still no joy. My memory is foggy on the details - I just remember being surprised again and again and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this has some leads? Online, DVD, beat-up VHS copy - I would try to do it at a good price ... Over the years I have probably seen over 200 short films (used to live near Aspen where they have an incredible shorts party in April ). This is clearly one of my favorites and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Many thanks to everyone with managers on how to see it :)
