Christopher Nolan's direct debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and helps country contracts to make 'Memento' and completely correct. <br /> <br /> The following is an exquisite example of how to make movies. No fancy effects or drops of blood ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to catch us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknown to me and I assume most people, did a good job making the characters live. They were all trustworthy and that is all they need to be. The movie is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot, but it is very rewarding in the end. The film is a little short to be a full length feature, but any extra length would have destroyed the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would have been reduced. Although the short film has all aspects that make a movie attractive (IMO): an exciting beginning, an exciting and a surprising end. <br /> <br /> I dare say: The following is almost as good as Memento, his best movie by far. The encrypted chronology is equally masterfully used in both films, the amazing plot phrases are present, and the play is very good. This movie was made with only $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) million dollar box-office hits. The use of b & w can be a hard pill to swallow the big crowd. The following is primarily Nolan, who shows his skills to the study leaders :-). And what skills they are ... rarely have I had as much as writing as much as in 'Following'. Even Pi does not even come close to the IMO, although it is also very good. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that certainly should not be missed by any self-respecting filmmaker. If you liked Memento, 'Following' is definitely for you.
