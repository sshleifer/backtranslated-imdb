Kinks warned about media heroes. Outside the films, most heroes are also "ordinary people". Society requires some role play, but what happens when it extends to parent-child relationship? Are some parents trying to improve through their children, rather than the other way around? How do you give a role model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates swimming; a brilliant musician who doesn't want to play. Rude, funny (despite the depiction of "serious" problems), very good multidimensional action by everyone. Lots of plot twists complement the emotional excitement. Celluloid heroes never feel any pain. I can't ever remember being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver movie (I also liked "The Village"!).
