When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: How did I use my summer vacation". I thought it was laughing on the floor. A few years later my friend had the video. And I figured I'd see it for the good old days. I was still laughing on the floors. My opinion, Plucky and Hampton's shit is the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the sketches are fun. I'm still looking for the video. So if anyone has any tips. Please write me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
