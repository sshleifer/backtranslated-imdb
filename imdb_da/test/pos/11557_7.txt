At times I really wonder? When I look at the comments here, it seems that most people have seen a completely different movie than I have. I just saw it ... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy, but in the way of having seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The movie needs some patience, yes. And yes, the protagonist is really annoying, but I'm sure that is on purpose. Maybe it really makes a difference if you see this movie in a movie theater or at home. Most people watch movies at home as they listen to elevator music. This film certainly does not fit into background noise. <br /> <br /> No. Good control does not mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good governance means following your topic and keeping the story and the actors together. And while it doesn't seem perfect, at least I think it seems pretty good. <br /> <br /> I like the photography and the sets, though sometimes they are passionate about the surreal. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked the actor ?? Guillaume Depardieu does NOT play Pierre. He acts as a Pierre, who himself plays a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero he is trying to be so hard to be, he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot, a righteous weak man who occasionally harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for the truth is simply a position is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lie and not even even asking questions or explaining himself. People wonder where this or the person came from and other things: No sign seen for more than two scenes is inexplicable, there is enough information scattered throughout the movie at all. <br /> <br /> And even the weird building begins to make sense as soon as the target exercise is seen: Remember that Isabelle escaped from a war zone - and that is, of course, a refuge for warriors in a civil war, probably Bosnia (who still was when the film was produced). It is at least what is suggested by history. Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and at the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with her father on the cover, which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.
