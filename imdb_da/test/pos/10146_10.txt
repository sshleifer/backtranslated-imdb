Some people say the pace of this movie is a bit slow, but how is it different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very consciously and, as a point, have ghosts of tension and brilliant assembly injected through it. This film just gives us the right amount of comic relief, which makes the tension scenes seem more exciting. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema found in Hitchcock's collection (the best is probably almost all "back window"). Clean Cinema for Hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film that fit together without dialogue to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the image. <br /> <br /> Not many slip-ups by Hitchcock here, and the play is amazing especially by Doris Day in a rather surprisingly serious role.
