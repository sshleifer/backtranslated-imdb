I gave 9 out of 10 points. I sat in tears almost the whole movie because I had to laugh! The story was of course not excellent, but it was not boring either. Erkan & Stefan are assigned bodyguards to the beautiful Nina. While doing this job, they come between the "front line" of BND and the CIA. Of course, the two are neither born guards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster to another; and they do it in a fun way that when you see some scenes you will not be able to stop the tears! As actors, the two "stupid grinning" characters do pretty well, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think the two hero's speech is curiosity or "pseudo-foreign"? Well, if you hear many Turkish-German people in Munich who speak exactly like them, you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And maybe in 10 years it might have been the youth's joint speech. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
