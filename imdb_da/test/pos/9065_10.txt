I really loved this original manuscript and the various places it took me, emotionally, spiritually, and just stupid things. I was not caught in the "credibility" of the manuscript or actors and did not even think about it before reading the reviews here in IMDb for the movie. Listen to Michael Parness talk on the question of his idea of ​​the movie, who wants to see how crazy people, or "f'ed" up people, as he said, falling in love is really interesting. I identified with not having a story book romance and liked to see dysfunction at its best. I like to see David Krumholtz in everything he does and has been following his career for a few years now. I think this is some of his best work and tell someone just watch this movie to see a fantastic young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz really was a scene stealing and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in engagement. I laugh and cry both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival. I question why it didn't happen. I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative Indie movies deserve an audience. Technically in this movie is it really beautifully done ?? The colors are amazing, and finally, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for a while.
