Just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, full of tensions made from wonderful wild nature shoots, where few young people meet their deaths in the form of two crazy, fat bastards who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director who, unfortunately, is undervalued. He achieved building excitement, not with gore, but with showing threatening natural environment. Lieberman succeeds in building a tension in a very linear, simplified way, which is also the best way not to show the viewer goreen, but to let him imagine the worst that happens with the characters. <br /> <br /> Just before Dawn was always compared to Texas chainsaw massacre, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It's as good looking as Deliverance, better than Hills, I mean scary and better crafted, and it's incredible like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last few decades who finally lives on DVD!
