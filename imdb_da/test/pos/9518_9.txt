This is another gem of the Daniele Thompson pen - in fact the same year (1999), she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three author / director credits so far. Belle Maman is first and foremost 'French' as ​​it means, which of course are different things to different peoples. The principle is simple: On the altar, where he married Mathilde Seigner, the groom, Vincent Lindon, gets his first glimpse of his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers from what the French call a coup de foudre, which we know as love at first sight . In theory, the story is either 1) over right then and there, provided he called the wedding off or else 2) just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is solved in one way or another. Thompson jumps toward # 2 but not without hitting us with the weird subplot along the way, such as Deneuve's cigar-carrying lesbian mother Line Renaud (in fact, if anyone cares, Renaud is in a long-term relationship with Stephane Audran who co-stars here) and throws in a brilliant look in a luxuriously decorated men's room at the wedding reception, which is in a fun song and dance. Consummate writer that she is Thompson, also derives the comedy with drama as the brilliant climactic scene where Vincent finally spits his feelings to Deneuve at a family reunion while destroying the collection. This is one to taste. Repeatedly.
