It is clear that the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this is done quite well. <br /> <br /> It's cleverly sweet and dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child. It also makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments on how hot she is in this video. Of course there is some Burton influence here, but I don't want to say that this Brad is trying to tear him away. <br /> <br /> He just jumps in and adds his talents to a genre that I appreciate. I like what he does & he does well, nuff said!
