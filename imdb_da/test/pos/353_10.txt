The Mario series is back, and in my opinion better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative Mario yet; even more than super Mario 64. the controls are good; some of the best for the Wii. beautiful graphic design too. the levels are very large and the good old bosses are back. there are tons to explore in this game; absolutely a high level of playback value. I have only 2 complaints: 1: The story is a bit like Mario 64 and 2: The difficulty is not very high; although it requires a little patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. Casual Gamers: This game is more than worth buying. 9.8 out of 10.
