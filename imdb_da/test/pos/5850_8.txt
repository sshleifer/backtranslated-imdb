This multi-leveled thriller kept my attention all the way through. It is disturbing and informative to see how pervert human behavior can be. It is also instructive which previous wounds can motivate the current behavior. Nobody, save Sandra Bullock's partner, is very sympathetic. But everyone is trustworthy. Sandra did an excellent job. Her character, Cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defense. She is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. I really enjoyed this movie.
