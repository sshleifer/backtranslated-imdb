I didn't know what to expect when I decided to see this documentary. I knew it was about a former Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In fact, I didn't expect too much. Oh, what a surprise! The story of this person's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this movie apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story itself. Diets are very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story of his life growing up in Germany during World War II and adversity. We are there with him in the same small town when he describes his family, inspirations and struggles. We follow him to America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. Then Dieter describes his story of catching, escape and survival in the Lao jungle. We are again with him in the very jungle, when he describes and reintroduces his prison and road to freedom with great detail. We see the same primitive cabins, villagers, and forms of detention he treated that really haven't changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, mountain terrain and rivers Dieter face during his escape. It helps us understand his feelings, pain and suffering. I enjoyed the man, the story and the style. Job well done!
