I saw this because a friend told me it was wrong and I watched a video so I was really watching it. I saw it, and the enemy, the battle scenes are really good. If the boys can't fight like that in real life, they surely fooled me. There are not as many matches as I want, I have to say, but the games that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can say it's violent and cool. But there is also the plot that goes around a love triangle between the protagonists, although it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fighting. He is the head of his school, and is Hea-wons rival, who heads his own school - a bit of a playboy, hot-headed and a rich boy. Then there is Han-kyung, a girl who doesn't care much for her - the father has just gone away and she moved back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend - and then she meets Hea-won who goes to her school and Tae sung who calls her "nuna" (older sister). Eventually she discovers Tae-sung is her brother, the fruit of one of her father's affairs, and he loves her despite their blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls for her and takes her as her boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who recognizes her love for her. All in all, it's a wonderful movie, but if I was really depressed at the end, and I just couldn't help thinking, Damn, all Korean movies I see about battle / death / depressing things / incest ?? Because it was certainly the case with Old Boy and Wolves Temptation. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.
