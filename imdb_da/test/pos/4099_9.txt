Really, this movie has to be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I thought was a studio movie and I was totally happy !!! It was on my movie list to own alone because of the cast. Three of my COMMON, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both have been to Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. Excuse the bad spelling, was in there, so I thought only that for the small amount I spent it would be fine. Boy I was right. I'm not going to give any of this away, but you might already know the story anyway, but I'm just saying if you can get yourself a copy in any format ... Do it! @ You will not be sorry. JPC
