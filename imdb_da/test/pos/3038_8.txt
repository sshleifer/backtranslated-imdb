This movie is a while when it was made ..... Realistic. Film was not candy coated in the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy end would create agitation in the audience, which hopefully would encourage them to act. It was at least the way it seemed at that time. In today's movie world, this movie is unlikely to be made. There would certainly not be this end, but realistic. The sad fact is that the film depicted a situation that could not be improved without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.
