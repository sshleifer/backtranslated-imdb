A man named Joseph Samuels was found brutally murdered in his apartment. It seems that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening, and with one of them apparently missing, the evidence certainly proves the missing soldier. But when the detective Finlay digs deeper into the case, he finds that they could bark the wrong tree, and that this crime is about something desperate sad and silly, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Born out of the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton, Crossfire directed by the sharp outstanding Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire {originaly named Cradle Of Fear}, is a tight and poignant image daring tackles anti-Semitism. Tho decision makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source, the story is about homosexual hatred, as opposed to anti-Semitism. What is still due to RKO supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott is a kind of insidious discomfort dripping with Noirish style. The game features three Bobs, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with Noir's beloved Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. The only third billed, it's Robert Rysy's image all the way, his portrayal of bullying, conniving Montgomery is out of the top and perfectly shows the talent he had in abundance. Ryan had good reason to give Montgomery some of his best work, for he had earned in Marine with Richard Brooks himself, both men had discussed the possibility that if the short story were to be made into a movie, Ryan wanted to play and play Montgomery Thus, the rise of Ryan's career as a reed was born! Gloria Grahame also puts a wonderful and heartfelt tour, which is even more remarkable as she plagued her violent man at that time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent to her and his constant presence around the set sparked others in, but Grahame, who probably channeled real-life feelings, became Ginny's character and shone very brightly. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young also come out with flying colors to really seal the deal on what a smartly traded Crossfire image really is. <br /> <br /> Tho Crossfire was released before the second anti-Semitic picture of 1947, the Gentleman's Agreement, and shaved for over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, some of its thunder being stolen by the Fox Studio's Award Award. Nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actress {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Manuscript, won nothing, but critics of the time welcomed it as an excellent shift in American cinema and today it stands tall , proud and dark as a bold and excellent job. 8.5 / 10
