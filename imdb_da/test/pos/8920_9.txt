My friend made me sit down and watch this movie. This is out there material. "God the Devil, Heaven Hell ... And a restaurant thrown well." <br /> <br /> Four guys and one dot. Who dies? When and how? It's the story. You will never guess the End to this. An accomplished little gem of the Aussie cinema. Hats off to the team that made this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
