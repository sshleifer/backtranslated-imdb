This episode introduces us to the formal dress uniforms worn by Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Lieutenant Tasha Yar. The basis of this episode is 2 groups of separate foreigners, The Anticans and Selae, who try to catch and eat each other in each turn. The two sides really have each other and it's up to Riker and Tasha to keep them out of trouble. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a mysterious spacial anomaly goes around the ship, which wounds and kills some of the crew members. But at the end of the episode, this same spatial anomaly holds a valuable member of the audience. Will they be able to save him so they may continue with their ongoing mission of space research? <br /> <br /> Note: This episode marks the second appearance of Irish actor Colm Meaney on TNG after "Encounter at Farpoint." He portrays one of Tasha's "yellow-shirted" security guards.
