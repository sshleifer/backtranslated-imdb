This is another of Robert Altman's underestimated films (let's be honest, the only movie he made that didn't really work was ready for use), and Sandy Dennis gives it a spellbinding. She is far better here than she was in "The Out of Towners". The material I want to admit is under the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but it hardly matters. As long as they are allowed to do their thing and do well, almost every story will do.
