For anyone having problems with naughty, evil or cumbersome children, this is an important program to see. It's just the best behavioral documentary, not just for tips but for the transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, with fifteen years of cumbersome experience, she now has a program where she shows a family where the children abuse very, very badly. Frost is the nanny who does not let the children win. Every episode has the young children who are crazy and very, very naughty, for example. throw things, constantly swear, beat relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences. But every episode at the end of the show transforms the children of the parents (with the help of Frost) from small monsters to lovable children. It's just amazing when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is an excellent Supernanny. It was nominated National Television Award for most popular factual program (twice). It was number 15 at The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very Good!
