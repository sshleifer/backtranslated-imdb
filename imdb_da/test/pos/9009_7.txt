Spin-offs, for anyone who does not know, are usually not successful because most of the original characters are absent. Here they are and you could not ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon, not meant to do anything but entertain. <br /> <br /> JP Manoux, replacing David Spade, does an admirable job of preserving Kuzco's ego and yet does not seem as annoying as Spade's character (a character Spade has been doing for decades and comes on one's nerves after a piece time). He has a softer voice, but it fits in some way. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, reprising her part as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not really received many awards since she became Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps for her evil part in Boomerang. It's fun how much the character looks like her, though. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There is no way that he can not be fun except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black 2. I have been a fan of his side Seinfeld, but unlike that character he plays a true equal guy who is craving to Don't do so nice things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful as all Disney is usually, but sometimes the design is a bit too sugar-coated. Oh yes. Two out of three are not bad.
