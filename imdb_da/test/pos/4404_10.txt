Thank goodness for Coen Brothers. Their success has given them greater budgets, but they have not freed them from their creativity. I had planned to watch another movie but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. When it started, I forgot what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is fun, but they don't make cheap jokes just to make fun. The scripture is brilliant and comes with great skill by George Clooney (after that no one can say he is just a beautiful face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated at many levels, whether or not you remember Odyssey. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this wise. I have seen others, I would describe as beautiful, exciting, fun and charming, all of which also describe "Oh brother", but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes, where all the subspecies finally came together. You can feel that their journey builds up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It is surprising and binds all the loose ends neatly without carrying the story out.
