Ok, the other reviewers have largely covered the main points of this great little gem, ie. The story started in life as a material for Buster Keaton's silent classic "7 Chances". Comedy, or appearing in any genre for so much, merely interprets a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it is not an entirely original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially making material written and executed by another, and yet for a low budget, short time of a movie, they handle things just fine. No matter what the credits say on their movie, by real "stooge-philes" that they had much input on lines and directions. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon makes a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka even during a documentary about the boys. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy of something as simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are there today who can claim such a master? Most obviously manned Seinfeld but no one else I've seen in the last 35 years watching TV. Critics always want to "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but then again ... who remembers the names of critics or what they said? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
