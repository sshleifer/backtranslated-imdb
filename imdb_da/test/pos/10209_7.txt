It was hard to believe this was directed by Fritz Lang as he mostly ran criminal dramas and mysteries. This movie features a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays a crime that tries to go straight and leave his old gang and win by saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to get telegraph to the west. Jagger hires many men to make sure it's done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is responsible for the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. Scott meets with his old gang who will stop them, but Scott can't tell anyone. It is quite a good western and long should of some more westerners.
