I'm new to games, but I would have started much faster if this movie had existed! I caught it at Gen Con last year (a trip made only as a service to my husband) and LOVED it! Even for a non-gamer like me at that time, it's fun and accessible - so much so that I finally relented and started sitting on my husband's game group. <br /> <br /> I will not give away some plot details, but if you are a gamer you need to watch this movie - and if you are not, you will have a good time despite yourself. There are probably "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the movie is available to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: Want it longer and want it to be available on DVD. Soon maybe?
