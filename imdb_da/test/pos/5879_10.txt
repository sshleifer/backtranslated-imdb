I was blown away when I saw "the best years of our lives". The actor, script and master William Wyler's Direction (winner of Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. The film is about three World War veterans, who come home together on a plane and all live randomly in the same city. They are all reunited with their families. The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar's winning role) must adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and Children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are different than before he left the war. <br /> <br /> Another man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) must find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much harder adaptation to make. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent Oscar role) He has lost his hands in the war and has to handle his family and fianc√© 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) responses to the hooks he has in place of his hands. All these men and their families are reunited in the film in various respects. The stories of these men are all interwoven together beautifully. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of Best Picture in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I would give "The Best Years of Our Lives" a 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie renting this one, you won't regret it.
