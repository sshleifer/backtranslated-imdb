For estonians, Finland sometimes seems like a country with dreams. A country where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies has made this brilliant piece that shows that everything is not so good in Finland too. That Finland can be like Paha Maa (The Bad Land) than any other country. It shows that people who can be as miserable in their lives as we are in any other place. It is sometimes not good. This film shows nicely why Finland is one of the top suicidal countries. It is not easy to live in the north. Cold climate changes us. I have become more and more attracted to Finnish films and this one is very good. The action is also good. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the Finnish Finnish stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that can come after the movie! 8.10
