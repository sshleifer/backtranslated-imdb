"Subconscious cruelty" must be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" did not disturb me so much, but there is a strange psychological element to "Subconscious Cruelty". This movie invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surreal images, and one of the most disturbing movie results and sound designs. Repulsive at times; Yes, but its visual flair is comparable to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of the 4 directors and cast the graphic violence of a movie by Luico Fulci, and you may be guessing what you are in. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into 4 parts. The first part "Ovarian Eye" is real card. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a naked woman gets her stomach cut and an eye is pulled out. The second part "Human Larvae" is a bit like the movie "Eraserhead", but with incest. It deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where's Frued when you need him? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and Jame's Broughton's 1972 short film "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. Men blowing bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbating with tree branches. The branches blew when they were broken. Look in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's sheath. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing and sometimes it borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the movie made me think of Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I have never been more disturbed in my life knowing what I experienced. A businessman gets his private persons pulled from fishing hooks. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on a Christ figure and continue to cannibalistly eat him as a bedside and sodomize him with a tree branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that if I ever see the movie again, I have close eyes or a bit fast forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are of course very talented. To think they did this project in the early 20s. Hussein continued to control Tarkovsky's influenced "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better film, and he co-writes the Nacho Cerdas script after dark horror masterpiece "The Abandoned". "Subconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images coming from the unthinkable world of everyday human mind. Well, sort of.
