When I first saw Stella at the comedy center, I thought "God, it's terrible!" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do, but search for the Stella shorts that I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only, my dildo expectations met, but I probably found the biggest comedy scenes I've seen this year. The set of twenty odd short films puts me on the edge of my seat with water running down on my legs. Not only did I laugh my ass from the first time I saw them, but continued to laugh harder when I saw them again and again. It's really a shame Comedy Central had the restrictions on cable television for the Stella series. It would have faired much better on HBO or Showtime. Their humorous brand cannot be limited by censors or popular culture. Given even though it was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would have voted it canceled for a season or less, but it would still have been fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all are individual members. Any Stella fan should check out David Wain's site with all his short films. They are as fun as Stella herself. So my hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they've made with Stella. I hope to see much more of the squad in the future.
