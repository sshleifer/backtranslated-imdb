"One minute to pray, another to die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting story. It's filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a movie in this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does a great job showing Clay McCord, a crime that is suffering from increasingly disruptive attacks. He seeks amnesty before his enemies enter into him, but becomes too cowardly for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan delivers the best performance in the movie as Governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also here. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it doesn't stand out for me as one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. It lacks too much in style to be in the same league as any of the big ones. It has some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it's a little too much like an American western. This is especially evident in the music score, which is OK, as movies go generally, but rather boring with Euro-Western standards. Soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from "The Unforgiven." Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a little too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, this would be the perfect compromise. All this is not to say that anyone should avoid this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. As I said, it is a very nice movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, spaghetti or any other way.
