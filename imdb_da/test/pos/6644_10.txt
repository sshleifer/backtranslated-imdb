A horrible watch, but one of Bergman's finest movies. Interesting to compare this with Wolf's Time, as both have the same main actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken the sanctuary on an island. In the former film, it is basically inner demons that lead to von Sydow's disruptive personality (at least that's how I read it), while here are many circumstances beyond his control. There is much written about the unsympathetic central figures, especially von Sydow. For me, a good (if flawless) man flashes early in the movie, but one who complains hard against adversity. The deficiencies are all that is left when his humanity is gradually eroded by a horror after another. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this I saw A Passion (Ullmann and von Sydow on their island) and was amazed to recognize many of the same places. And then there is a dream sequence ...
