I love this movie and every aspect of it, well-directed as a comedy and as a drama. The action is huge, done by an all-star cast that plays the high society of New York perfectly. The scenery is incredible, absolutely breathtaking. I also love the story: a successful NYC architect who goes through a midlife crisis, leaves his cheating wife and runs out to a Greek island to hide with his daughter who chooses to go with him. <br /> <br /> I just can't express my love affair enough for this movie. "Show me the magic".
