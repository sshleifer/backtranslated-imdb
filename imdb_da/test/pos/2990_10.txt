I watched the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on this ... I went many times to see it again and again ... I think 9 times in all. Just amazing is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the soundtrack, the beautiful panoramas of the South of France, the lifestyle that the children began on their own. An ideal way of living is what they had created ... of course the powers to be made, but when I forget that part, I find myself in the movie and live like that! So good that it is available on DVD now ... it wasn't for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
