Excellent storytelling and filmography. Exciting, biting social comment. <br /> <br /> Superb effects. Well-behaved and acted. <br /> <br /> The parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) sometimes draws too much (about 3 hours) and disturbing the flow of history. I first read the book as a child and enjoyed the parts of the giants and the little people - but the book lost me when it came to the floating island and the land of "yahoos"! Well, even though the fairy tale plot may sound like a children's story, it is actually a very adult story, full of symbolism of the moral decay in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, author of the novel on which the film is based.
