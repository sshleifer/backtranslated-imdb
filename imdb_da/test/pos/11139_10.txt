Good work! Was very exciting and had great stunts. A show that really rocked. Was a good job by anyone working on this; and especially the action on Bobbie Phillips' part. It would have been good on the big screen. Would like to see more of these movies in the week or maybe a weekly series. This was great entertainment and am glad I saw! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll look for the next one.
