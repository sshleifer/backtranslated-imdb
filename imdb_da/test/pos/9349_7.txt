I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the biggest scifi flip I've seen, but it's not a bad movie. The action is good and the characters are more "real" than most in low budget sci. (At least it's not full of stupid bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she cares about single mom and someone and better than anyone. <br /> <br /> Don't let the nay sayers run away. See it yourself and rate it yourself.
