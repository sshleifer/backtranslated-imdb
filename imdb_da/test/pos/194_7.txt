It is not difficult, after seeing this movie, to see why post-silent Soviet cinemas are kept in such a slightly critical respect. Don't make me wrong. The cranes flying are at least in the first half very entertaining and have an ease that is completely unexpected from the country of origin; a fresh, lively, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as the original charm; two amazing subjective sets-pieces; and a romantic enlistment who flirts with, but never completely walks into, the Lelouch area. It's just that in its subsuming of great social, national and international events to a love affair, it's essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a Soviet Union that emphasized the state above all, and at a time (World War II) that suppressed individualism and freedom to maintain murderous symbolism, this justification of two appealing young lovers is a relief . And the thematic similarities - all consuming love renting one another at war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEMMEL, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also add to its potential love. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a strong medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, performs a soft relationship at night, their only leisure time. Boris's cousin Mark, a composer, also has eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris secretly volunteers for his family and the fate of love. He promises to write to Veronika, but it never does, thinking maybe she didn't bother him to see him, or maybe the post is simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves into Boris's family and helps out at the hospital, where his father tends to be wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Concerned with Boris's silence, Veronika is also accused of the attention of Mark who has been exempted from military duty by bribing a local official. She eventually gets worn down and marries her to accept her adopted family. Boris has meanwhile been killed in action. Veronika, disgusted by herself and an incredible Mark, refuses to believe this and awaits his return and promotes a young orphan name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love, symbolically perhaps of its transcendent, epiphanic power. But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V-formation, and this form permeates the entire film through geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exterior groups, groups of people, composition, camera angles, hero's name - or by editing where feet going southwest In a story meet of feet going southeast in another. <br /> <br /> This serves to trap the lovers who have no control over their destiny and also propose the Stalinist power never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the couple seems to be free in space, whether literally in an unprotected environment or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironic, minimized, torn apart - by circumstances, families, crowds (see brilliant, If clear, sequences where Veronika is absorbed by thought, or the couple fails to meet in a large crowd, or simply by the film's structure, which constantly distances through paralellism, their proximity. Although the style and brightness at first indicate a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly destroyed by strange edits or camera angles of distracting muscles. <br /> <br /> What is most remarkable is how these blockages to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasizing historical forces. The whole movie, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamless, we have never shown its harsh, brutal timeliness, just its effects on the lovers. In fact, it has been transformed into a majestic spectacle without prospective Germans. <br /> <br /> On the website, the air strikes create delicious effects of light and shadow, or ruins of almost gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris perceived indifference. The empty, ethereal Moscow spaces, the lovers originally than Veronika with his mother, however, are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika, air reporting is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a brilliant sequence that is occupied with silent expressionist terror, where the screen seems to be jumping out with hysteria and violence, the more convincing of the previous scene's wistful gentleness. <br /> <br /> It is not much different that the leading edge, whether fighting over the girls' honor, is more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. Boris's movement and his wounded companion in a last room is an additional abstraction of the war experience, its setting in a forest that gives it a sexual dynamic; and Boris's final, earlier death blockback is an extraordinary blend of dream-desired fulfillment and increased anxiety, where what is desired becomes threatening and grotesque. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the film becomes a little less interesting, a little more obvious. An extra understanding of expressionist overload - Veronika's attempt at suicide and her to save the infant - is wisely handled; And her shameful guilt throws a paralyzing shadow over the whole movie. The use of deep focus, at first conviction, soon becomes worn, devoid of any of the moral powers or meanings Welles brought to use in the CASTLE. After what seems a silent bleak criticism of totalitarianism for the benefit of the individual, one becomes terribly overdue at the end when individual suffering, which so often in Russian art, is transmitted to symbolic (ie, sexless, inhuman) hope. A shame.
