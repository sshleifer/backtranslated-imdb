This is a great movie. I read the short synopsis and was impressed, but when I saw it (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas) it grew on me. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality is such a nice change. The girls get full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without any ridiculous consequences. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are absolutely fun - and many of them are supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or unpleasant. The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was great as the boring hunk - and what's great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him so much. The other two younger male characters were also good, without being overbearing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen that have girls grown up and are fully empowered to see how they realize their mistakes but gradually come through and continue their lives in instead of dragging their mistakes with them.
