Visconti death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While we see, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endless lavish death in Venice is determined; But in other important ways it is an unsatisfactory movie. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and production; by his imperial way, his team-by-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio emerges and obsession arises, it is evident that Aschenbach has no idea whatsoever he is under his Gilded-Age trappings and lived carefully. In fact, after seeing Tadzio, "Solitary" as Man sometimes split him up into two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year-old boy and tries to intellectually treat the giddy scar in blood pressure as he wanted a work of art - a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2 appears as a stalker who takes control, and then replaces the rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual doppelgangs are slaughtered to make human contact with the subject of his obsession - and thus Tadzio remains extremely ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy on this game. Every fate of self-knowledge comes too strong and too late; The thrill of sexual flush is too great to resist. The fact that Venice is gripped by illness means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher bets. When he finally whispers under his breath, "I love you," he knows that everything is lost and the abyss awaits. Is any of this filmable? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. But there are mistakes: He and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as sympathetic; Man didn't do it again. Aschenbach's POV dominates the film and we are expected to identify. But nowhere on the screen is a man torn apart. Bogarde shifts between the sublime controlled and the ridiculous temperament with ease - but what is underneath? Bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. Man writes a character who, in his imagination, makes the seven veil dance, all too aware of the consequences that this freedom invites, but which are not able to resist. Visconti's manuscript also creates a character that is not original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach's - to dramatize Man's discussion of art and artists. These scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor depicting Alfred is hard to see. Visconti's Aschenbach is also a true teutonic composer, which I think works for the film; and the symphonies of Mahler replace Aschenbach's novels. Mahler's amazing music is unfortunately poorly recorded and very badly played. So the Death in Venice, which Visconti leaves it to us, is not the full success it could have been, but as a pure visual experience its power cannot be denied. All film students, especially filmography, would like to take a look.
