What can I say about Kramer vs Kramer? On the surface it is quite simple, but beneath it deals with feelings greater than life itself. It delivers many amazing moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many movies fail at this, Kramer vs Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone agrees that the play is amazing. When you look at Kramer vs Kramer, the scene in most other movies begins to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles, and the characters really live on the screen. There is a beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the movie comes from young Justin Henry. He's different from any other children's actor I've ever seen. He is incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> There is also a kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best achievements in his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the emotions associated are the complicated part of it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, you've definitely missed out! See it now!
