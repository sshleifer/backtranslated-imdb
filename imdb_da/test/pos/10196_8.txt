It looks as if the Robocop author has been wholesale plundering The Vindicator. This is a very solid horror / action movie about a man created in an accident to be used in the cruel experiment. Anyone who has seen Robocop know the story. Beware of Pam Grier as a bitchy and darn great assassin. This very effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyone's taste, but this Canadian excursion is well worth seeking out for anyone who is a fan of the genre. 8.10
