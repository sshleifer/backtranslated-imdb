Odd but wonderful original movie. Really scary, scary and ridiculous in equal proportions. The setting of a high-rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the joking action. The idea of ​​a secretly sealed room in a place like this is good enough, but when the leading naive couple starts cleaning up the old bed they find in this room, the scene is set to some classic chills. Cast is amazing. Tanya Dempsey really gets to chew some scenes after being undervalued in other Full Moon movies. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much bigger in Hollywood - his rolling eyes under the prayer scene are really fun. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon, and this is truly an extraordinary Full Moon / Darkwave release. Danny Draven also instructed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
