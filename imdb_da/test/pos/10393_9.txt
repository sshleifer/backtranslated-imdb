Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the strangest movie I've ever seen. Not for his Cult appeal, or even for his ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a cinema masterpiece. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors. But if you only gave this movie a quick watch, passively, I think it seems to be one of the melodramatic and often meaningless romances. This movie deserves great attention to embrace all its cheese. With cheese I don't mean a slice, but a whole wall of cheddar! The music looks like it is from an Italian porn, the story and the dialogue as if they are from a majestic Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you will beat yourself upside down. <br /> <br /> But once you get all this done, you're involved in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds into the subtle film and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known. The basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate through each other. It is therefore assumed that the dialogue and plot are so cheesy because the conversations are far too irrational with a lack of causality and people's reaction too melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I left that movie, thinking of myself; maybe all life is a great melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as genuine and determined. I hate because I have reason. But what does it think hated? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> So melodrama is actually an existential function. A corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass so we can see how long we are and what we do. It's a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
