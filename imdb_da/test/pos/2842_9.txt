A question arises immediately in this extremely idiosyncratic movie: Who are the insane? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear when the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective that I almost wanted her just a little more crazy, because her created reality was so credible. <br /> <br /> This is the first time Ms. Zellweger has been invited to wear a movie and she is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? however, as scary as usual ?? is pretty subdued as Wesley. He is able to sublime his manic energy, and it is only occasional surfaces and always when it is most needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting allusions: The first time you see Betty, she is dressed almost like Dorothy Gale from the 'Wizard of Oz' ?? So later in the movie, she compared to Dorothy when she says she's never been out of Kansas before. At one point, the song that Doris Day was best known for describes "Que Sera Sera" on the soundtrack, and later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having a whole Doris Day thing. "<br /> <br /> This is an extremely quirky movie with good performances by everyone, including the supportive cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising conclusion that, unlike that, it is actually pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> For no other reason does this movie just look at the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
