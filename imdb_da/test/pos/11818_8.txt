The issue of children being terminally ill is difficult and sad, but the Cure successfully illustrates the idea that it doesn't have to be all stupid and scam and if anything is needed, children must have hope and joy in their life if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable ties of friendship and the child's innocence. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional youth girl with a distant mother moving into a new area where their neighbor's neighbor is eleven-year-old Dexter who has contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his first fear and ignorance of AIDS has been disregarded, Erik is conscious of Dexter, and their closest brotherly friendship sees them begin a journey down the Mississippi, where they have heard of a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure against the disease. The talents of the two young leaders of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, are unusual. Brad was able to portray Erik's harder edge without embracing the subtle childhood innocence characteristic of character, while Joseph portrays the sense of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but sprinkles the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and eagerness to emphasize that his illness does not mean he is still It is a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven year old boy. The couple's interactions create a feeling in the audience that these are two boys who are completely dense and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter's mother Linda, who loves her son and delights to see him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate morph of the other boy. <br /> <br /> Towards an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet movie that flawlessly weaves the story of boyhood friendship that survives involuntarily in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine cute scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have the problem of Dexter's AIDS status, while the children, even the "mobster", will accept him as they would have others. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's street activity, he is more naive in his willingness to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has this scary feeling that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'The Cure' because it is rare to find a movie that is sad and uplifting at the same time.
