It is primarily about love in World War II, but we must remember that it is also a biopsy for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage of his life. The movie's timing is just amazing. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit of those times; smiling and hoping you will not be bombed. Although it may be boring for some, the film has a particularly dangerous edge. <br /> <br /> At one point, my heart ran toward the end when the movie hit its climax. It really has a number of exciting moments that are handled with skill by the four main players. Cillian Murphy is in good shape here, like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it gives an interesting watch. The relationship between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the play to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it's a pretty slow movie. Along with the fact that it is just shy of two hours, it is quite beaten to come to the conclusion. <br /> All in all, it is a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were undoubtedly helped by the amazing number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But that sometimes makes it too much. Still a worthy watch. 10.7
