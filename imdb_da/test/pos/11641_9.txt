One of the clearer statements against the death penalty ever filmed, right a frontal attack against the most obnoxious way of doing justice. The final order, parallel to the crimes committed by convicted Poncelet and his own execution, is just amazing. <br /> <br /> What about Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon's work? It leaves you breathing, they are two giants, and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins makes it clear that he is not only a good actor, he is also a good instructor. <Br /> <br /> * My rate: 9/10
