I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. It played George Hearn and played most of the other role players who appeared in the national tour production that was recorded on television in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of Los Angeles production, although I have owned the video tape for many years. The production and performance could hardly have been better, but the age of the original band showed that both the audio and video quality are under modern standards, even on a freshly pressed DVD. Nevertheless, I still give it 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of work and George Hearns and Angella Lansbury's amazing amazing performances. Even today, my most memorable remembrance of a live musical theater performance is to be Hearn's rendering of "These are My Friends". "You want to drip rubies," brrr.
