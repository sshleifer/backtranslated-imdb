Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare with. I have not found any pleasure in the thoughtless humor of the American teen films, and even though it is a somewhat similar type of humor, I could not stop laughing. I almost never laugh aloud in a movie. And usually a movie has some fun parts for me, but this movie was fun from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I actually buy this on DVD when I find it.
