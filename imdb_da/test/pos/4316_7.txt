In fact, Cynthia Watros in this movie that Elizabeth speaks to is Desmond. Although I am just wondering how she ended up as a "rehab patient" (?) Where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (seen from previous episodes). The last episode is really suspended. The end is not so understandable. I think the author expects the audience to have a season 3 coming. <br /> <br /> I just hope the next season will light up more blurry / hanging events that happened. <br /> <br /> Just don't wait until season 3.
