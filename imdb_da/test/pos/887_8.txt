I watched the film at its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at Fantasia Festival. I was a little disappointed when I was expecting a more epic ensemble movie in the Musa the Warrior line. Instead, the film concentrated only a very small number of characters. Still, the film was solid, thought-provoking and visually exciting. There were little baffling shifts from the dominant thought-provoking and realistic tone of confused loyalty, intrigue and blood, unlike the lighter, more flamboyant martial arts sequences. It almost seemed as if the filmmakers could not make their opinion about whether the movie was a martial art "flick" or a historical epic. History nicely touches on the question of the need for loyalty in relation to the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and your friends to be faithful to their master or come to a time when you have to submit to the wind of change? Is there perhaps greater courage to leave the old roads for new ones? How to decide? These questions have been raised in this film, and ironically, there is the suggestion that the answer given might be wrong!
