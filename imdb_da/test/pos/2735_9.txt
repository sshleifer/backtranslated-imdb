This is a versatile, insightful and bold story of people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and reality. Although the main theme is about an errant young woman, the story flirts well with physics, medicine, religion and even politics, as it questions our perceptions of what is true and what is true. The Kona Sensharma expresses beautifully that the world in which Mithi lives is just as true to her as ours is to us. In that world she is logical, and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish they think to us in our world. Here are some amazing scenes to watch while watching the movie (don't worry, it's not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way the Aparna Sen woven these comments into the story. <br /> <br /> - The references to quantum mechanics and relativity mixed with witch doctor ("ojha" in Hindi) performed his religious rituals, which he believes will drive away the "ghosts" in Mithi's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor prescribes shock treatment as a "belief" solution to work <br /> <br /> - Experience windows - The scene of the review of Anu's book. <br /> <br /> - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director seeking "maya". <br /> <br /> - News stories of George Bush telling the whole world that "there is no doubt in his eyes" there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now it is not as much about Bush's view who I suppose knew the truth as the happy public perception of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. The wife did a fantastic job exclaiming the strange mix of confused thoughts in the brain of a schizophrenic, as her world and the real world collided. <br /> <br /> The monkeys Sen were bold, but not bold enough to ask a big question: Is almost all humanity erring to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people praying and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from all of humanity's history (the ritual / exorcist scene does not go far enough). It would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who is the reality is the right one, the believer or the atheist? <br /> <br /> IMHO, this movie is a much more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "A beautiful mind". It not only looks at the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and highlights our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the former got 4 Oscars, it deserves more - At least one each for history, manuscript, direction, Konona and Shabana Azmi. Watching this movie really was a great experience, and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> It was a story that was very well told.
