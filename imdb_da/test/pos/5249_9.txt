This is an extraordinary film musical. It made me feel terrible that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I had a chance to see her live. Knowing she did a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. concert in 1991 and that I may have been there but not painfully beyond words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia recording. While the musical recording is amazing, being able to see in this movie her face and its immense expressiveness and passion as she sings these songs with terrible sadness is wonderful. Some kind of like seeing Mary's face as she rocks Jesus in her arms in Pieta. Watching her film, reminded me of witnessing a similar exceptional performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid-1990s at Lincoln Ctr. As I sat listening to Mercedes song, I felt like I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical force that contained a fantastic primary force. Some of "The Art of Amalia "'s musical segments touch as Caetano Veloso praises Amalia and sings one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also transfer the incredible international sweep of their musical repertoire and the bonds she created w. fans all over the world. There is a segment where she claims she has played in every city in Italy that has a stage! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia speaks of her struggle w. mouth cancer & how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel. But by watching Fred Astaire's video videos she persuaded herself that life was worth living and turned away from killing herself. Amazing! Later in the film, she quite bravely and admits directly to the interviewer that even though she may have won the world musically, her personal life was a pure grief. She admits she has never been happy. This is tirelessly sad to hear, but totally in line with w. a singer steeped in fado (which she translates as "bad fate" or "bad luck") tradition. In addition, you want to hear more about her personal life: what was in it that made her so sad? What were her disappointments? <br /> <br /> "Amalia art" is a little disappointing in other major areas. My quibbles: Showing 20-30 full songs in the movie yet to only give an English translation to the very first, seems to be garbage (unless the movie was intended only for a Portuguese speaking audience I can't imagine). To see the deep pain in her face, which she sings and does not understand the lyrics, is a disappointment. As for the other minuses: There is hardly any biographical material about Amalia's family background. There is a 20 sec. excerpt w. her song w. her mother (it's quite grand). There is a brief reference to her parents who move fr. the country to Lisbon. I would have loved to see movie footage of the village she came from. The interviews as they are are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (& a couple of close friends). She is a good, but not a big issue. There are no interviewees who are experts in fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we get no in-depth understanding of her musical roots. In short, this is a wonderful movie that anyone interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or final work on the subject.
