I hope the author, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because their work was really incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am by no means affiliated with this film. I'm just a regular guy who's been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and has seen it about 8 times. Every second of this movie touches. Each scene is classic. The action is genuine. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as humans, not actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different killers at different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out, and each sub-point is intertwined and interwoven and culminates in a message that leaves us contemplating the just and wrong values ​​that each of us carries. <br/> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper, and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old boy) offer amazing, real-life performances. I've seen this movie about 8 or more times and I'm still so absorbed in their performances that I forget I'm watching a movie. It's so good. Good work everyone who worked on this. Great job. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderfully matched and joking. With the selected cast, the carefully timed editing and pacing, the mood and tone, and even the subject, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is genuine. It is honest. It is a real movie experience that I will never forget. You must not be in the subject, but it is something you cannot ignore. In the end, it's about people who are people ... and everyone can relate to it. I recommend this movie to fans of drama, excitement and horror over almost every other movie.
