I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I should see it. I was not disappointed at least in the movie, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken bluesman and the nymphomaniac, whose purpose is to cure not only for her sake but also his own ... but it is so much more than that. It's complex and rich, and it cuts you into a gritty, sticky, sultry, blue Memphis without feeling as though you need a bath afterwards. The characters are (mostly) multifaceted and very well written and done. The centers and the dialogue were abducted flawlessly. However, there was a weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best thing I can say to him is that he can withdraw. It is a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he tried very hard. I would definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have good chemistry and respect for each other. This is one of those films where it is no matter how good an actor is, if the other is not up to the task, and fortunately both actors were up to the task. <br /> <br /> The music was very good as you would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, all brilliance was as far as I could see. It was well edited, well shot and well mixed ... everything was great. Characters and set designs were just right, casting the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was the place on ... Loved it.
