Being 15 even I enjoyed this flick thouroughly !! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feeling of loneliness is the same. This movie is perfect in ating aspects, and Natalie is, and Susan's performances are so connected that it's the best screen dual I've seen this year. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who hopes to get away. Because there are a lot of people out there who would want to be "Anywhere But Here" including me! And if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or mother. It is the tears that blend everyone around you more !!
