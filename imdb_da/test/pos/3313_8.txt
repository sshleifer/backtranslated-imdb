This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the life and love of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as three coins in a phenomenon a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in his first lead, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and has his own opposite some strong veterans in the company, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has difficulty losing her beau. Hard to believe anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, her heartbeat, does just that. Sort of takes you back to Paul Neuman rejects the beautiful Elizabth Taylor in the CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, right? Diane Baker, the third lady in distress, meets and dates Robert Evans before he became a producer, and man to Ali MacGraw he is known for. Hope's girlfriend from home, played by beginner Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd, a colleague who has interests in our hope. All three ladies have their drama in front of them. Crawford almost steals the movie. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy self are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the leaders with a yen to squeeze our leading ladies' backside. He is lovely charming. Also in the cast, Martha Hyer, wasted in an ungrateful role is never really explored. Too bad as I like this actress who never seems to have one role to distinguish her abilities. She is in love with a married man in the office played by Donald Harron, whom I had the pleasure of working on in a few Shakespeare games in NYC. He is a prominent actor who is also wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is fun, in Technicolor and cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
