Oz is by far the best show ever to grace tv. Better than the Soprano, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, bold and completely disruptive, yet deeply moving. Oz took us past any image of a prison that someone had ever tame on television. Tom Fontana really did a brilliant job with the writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is a sign of how good TV can be. It follows signs with all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your all-time Tobias Beecher, in the vehicle killer prison. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will disturb you, make you scratch, make you look away, but most of all, it will make you think. Watching Oz is watching a truly magnificent television production
