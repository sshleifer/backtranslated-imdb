SPOILERS BELOW <br /> "A dog's life" was most remarkable for his excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's second 1918 movie, "Shoulder Arms," ​​the quiet movie genius focuses on a completely different mood. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated sets of pieces, where Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's piles are flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can perform his gags most successfully. At a later stage, the soldier dressed up as a tree, a disguise that resembles Chaplin's much-enhanced ingenuity and goofiness. Of course, the soldier kills right to the forest when the enemy discovers his ruse. The subsequent hunting is a visual wonder: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but he uses the forest to also mask the soldier from the audience, so that the camouflaged soldier stands unlocked in the middle of the frame, yet remains invisible. All the while we thought our little hero was pulling a fast on the German army; to our joy, the boy is also on us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
