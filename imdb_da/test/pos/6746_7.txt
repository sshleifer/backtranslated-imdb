This is a really dark movie. Noir actually. The title character is cups brought into New York City unknowingly by Evelyn Keyes. <br /> <br /> She's on a mission when she arrives, and on a more rough after she's talked to her no longer innocent sister. But she herself is not intentionally a killer. It doesn't mean she doesn't kill. It does not mean that her presence somewhere among eight million other people does not throw the city into turmoil. <br /> <br /> Keyes are excellent. The support molding is also very good. There are several known people involved in this - the director included. Don't be cut off. It's a movie to be reckoned with! (And how nice to see a Columbia picture. Columbia and Republic showed great comedies and noirs, but we hardly see any more.)
