How do you know if a movie is good or not? It is the influence it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" disturbs me a lot. I saw it twice. I don't know if I will be strong enough to see it again. No, I didn't feel good at seeing it at all, but the movie was as successful as it could be. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a great job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. I hope many people will see "Dead Man Walking". I think anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty should enthusiastically see the film. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to take to finally convince everyone that this ancient relic doesn't have a place in modern society anymore. <br /> <br /> The movie itself makes no argument for or against the death penalty. It describes reality. The reality is the best argument against the death penalty. A 10/10 for good performances, good cinema and for the main movie made this year. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
