I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most, whenever they wanted. Most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it gives a perfect story. All events are added and create a great plot that can make sense if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and as it is a barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have their own barbies. Anyone can have fun with it because it is so sweet and understandable. All in all, I think this movie is a great movie for everyone, especially little girls, and will give someone a smile at least once during it.
