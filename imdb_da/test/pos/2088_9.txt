I watched "9 Souls" in the Athens 12th International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the film's director was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 refugees, all very different characters from each other. They decide to stay with their red van over Japan. Every time the habit stops, we see these 9 refugees trying to escape their past to build a new life or to fulfill a dream. But no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction. Although it's a very pessimistic movie, it's not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes cannot escape their "prison" and they face a divine (?) Punishment for their "crimes". They are tiny pieces of a beautiful painting in which the Tokyo Tower is depicted as a big knife facing up and down, ruler!
