This is a decent movie. Although it is a little short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grin, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other protagonist do a good job in this movie. The feelings and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the film. It's not typically fancy animal Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This film is just traditional action movie with great acting, history and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and makes you believe that there is actually a real event taking place. Because this movie, I believe, was made with cheaper budget, acting and quality were much higher.
