I've been a big fan of Cky videos, Jackass and Viva La Bam for a long time. They have had a good run, and I expected my laughter to end. But it has not yet. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations and thought it was no better than first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There were many good moments in the movie. If you are naughty, you don't like randomly placed raw humor, or if you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like this. But with that I almost wet my pants by laughing so hard. It had all sorts of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laughing, some great falls and massive injuries made to all cast. Ryan Dunn himself tagged Bams rear end with a picture that will be stuck there for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This movie has already done well, causing theaters across America to laugh so hard, they will want it to last longer. I know I did. This movie did not feel short at all, especially with the credits that continued the footage. But I still want it to have been on forever. Let's just wait and see when they release Jackass number 3! All in all, an excellent movie if you can get past the male nudity and a few diseases pictures. Keep your kids out of this movie. They do not need to see this, at least until they are older. Support the crew and buy it when it comes out on DVD! I know I want to.
