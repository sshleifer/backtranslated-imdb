In a genre of its own, this film has a limited audience and a narrow appeal combined with a subtle undertone that permeates the entire production. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of cinema that is as timeless as a rare work of art. Mounting a time in Québec is rarely seen in films, Mon Oncle Antoine's strength lies in the depth of his characters and the riches of the settings. Duplessis' Québec, parish and feudal, is brilliantly cast as a background that could not be achieved by anyone but a pure laine Québecois. It would be all too easy to resort to stereotypes, clichés, and single-minded myopic statements in this story. Nevertheless, the director chose to skip the forced imaging and instead focus on the essence of life in rural Québec of the time. It makes this movie extraordinary in its authenticity, while it is not pretentious in its presentation. If only several simultaneous cinematic efforts would do the same, it might not be forced to look at the over-skinned Hollywood Pablum that fits the Must See. <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Quebec. A classic. ******************************************** <br /> /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 After reviewing some of the comments, it is worth noting that Mon oncle Antoine is NOT - and it was probably not supposed to be the standard Hollywood / American cinema for mass market sales. An upcoming age story, yes, but far more than simple memoirs of adolescence in the 1940s Quebec. Viewers looking for pure entertainment at the expense of complex character development will be very disappointed. Go see action / adventure / romance / comedies to be entertained. Watch Mon oncle Antoine being drawn into a rarely seen, but absolutely remarkable, society that has been overlooked and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> Wrathens grapes are hardly a thrill, but the story and the characters are what make this American classic a lasting movie. Mon oncle Antoine is in the same genre.
