I never forgot this movie. All these years and it has been in my life. I have been looking for this movie in so many places and shops. If anyone ever reads this and has a copy, I'll pay you a copy of it or let me know where to find one. This is a movie that should be a classic romance known as well as my other favorite, sometime in time. It was really brilliant. If the real actors wanted to reuse this movie and give it the patience it needs to be the right actor, it could be a blockbuster. A love story that is as powerful as this should be for all lovers to see. I remember how sad I was at the end, and it really came as a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she. This was a great movie and it is a shame that it is not available to us to buy. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I would like to thank a wonderful lady who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the movie and was kind enough to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie as I am. With her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these DVDs. She is waiting for the book on which it is based. I check with my local library for that titled 'Mrs Maitlands Affair, by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's good too. Many thanks to Julie for her grace and friendship. I'm always your friend / Sharon
