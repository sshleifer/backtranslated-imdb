Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey deliver wonderful performances here such as Jonathan Silverman, which Eugene tells her life in Brighton Beach in 1937. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie so good is the relationship between characters with an extremely wonderful background family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a great opportunity here as the father of the clan. He gives a restrained but convincing performance as the family's patriarch. <br /> <br /> His sons, played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger, are fabulous. There are some scenes when Silverman skates or jumps, reminiscent of Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they are also wonderful. Their fashionism, intonation and idealism from the Jewish culture are beautifully realized by them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just amazing. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even as the inevitable tissue of war, the film is rich in many of the typical problems facing families during that period. In a way, you don't have to be Jewish to experience what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> A must see for nostalgic buffs and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.
