This movie has one of the best club scenes, very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> some situations (As the main character Carl begins to take drugs for example) Is a little bit of reality, but the plot is entertaining, but the characters are all a little shallow ... I don't recommend you to watch this movie if you don't like techno music <br /> <br /> For the plot / act alone this movie is a 4/10, with the really cool special effects and club scenes and soundtrack it is a 7/10, but if you want to go to the cinema just to hear good tracks and take a small club feeling, it's a 10/10 . the special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it a lot, a shame, there was no dancefloor in the cinema;)
