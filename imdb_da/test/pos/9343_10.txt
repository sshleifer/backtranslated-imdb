John Landis really spoiled himself when he directed Michael Jackson's THRILLER as a short film. Of course, it is corny, the dialogue is horrible, and it all seems too cheesy, but it is perfect, nonetheless. Michael and his date are out at the cinema to see the latest horror flick. When it all becomes a bit too graphic for the date, she leaves. Michael follows On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. It begins there. <br /> <br /> The actual thriller dance is amazing. It's full of these brands, Jackson moves, as well as some memorable zombie movements. It does not seem to be rushed at all, not too long. It all seems to be movie-like, and it's actually quite scary. It is, of course, one of the most famous music videos from time to time, and is probably the greatest music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: See it seriously. The 13 minutes will be some of the best ever used stares on a screen. (5/5)
