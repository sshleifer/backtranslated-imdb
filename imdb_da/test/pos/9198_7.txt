I had heard interesting critics on this movie. I thought it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what the action was about. So when I finally saw it, I found myself in the midst of a love affair between ex-con Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and junkie Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So a love story, but not enough what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film is focused on Isabel as she struggles to get back into society. She doesn't want to return to her neighborhood and she finds herself out of home or anywhere to go. So while she was only experiencing the first freedoms of liberty after being released from prison, she came across Rufo, an old acquittal of her, which, while inside, had become a junkie and was living on the street. When she has nothing to go and without money or possible source of income, she decides to join Rufo in her home: a covered area on a lonely street. The story goes in itself. It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo becomes deeper until the film's almost final twist. <br /> <br /> Definitely the movie is worth seeing. Sebastián Haro is amazing in his role as a junkie. A person who is capable of being both innocent and tender, giving person and a ruthless street foam. Depending on who is dealing with him. I believe in his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not quite think of Isabel Ampudia's role. Although the film is trying to show the bitterness of her through several scenes, she is unable to believe me. She is in a way too sweet and honest, as one might expect from a person in the same situation. The film tries to show a love in a desperate situation. It's an enjoyable movie. But the feeling I get when the movie ends is that Isabel, with the way of thinking and acting, never would have come to that situation. Her role, partly because of the manuscript, is partly hard to believe because of the play. <br /> <br /> I especially like the end and because of that I have raised my judgment one or two points. I liked its bittersweetness and the fact that sometimes survival instincts over other more spiritual considerations are like love. Summary, an interesting movie, but it lacked some kind of a complete "must see".
