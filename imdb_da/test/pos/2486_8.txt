Some aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, especially some of the actors. But I feel this is probably the most important movie in the "era of terror" era. I grew up with hippies and in some respects I still do. It was not until the United States was started down an unnecessary and deceptive war road in Iraq, where I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is a bit dated, it looks like bringing the unpleasant feelings about our current situation right to the surface. Clearly, early in the film, Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the "patriotic" elements of American society. This is definitely an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized communities, but it's CREDITLY. At times, I find myself thinking that the United States could easily enter into fascism. As I watched this movie, I could only think of how I almost every day hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum. This film is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's current political scene. I am both impressed and sad that something that is relevant (and indeed precisely) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate picture of the movie and choose to believe that this could not happen here, take a closer look at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "hostile champions", the rumors of CIA secret prisons and the many events that look like one in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 full years after the production of this film).
