I'm totally this Anne Rice book adaptation. While the majority of the film is filmed here in Australia, it provides a large amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot into. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently awakened from a long period of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire by revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon, his colleagues vampires are suppressed wrong and plotted his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) is an orphan of supernatural studies who have an old vampire family deeply occupied by Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and renews his occupation with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez), an old vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire. Jesse gives Lestat's diary and reads about his first killing and a meeting with the queen of the condemned Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives news that not only angry vampires will be there, Akasha may also come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire covenant, a bar and kills everyone on his way. With Lestat, tempted by royalty and loving care of Akasha, they formulate ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesse's Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) against them. Join her or die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was great, it had great fighting scenes, good music and good places. Aaliyah unfortunately passed in a plane crash shortly before the film's premiere, but she looked amazing on the set and out of the sets. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because it was a great movie and I encourage you to watch it!
