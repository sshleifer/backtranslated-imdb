Helge's best movie by far. Very fun, very surreal. If Bunuel made a movie starring to Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would look like this. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances from the cast, we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as a sidekick at 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays the wife in this one is a little annoying though). And of course Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> PS: If this movie had a proper merchandising, I'd really like to buy a copy of the "Holz ist" painting.
