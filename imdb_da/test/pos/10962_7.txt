What is there to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced in a time of such colorless void, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction. Cassevette's first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves. I draw comparisons with this wave of American independent projects consisting of such "Beat" films such as Robert Frank and Harry Smith with the emerging scene emerging in Paris in the late 1950s, known as the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> They discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with the rediscovery of American cultural supremacy; Even at this stage, this peculiar, highly spontaneous film-fighting fought against the creation of such political lexicons and bigots that kept the art development clear in the mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Cassevette's film explores race relationships and portrays man as weak in the eyes of love, because as a culture we are blind to our own race bias and prejudice. The great element of most of Cassevette's work is that his film has almost a reverse minimalist effect; a mental reaction is caused by subtle character relationships, not so much imaging. Therefore, it seems that his work is about to go alongside because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charters, less reminiscent of explicit actions and more by interpretation. Although my favorite Cassevette's movie is 'Husbands' is his main.
