As I went to see this documentary about Communist musicals, I was expecting something totally denied, like a Communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes provided, including a smoking clip from a Soviet movie called "Tractor Drivers." You would think that filmmakers were tasked with making ideologically correct musicals, singing, dancing, and promoting party line face insurmountable odds. And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented are actually so promising. One was a mid-1950s East German effort called "My Wife Want to Sing", where, as the title suggests, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to start a singing career over her traditionally minded objections. <br /> <Another genuinely interesting movie, also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue." In this film-in-a-film, manufacturers are making their own creative situation with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical. (Movies on the screen even make a song about avoiding "too hot" items reminiscent of the tones of the 1957 movie "Silk Pantyhose.") The documentary is confused by some creepy tale, but it is still very fun to watch . (Look for the final dedication to the person who made it all possible.)
