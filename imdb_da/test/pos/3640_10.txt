Based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, this film is one of the best films I have seen in race relations in South Africa; a very good story lesson of the troubles of the 80's South Africa. I put it on the scale of American history X, inasmuch as it is a portrayal of how a young man can seduce by Aryan teachings and how the "specific" segments of Christian churches learned a false teaching of race to justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It's a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, one of rarities in movies today. Violence is well done to show the severity of Gerrit's crimes and grandeur in his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Jan Ellis, who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. He carries you through Gerrit's beginning to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and has to praise his performance. <br /> <br /> Another excellent performance was Mpho Lovinga, who plays Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you while you saw his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show teens.
