This is one of the best and most underestimated teenagers ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw this grow up and it was and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times" but just so great. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other reviewers, it starts as a comedy and morphs in a drama about half way through. However, it is the beauty and what sets it apart. You get it all. Humor (not unlike "fast times"), drama and a big soundtrack. Personally, I think that every child should come into high school to see this, it would give an idea of ​​their journey is about to begin. Cmon - Which child who sees this would not be able to relate to anything in the movie? The fact that it gets so seriously halfway, however, is also cool and just amazingly well done. You can't even see it coming. Absolutely a lot of surprises. SPOILERS: DO NOT READ WHEN YOU WILL NOT BE. <br /> <br /> Great knee-jumping humor. (Who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to see (especially the last scene of the rough). There are so many women like Karen out there who would have made the same choice she made. Think about it - how many women reject men with hearts of gold (like Gary) for jerks? I know I've done it - and then many women I know have. This movie will inspire discussion, and despite the countless times I've seen it, I leave full of admiration for the filmmakers and the artists. Everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what more likely more than one person. Finally, the music used is just amazing (many cars, u2, lots of obscure (now) songs from the 80s-80s purist's dream.) <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake, It's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, clean and simple. One of the best of it is the sweet and a teen movie classic.
