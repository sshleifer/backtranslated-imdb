The most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a movie is not the beautiful main actors. Nor is it their excellent play and sizzling chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the mis-one scene throughout the movie. The settings, lighting, props ... all add to the mood of love between the protagonists. An alley of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight cheongsams of Lizhen reflect the decision limitations, the ruins of Angkor Wat bind into the deteriorating relationships between the two leads. /> <br /> The excellent use of the mis-one scene gives the film just the right amount of feel that is needed to meat out of the complicated character of the characters' relationship. The film leaves the audience effortlessly longing for more.
