Oz was a great show as long as frequent male nudity doesn't break you off. There was WAY too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you wanted to watch on a porn channel. Minus it was the best show on TV, and a previous commentary said "better than Prime Suspect". Prime Suspect is Tom and Jerry vs. The Simpsons. No competition. If you have DirecTv, they are running again from the start on Channel 101, they are now on Episode # 3. Highly recommended. Creator Tom Fontana also made murder, which was a fantastic show. But why the whole male nudity? We all know that things are happening in prison, but do they really need to show it so often? That was the only thing that struck me off the show. If I want to see naked men, men are raped, I will kill someone and witness first hand. Otherwise, I like my TV shows free of black penis every five minutes.
