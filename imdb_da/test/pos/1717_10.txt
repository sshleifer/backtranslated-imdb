If you are a skilled doctor of the doctor and you cringed when you heard that they were making another series, rest easy - it more than meets the high expectations of the original. Pacing is much faster than the original shows, which more often fit into 50 minute episodes than the average 90 minutes. The script is excellent, it performs excellently. The hardest - and best - to get used to is the production values ​​in the new series. Compared to the original, it has some now. (Although I always want good memories of bubble wrap and towel samples.) If you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and couldn't get a handle on it, then jump in with both feet now! All you really need to know about the doctor, they will tell you as they go together. This series was written with minimal references to the doctor's huge back story, especially to encourage new viewers. Admittedly, I first see the first new series as it appears on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, vulnerable to the band of time constraints), but I'm looking forward to future episodes on either broadcast TV or DVD. (July 4th can't come soon enough!)
