My family really enjoyed this movie. As for what this movie will do for Rugby in the United States ... Well, I'm sure it will be debatable. But for me and others around me, I know we were more curious about the sport after watching the movie, and I personally have gained more respect for the game. You may be wondering about it, especially because the movie doesn't pop in and explains Rugby. But the simple fact is it took you into the players and the feelings of the game and life. The film was inspiring as well as entertaining. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some might think the movie is a small cliché, but I really want Hollywood to do more movies like this. I couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and the battles of life. At the end of it, I found myself investigating my own life to see what I needed to do better to be the best person I could be. In all likelihood, I was grateful for this film of teaching morals, values ​​and teamwork that are so much the opposite. After seeing this, I really hope my kids are being trained by someone who has a philosophy such as Coach Gelwix.
