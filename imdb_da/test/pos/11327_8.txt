I thought it was a beautiful movie. It's not my favorite of his movie - Chungking Express keeps it in place - this is quite different from anything else I've seen of him. it is slow (but not annoying) - it takes time and thinks of the signs .. there is minimal movement in the frame - the camera is wonderful. the action is great. the movie feels like a long hot comforting drink.
