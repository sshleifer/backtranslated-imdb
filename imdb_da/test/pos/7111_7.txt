One year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash, where all their famous character would collide again. "Dracula House" would reunite Dracula, Frankenstein's creature and Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and finally close an era for the study. Directed by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a small but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (but still deficient) story that while far from perfect is a more appropriate closure than the previous movie. <br /> <br /> History ignores most of the events of the previous post, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to history. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of hiding in sunlight, is asking for help from the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor famous for his research in biology. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula, and soon an experimental treatment begins, meanwhile, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), Wolf Man, visits Edelman for the purpose of getting rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood also develops a disease in him. The discovery of Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacomb will cause more turmoil to the radiant scientist's mind. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series go back to the roots and deliver an almost straight-gothic thriller that returns to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of movie and moves away from the comical relief of the previous entrances. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.) has many interesting themes, such as contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure but with different purposes) and Edelman's growing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a beautiful but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman hopes to be healed by her condition. Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally catches the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low budget, Kenton craft is a gothic horror that is simply quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a fresh way. Although never on the original level, House of Dracula restores the charm that Universal Studios horror movies used to have, and Kenton ensures that at least the last time the monsters get a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The game is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange replaying their roles (though Strange's role is considerably less) with more enthusiasm than in the previous movie. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast brings the tragedy and drama back to the series, where Stevens gives a fantastic performance as Dr. Edelman. A little cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the eerie Steinmuhl complete one of the better cast Universal horror films has been this year. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a great complement to the series, especially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's great to see Kenton back in shape in some serious horror movie, and while the plot is quite original, it doesn't just suffer because of the budget, but because the movie is trying to do a lot in a very short time with poor results. It is true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film has very little time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very hasty and uneven. <br /> <br /> While far from perfect, it is also far from being the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times of the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls walked in the fog nights, and crazy scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later, the monsters will be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. After the disappointing past entries, it is easy to reject "House of Dracula" but give it a try and let the monster roam for a last time. 10.7
