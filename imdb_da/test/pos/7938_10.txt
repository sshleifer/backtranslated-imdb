Alexander Nevsky is a series of fantastic sequences of cinematographic opera that go from pastoral to complaint and end in a triumphal address. History takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of Peipus Island. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great historical adventure that shows director Sergei Eisenstein on his most imaginative visual art and climax in a fantastic battle sequence of music rather than natural sounds. Several films have scenes heavily influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation because of changing political winds and then enveloped as perhaps the most influential Soviet historical film.
