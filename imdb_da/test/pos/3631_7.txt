Let's be fair: There are no rules for scriptwriting, so I don't want to say the movie MUST be anything but it is. I just want to state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and the characters are introduced. But I think that when a game is adapted to the silver screen, it may try to fit this other medium. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the game, it is not too surprising that the movie appeared too little for the theatrical. It's man's first movie, for cryin 'out loud! What I say is that there are parts in the movie - like the town of Nordestina, which resembles a little "Hoje é Dia de Maria" - it feels like we are not in a movie theater. We are at the theater! Lines speak too formally, characters move choreographically, and lightning is clearly meant for a stage. Sure, maybe it was meant, but it has been done. On the stage. Amazing things have been done when customizing a game into a movie - the beautiful "closer", for example. When I went to see this one, I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. But overall it was a good, worth seeing. It's a lovely love story, fun at times and sad at others. My vote is a 7.
