This movie is the biggest ninja movie ever made in my opinion, and if you haven't seen it then it's worth seeing. I would rate this film a 10/10 if you want to see more then check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence where the evil ninja kills everyone in his way is excellent, his character is the best. He must then possess a young woman who finds him dying. She then has to avenge the policemen who killed him, meaning there are more killings and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of her goals, make help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to release the evil ninja spirit and destroy him.
