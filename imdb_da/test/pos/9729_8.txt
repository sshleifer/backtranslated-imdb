And she was really beautiful (Laraine Day it is) - herself, her part and her performance. An engaging story of selfish vs. selfless love, for the same man, wealthy heartthrob and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his deaths leads to an incident that scares the community and tests the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are close to him (and to each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial environment is up, as the two girls confront the subsequent crisis and meet their conflicting demands of caution, integrity, loyalty and love, with implications that are profoundly different for each of them. With the ancient vanities and niceties abandoned, their real characters are revealed in enchanting contrast. <br /> <br /> A wonderful find on TCM!
