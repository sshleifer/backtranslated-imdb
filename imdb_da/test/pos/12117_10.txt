This is an excellent anime movie. It is well animated, has a well-designed plot and very good music. I understand that some might think of it as a bit long, but I think it's a good length, and the animation is good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> The way they use tenkai is masterful. For example, the body's double adds all these places to the movie's vicious tone. The design of Tenkai is also good, the way he looks like a monk and in the end the stage armor he is wearing. The old Andou is down to earth and a very sympathetic character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sanpei, Satsuma Shinobi, who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiro's life twice. However, he remains mostly in the background of the movie, but he is really one of the film's hero. <br /> <br /> PLOT: The foundation is good. It is traditional without being unoriginal. The historical time it is traded in is interesting, The meiji restoration. The treasure is coveted by Tenkai to restore the shogunate while Jiro finds it, he uses it to help the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate. How Tenkai-tricks Jiro is interesting and has a kind of a "Hamlet" feel to it. There is also a sweet irony to the fact that if Tenkai had not been given Jiro to become a shinobi, I do not think he would have been able to kill him eventually (perhaps with firearms but not hand-to-hand weapons) ). <br /> <br /> The cause of all death is mostly dark, but there are some bright moments when we see some of Jiro's childhood memories. All in all, it's a good, dark, intricate plot. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: The opening theme is, for example, very good with the electric guitar and drums. They occasionally use that piece of what I think to be taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is very good music. Like it played while traveling to Iga shinobi. I think the play is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute in it. The whistle can be a pan whistle, but more likely a shakuhachi. The end theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The voice is beautiful and it is the song in general. <br /> <br /> The ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but it's not perfect, and the blood running down the figure sometimes seems to be orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. An example of a good transition is when Jiro and Iga shinobi run, there is the sunset in the background and the music plays. The transition is simple but effective and also has a good feeling. MY FINAL WORDS: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make this one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.
