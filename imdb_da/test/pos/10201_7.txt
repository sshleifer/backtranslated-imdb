WESTERN UNION melodramatically tells the string of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Siblings Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for Creightons. Native Americans and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of apparent fate is greatly enhanced by a first-class musical score and lively color photography. Scott is a bank robber seeking to repair his roads, and he and engineer Young both devote themselves to the attentive Gilmore. Lots of great character players help keep the big production ahead.
