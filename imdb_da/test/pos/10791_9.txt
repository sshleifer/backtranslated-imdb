Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. He is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Look at his CV for proof! This movie is not an exception, on the contrary, it is another gem that unfortunately not many have seen. As a controversial movie, this is where you should be grateful. A movie that should encourage you to think of you, the people next to you. The prejudices that exist and that all of us have some form. Either we can admit it or not, but it is easier to categorize people and be like "Ah he is xyz", yes he must be like ... ". Now I might read too much into it, but I don't think so. I think Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for these things. And if it's something you want to explore (like movies or in yourself) then watch this movie and be thrilled!
