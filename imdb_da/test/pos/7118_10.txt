I don't play video games at all, but my kids do. <br /> <br /> I got a big kick out of this. Would like to see more of this type of movie. "very cool" as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the overall storyline were interesting. As I said, I don't play video games, but I think my kids would have had this. It was not full of bad language and it is a pleasant change. This visual concept was different, which caught sight of me. The plus soundtrack was pretty good. I can even try some of the games my sons play to watch because of this movie. Who knows maybe I'll be a gamer someday.
