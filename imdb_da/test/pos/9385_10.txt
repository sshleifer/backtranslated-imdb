This is seriously one of the best low-budget, B-movies I've ever seen. I'm not one to get up and cheer over a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. Of course, the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eat is a subjective concept, I guess, it really sheds sour bubbles to suck the victims in itself and dissolve them in the acidic goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family person actually started his career with this movie ... and an afro. There is plenty of nudity in this flick, so of course not for the kids, but it shouldn't deter anyone from watching this movie. It is my opinion that everyone needs a small death bed in their lives at some point, it is best to get it faster than later.
