"Five Signs for an Exit" must clearly be one of the more clever and better "Twilight Zone" episodes ever made because of it's abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and that ends as a surprise. You have a military major, a female dancer, a bagpipe player, a clown and a hobo, who all watch together at the bottom of a wall and no one knows how they got there and they don't know who they are. So the episode starts with very interesting drama and excitement from the beginning makes it a soul to search for the viewers' interest in knowing the characters true identity and backgrounds. Plus the episode even adds more intrigue to the fact that it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity and peace that are very convincing to the viewer. Only in the end will I not indulge in those who have not seen a surprise, happened! To prove that many times you might be where you are away in your little protected world and be away from the masses of the world of others as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a very different form. Really great and wisely made a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that sometimes happens when you seek and seek.
