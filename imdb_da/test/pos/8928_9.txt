This movie was amazing! So high budget, but felt cordial and original as an indie. The most amazing part of this movie was the amazing performances of David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony, who play the lead role. He brought this movie with ease, humor and charisma balanced with a great depth. <br /> <br /> The camera was really beautiful, although some of the subject matter was pretty ugly. It wasn't that realistic that way, but it didn't have to be a bigger point. It was great to see Alan Cumming in this too. The script was tight and propelled very well with some of the best plays I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> See this.
