This is one of the most cerebral insightful movies I've ever seen. The scripting language, costumes, landscapes, plots, characters, etc. All are supreme. You won't be bored. I've watched intensely or even just listened to this movie while working so many times I've lost count. Scarlett ages gracefully and acquires wisdom beyond his years in the end. This movie takes you from Tara to Ireland, where her family is originally from, and you see the results of another civil war being played out there, this time between Irish and English. <br /> <br /> This movie depicts the dual standards of men at that time - a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores, but not a woman. If she is only seen in a private place with a man, society accuses her of inappropriateness. And of course Scarlett always thought out of the box, breaking rules if necessary to create the necessary change, helping people and / or surviving. Scarlet's beauty is certainly in the bone. Her strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow as she age. <br /> <br /> I remember her lines when I was confronted with too much on my record, which "tomorrow is another day" and the way she carried herself, her determination and courage, and learned from her experience. It is a good movie to show your daughters as it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself and that men, especially very beautiful, can have two sides and can treat a woman differently depending on how she works and respect themselves. An attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is like therapy for me and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland, and anyone who is Irish decent will guard the scene, the people and the Scarlett character within it.
