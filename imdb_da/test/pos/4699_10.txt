I have some good memories that see "Robin of Sherwood" on television as a kid (but I think I only saw Michael Praed's episodes for some reason). And recently, my brother bought the new released DVD boxes throughout the series. It was great to see it again, and it's the best of all Robin Hood movies and TV shows. Casting is great and the sites mixed with Clannad's music add this very special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a good choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are great in their roles like Will Scarlet, Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It's a shame that a fourth season was never made, and I've also heard that author Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film after the show's events. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally have married Marion (Judi Trott), or perhaps Herne Hunter could revive Robin of Loxley (Praed) and he could avenge himself against the sheriff. As mentioned earlier, if the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" would have been wise, they would have been thrown from "Robin of Sherwood" and made the film a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonus material, it would have been great to see them as old men, as in Sean Connery's "Robin and Marian". Who knows, maybe we will see more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now see our favorite series over and over again!
