For those of you who have wondered what an art house monster movie can be like, no wonder. DAIMAJIN trilogy, ca. 1966, was just such a series. More period samurai epics than anything else, these three films are also coincidentally equipped with one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There is not a single facet of these beads, which are unpolished, from the scenario (s) to the performance of the filmmaker's craft. Even the special effects are handled with well above average skills and are integrated (in most cases) almost seamlessly into the movie (s). If you are a GOJIRA fan or fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
