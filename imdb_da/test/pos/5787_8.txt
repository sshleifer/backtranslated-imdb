The end of Suburbia brings together many of the concerns with the upcoming "Peak" of world oil supply. As the world's population grows, it also requires demand for oil and power. When we pull out oil and power, we come to a "peak" in production. More oil is required, less oil is produced. The inevitable result is conflict and great change. <br /> <br /> This movie will disturb and alarming if you are new to the subject. You must react first with anger and denial, because the consequences are so bleak. It would have to be seen. In addition to politics, in addition to optimism, mathematics is undeniable. <br /> <br /> Suburbia is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the communities most affected when the price of energy skyrockets. While intuitive logic will tell you that the big cities will be the places to be avoided in times of crisis, the spread of suburbia will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an effective society without our vehicles to transport us. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion of survivalists and backwoods crazies. This problem will be right at our doorstep than we think. This film is a clear, coherent look at it.
