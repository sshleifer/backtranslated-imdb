*** SPOILERS *** Well-designed and interesting film about the alienated youth in America back in the 1950s. Back in those days, many parents stopped earning big money and living high on the pig, and forgot that their children, especially teenagers, needed much more than a car and a big supplement to feel like part of the family . They also needed love and attention to their growing problems, which is the 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, never came from his successful film producer father, Mr. Tom Itmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never truly associate with his father Hal is growing increasingly distant from both him and his caring mother, Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his father put Hal down for him who wanted to borrow his car, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drove into Hal's beat up and building operations from the 1930s to the local treats to catch the latest western flick. <br /> <br /> It feels like knocking out on the world Hal seems like a very first-rate smoker who sticks his smelly feet almost into the face of a couple, Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and Jerry is trying to watch the movie. This leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, to not only be kicked out of the theater, but with him the theater manager belted Mr. Grebs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater without getting the money back, but when Grebbs tried to get him, he rolled around and bowed him straight into the throat. Hal now in real hot water he is accused of assault and battery, put on his "James Dean" act on the local police station, which makes him either too cool or just stupid to realize what he has done almost knocked Mr. Grebe's teeth out. That's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father is going to pick him up when he finally sucks up to what he has done. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, Hal is trying to straighten out, but can't do it because of the low esteem his father has of him. Begging his father to understand that what he did in the belt Mr. Grebbs, in self-defense Hal's father seems to have been there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal, acting as a street bird instead of a young man being arrested and pushed without provocation. Not sorry what Hal did when he laid out Mr. Grebs, he was actually willing to admit his hooliganism, but he wanted both Mr. Grebe and his father must at least treat him with remuneration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr Ditmas, not even disturbing to hear him! Feel like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mother that really turns too, Hal slowly loses it only to later have both Sgt. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agrees to release the assault. You would think that Hal's now finally learned his lesson, but the right lesson, more than a line behind bars, that Hal's so desperate need was a lesson that his father completely ignored! To be there when his son needed him most and that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors. In fact, things do matter to everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs is belted and ends with a butte of shiner, again by Hal, who goes back to Grebe's theater, tries to make him call his father and tell him that Hal only defended himself, as he first and foremost did not complain about him. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people and not letting his problems become other people's problems. But most of all Hal's father Ditmar learned the most valuable lesson from everyone, how he understands his frustrated and alienated son and acts like a father to him instead of a combination prison guard and a sugar dad. Just like the song says, "All you need is love" to get things on track, and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr Ditmar lacked most until the end of the film.
