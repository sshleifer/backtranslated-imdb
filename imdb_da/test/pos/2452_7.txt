Not for the adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie, looking after war, mental problem, from the other point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to the problem, how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character can't seem to handle, and Martin Sheen's character doesn't want to deal with . <br /> <br /> Protective mothers look at this problem with hot and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.
