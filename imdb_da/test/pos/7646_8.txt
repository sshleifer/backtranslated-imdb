I like Armand Assante and my cable business summary sounded interesting so I saw it twice already and probably again. <br /> <br /> The early part is difficult to follow but later cleans it up. I think the scriptwriter did a good job of tying the loose ends. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are convincing, but maybe it's because I always expect some kind of double cross. In that case, the bad plays will be the incomplete characters that interact with each other so that it fits well. <br /> <br /> The key theme is the carnival owner (Assante) washing money for a local casino & his snake-charmer wife (Dagmara Dominczyk) will steal it. She complains to "Archie" (Reedus) how terrible her life is and how he can help her get out of it. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 plot twists (which are probably the cause of all the loose ends), and just as you think you've solved the mystery, something else will happen. My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won I say no more - I don't like spoilers, so I won't be one, but I think this movie is worth your time.
