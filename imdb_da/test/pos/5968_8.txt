During World War II, two African soldiers (Soviet Russian) are trying to avoid being caught by occupying Nazis as they pull through snowy terrain and seek food and safety. If you do not like black-and-white "foreign" movies, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (pointed in English "The Ascension"). Director Larisa Shepitko changes the film extraordinarily well, despite being a largely introspective piece of work. Unfortunately, her incredible death in a car accident made Ms Shepitko's final film unfortunately. <br /> <br /> After the opening statement is declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snow-covered forests, but Shepitko and a changing attitude make it unexpectedly exciting. Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded Rybak) and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically injured "Sotnikov") avoid success in being crushed by the ever-increasing symbolism. Their allegorical notions under Shepitko's sharp direction give a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
