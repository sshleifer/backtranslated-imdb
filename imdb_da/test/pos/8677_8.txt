Imagine a world where everyone treats anyone nicely, no ugly word is ever spoken, office bickering is non-existent, and your boss regularly invites office volume to self-cooked dinners, where you can chat about the latest interior design styles. Everything is nice, comfortable - good, just lovely. In other words, you are in hell. After falling in the middle of nowhere, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) starts a new job as a bookkeeper in a small, clean city in the mid-thirties. From the start, he feels foreign in this real impersonal world of superficial friendliness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and also colleagues. Food tastes of nothing, drinks don't get you full, no kids anywhere; Andreas is looking for ways to escape the gentle new world after the first steps in the interior design. He doesn't know where he came from for a long time, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - all beyond the indefinite life he is now leading. THE BOTHERSOME MAN resonates ideas from Huxley and Kafka, but here the cruelty is the ubiquitous, non-strange neatness. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it's not about the bigotry narrow-mindedness, more of a fable of our urban acclaim. It is most reminiscent of one of the brilliant FIGHT CLUB scenes where Edward Norton goes through a mock-IKEA catalog. Spiced with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic story survives at all levels: history, character and relevance. A real screen gem. 8.10
