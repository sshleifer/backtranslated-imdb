* May be spoilers * Without a doubt one of the best dramas, if not the best in the genre I have ever seen. Is Prot a stranger or just a crazy bugger? This is the question you want to ask yourself the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is simply amazing as Jeff Bridges. You can't beat this kind of play plus some humor at times. Some of Kevin Spacey's actions in this movie are very fun. When he was up in the tree, for example, and when he spoke to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half-face the wall and just stared. <br /> <br /> Just to say it right from the start you will be connected and if you really love drama, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A solid 85%.
