I am a great fan of Larkin's works, I think he was among the greatest 20th-century poets. The movie itself makes a great justice to Hull's bard. Wonderfully portrayed by all players in their roles. Bonneville does a favor for the sexually repressed Larkin, he avoids an impression and strays from being caricature. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the play itself. Instead of exhibiting the massive intensity that Larkin felt, the use of his words even gives a better insight into the plot and adds a much more bleak but more fascinating atmosphere. Most pleasant.
