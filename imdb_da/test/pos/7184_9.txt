I was a little scared when I went to the movies to watch this movie. In fact, it is always difficult to make a movie from a comic book, and the first episode of the French two greatest heroes adventures was good, but not amazing. Finally, it is very fun from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags, some cartoon characters, no timeouts, great FX, a great cast, great landscapes, well everything !!! <br /> <br /> I wonder, though, how can they translate all the French names into English or German because it is certainly fun in French, but how will it be in another language ???
