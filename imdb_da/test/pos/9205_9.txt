I have read the comments on Las Vegas and agree with some of them, it is not brain surgery TV, but then again I was under the impression that television was mainly for escapism, especially with what is happening in today's world. Let's see it, a show about Vegas (it's not a reality-based program) doesn't go to one based on reality, because to me Vegas is pure fantasy! It is the kind of place where we can go and do it right what we want when we want (subject to funds of course!). Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and dressed with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes. If you don't like it, don't see what we have a million channels for! <br /> <br /> We're coming up to the third episode here in England, and I know I'll be a beeline to see it again. I just hope it won't be canceled, something that seems to happen a lot with most of the shows coming to the UK which are half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). It's harmless, great looking fun and every time I see it, I'll go back to the right thing :)
