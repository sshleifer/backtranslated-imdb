Tex Avery's term of office as cartoonist for the MGM was in the 1940s and the 50s was one of the brightest moments in the cartoon story. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many nice touches that were later celebrated in the film THE MASK. Eyes emerge when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and that is among his best. Droopy is a Mountie, and he is determined to get his husband, but in this case, it is a wolf who has fled the prison. Despite many crazy stunts, Droopy keeps up with this fate all the time until the wolf gives up, because Droopy is apparently everywhere! Full of fun gags and loaded with laughs, this is a great cartoon.
