This cartoon documents the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner, and is certainly better than their first meeting of Fast and Furry ous (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 in the year 1952. Whether this is a very fun card. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and becomes completely tired. The brilliant scientific "Latin" names of the characters are very original and have been imitated before in other unrelated cartoons. The coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression - I know non-boredom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon more than his share of grin in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another ridiculous expression is worn. Slapstick jokes are all fun and mask the fact that inflicting such pain on a bad, helpless, GENIUS coyote is really bad. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket gang is also present. Coyote binds to a rocket that would produce enough oomph for him to catch up on Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket shoots into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: Eat at Joe's. This classic gag comes from this cartoon; Even though it's obvious, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is really the hunt through the mineshaft. The two carry helmet lights and we see the tunnel through which the two go, with only the lights visible. Here comes the comedy to a top. A must-see order, perhaps even the best sequence in the early days of the Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the letter by Michael Maltese when Coyote's light goes out and he unconsciously turns on a fight in a room full of explosives. The surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jumps and spells the letters "YIPE!" after the explosion. Such little things make you laugh all in just seven minutes, and as soon as it starts, it's fun all the time. The rocket pads are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight tree (a sequence that occurs in Space Jam [1996]). Giving away the results would be useless. The free drink turns out to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the penultimate order: the rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of nice animation, except the characters. Although very animated, the two characters are very primitive; which can be an understatement. Although at first it may seem odd, humor in the following sequences is forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, see this. If you love Roadrunner, get this on video. Excellent entertainment (Rating: 8/10).
