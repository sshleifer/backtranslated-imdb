There is a continuous thread in movie comedy that all the big comics just fall under the law or go to jail. Think of the conman's conman W.C.Fields in the old way, or the Marx brothers on an evening in the opera or Chaplin in the adventurer of Mae West in she made him wrong. The skirt of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the law side, the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic. Think of Lloyd in his first talkie, WELCOME DANGER, trying to help "the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a crime wave and getting police hunter Edgar Kennedy to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as bad prisoners in MIDNIGHT PATROL. type of hostility is so patented in all of these giants (and their peers) comedy that even a fake title for a movie deals with it Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series that creates a Three Stooges short, SAPPY PAPPIES, where the boys gets extinguished to be murdered. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is often in law and order to be his opponents in his comedies, look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., where he tries to spring his father from a calaboose But he actually had more conflict from the police forces in his shorts, while in CONVICT 13 he retired to jail when he failed a fugitive sentenced in COPS (perfect title - if you see what you would understand), a big city police force e repeatedly looking for Keaton, wrong for a terrorist. And in the GOD he is not able to avoid the police for most of the film. Keaton is a tramp just looking for food. But he is completely unlucky. When he sees a stranger throwing a lucky horseshoe (as Keaton previously ignored) over his shoulder and then finding a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same and hits a policeman in the head. The police are hunting and Keaton (as luck would have it) runs into another policeman, trying to act normally, but ends up throwing the other policeman on the first road. Soon he has three police chasing him. He is calling briefly at a window in the local prison where the local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. Passing backwards in the locked windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in. Desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken. When Dead Shot flies the police, it is Keaton's face on all the desired posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair would eventually be a successful director of quiet and early audio comics, although in his later biography he would be a stint in 20th Century Fox where his work with Laurel & Hardy was under par.) <br /> <br /> Keaton flies to another city by train (disconnection of passenger cars containing its locomotives from locomotives and bids). This is the movie (by the way) that has two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival at the locomotive is done in a distant shot, with it coming closer and closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton on the cowcatcher. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced Chaplin at the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who argued too violently with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees that the poster calls him a killer, he thinks he killed the man. He is being chased in this city by a suspicious police officer (Joe Roberts) and currently loses Roberts in the park. A statue of "Man-of-War" is being built and the sculptor reveals a clay model of the horse. Keaton is seen on the rental model and tries to maintain its dignity as the horse's clay legs begin to collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet the beautiful Ms Fox who invites him home for dinner. Only he does not understand that his father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the movie, Keaton is about to flee and avoid Roberts while he and Fox get away together. <br /> <br /> It's a fun comedy and a wonderful example of Keaton's work as his best.
