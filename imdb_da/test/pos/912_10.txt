This movie is not just about emotions and human emotions, but also about everything that could be, but it is not. Movie poetry can be terribly boring and annoying, but this movie is great to watch. Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best, in fact. When the movie ends, you can only be sad. After all, it's really good we want more (Well, for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always see La double vie de Veronique)
