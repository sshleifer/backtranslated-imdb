The movie was very good. I am an avid mystery fan and I reckon, usually, who is to be killed and who killed. While I found out who was to be killed, I didn't find out who did it. I was not satisfied with the portrayal of the Gerda character, but given the year the movie was to take place, it is possible that the woman would have been so "cloying". Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamics for those the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I've seen every actor who's been playing him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
