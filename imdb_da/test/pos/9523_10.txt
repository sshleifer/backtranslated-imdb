For all of us American Deneuve fans, this little gem is a bit difficult to get rid of. Luckily, I found myself wrapped in the short bits that I saw preview on youtube.com that I was willing to go to any length. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France, and changed my laptop so it would play Region 2 DVDs. Let me tell you it was worth it. Be warned - there are no subtitles (unfortunately, Pathe should not have released this on DVD, Koch Lorber should have - they are good at the subtitles). I'm not speaking a word French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and what not. Having been said, this movie was a treat anyway. I couldn't fully appreciate the supposed "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. Seeing Deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. I understood what was going on without the need for dialogue. It really says something about a movie when those who can't speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The camera is wonderful. London is adorable as it beat son-in-law. Loved the lesbian mother. And of course what can I possibly say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve. She is one of a kind. Those eyes, that smile. I could see their movies all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say she's beautiful. Well, she is. But she is also very talented. I thought her every second of the way. Her talk about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. Her character is even arrested for smoking dope with some 15 years old on the street. NOT to be mistreated! Fly to France and buy this if you need to. Great. 10
