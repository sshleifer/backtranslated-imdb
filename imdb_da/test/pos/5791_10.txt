First of all, this film is a reality that is very suitable for artistic purposes. Some kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "As Good As It Gets". And of course, something special for all Russian films (of course, the valuable, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of loneliness ... One especially recommended to those people who really want to look beyond all swelling propaganda about communism (both positive or negative propaganda !). A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, fear when touching the real and dirty face of society ... and about the false "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably only true solution: true love ... of course it is very well "placed" in space and time of "russian perestroika", but it applies to the whole community (except a perfect but quiet - not possible to find this on our land!) . For the last time - definitely recommended ...
