This movie is a hard to find gem! It's the story of Juliette, an ordinary cleaning woman working in a yoghurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not notice her, he does not notice anyone before several plots to twist his company away from him who all hit at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning woman, paying no attention to her, they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to address and use to help her helpless and rude boss. The complications are wild, she is not as common as she thinks with five children from five different ex-spouses, all of whom are still in love with her, and he is not as sharp as he thinks he is. This movie doesn't follow a predictable path, and that's what keeps you going. The action is amazing and there are also some very moving moments along the way. The working class shows more wisely than those over them, almost as "Gosford Park" showed that the upper crust is not all it is cracked to be mentally. I highly recommend this movie. See it! 9.10
