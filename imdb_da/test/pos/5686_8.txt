Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its performance yet effective. The film is an Australian film with a low budget, which unfortunately does not get the recognition it deserves as far as creativity is concerned, this is one of the best out there. The setup is pretty basic; Grace, here husband Adam and her younger sister Lee tour some mangroves in northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival, while the crocodile lurks under what is waiting to strike. Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue (another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007) Black Water is not about the audience having fun guessing who is being eaten next, it's about hoping and asking for the three people to Get out safely. <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do a good job with rather demanding roles, considering that it was filmed in place with a true crocodile instead of CGI. The signs seem realistic in the situation, and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. Suspense is built up throughout the film, we do not see much of the being, but just knowing that it is near is scary enough. This is the edge of your seat and is highly recommended if you enjoy original and (most importantly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
