Mas Oyama was the most successful karate champion in the late 20th century. He rejected the "training" of karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no team form of education. He eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools all over the world without compromising on his teachings. Testing in Kyokushin schools is still some of the most physically challenging tests that any martial arts school requires. A non-physical hardship faced by Oyama was due to his Korean descent, and he spent time proving the loyalty to Japan and Japanese karate. This film series was part of that effort, although anyone who had the chance to meet Oyama (I did) would never question his allegiance to Japan. In this series, Oyama's famous student Sonny Chiba is invited to portray his master. <br /> <br /> Oyama comes from the country where he has been training alone. He challenges and does short work with the established karate schools he meets. True to the state of the karate, Oyama returns to his lonely training. He eventually selects a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfighting with a sour bull. How much of the movie is true is questionable. <br /> <br /> It is true that Oyama can kill a bull with its bare hands. He was invited to repeat this feat many times. Occasions have been filmed that Oyama actually does this, although times seemed tame when Oyama went on this year. Sonny Chiba portrays her master with conviction and the carat is quite good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practice, but at that time he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is good, much better than most martial arts films in the drama department. I have always wondered why it is no longer known. Maybe it's the very realistic portrayal of martial arts. People appear tired and hurt unlike 99% of the action movie, where the hero is a boundless energy source, and each battle instantly sends an opponent to death. Chiba seems so exhausted at some point that it hurts to see. Perhaps the viewers do not have their entertainment reflecting reality so closely. Recommended especially for martial artists.
