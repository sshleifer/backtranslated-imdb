Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and author Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American health system with this evil comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital depicted here is full of problems ... from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on it. George C. Scott is the supreme physician on the verge of his own nervous breakdown involved in the outdoor life of Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes. Alternatively, depressing and outrageous, HOSPITAL has some of the most acidic things dialogue imaginable (note how Scott describes his love collection with Rigg). It also has many good vignettes: Scott enriches nurse Nancy Marchand after one of these underground kills a doctor. daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen desperately tries to collect insurance information from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott receives advice from the hospital psychiatry after telling him about his miserable home life. All the actors are top notch. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script, which earns a well-deserved Oscar (over such a fierce competition as CLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening story is invaluable.
