What you saw in BULLITT and the French connection is nothing compared to what you have here. Chase continues for almost 15 minutes and is the best you will ever see. This film has become a classic criminal drama from the 70's filmmaking season. It is a greedy and realistic depiction of the common streets of New York City. With one of the most beautiful wise guys ever put on the screen, Tony Lo Bianco's behavior in this movie is cool as ice. He rips off his own staff and makes it look as if the police are responsible. His childhood wife, Roy Scheider, is a street researcher who gets confused by the disappearance of mobsters. You can tell that Lo Bianco enjoys the game throughout the movie. At times, the movie gets boring, but when you want to give it up, something happens big and it pulls you back. Score from Don Ellis puts the tone of the cold, gray wintertime in New York City and to top it all off, my husband shows Joe Spinell in an early role as the Toredano garage man.
