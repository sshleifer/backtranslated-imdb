Chaplin goes into the trenches of WWI in this germinated comedy that never crashes the war graves. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present, but Chaplin seems oddly ignorant of them all. He is in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It seems like an extended ego trip to Chaplin - a great fun until the last minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and it makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what all soldiers dream of before they go to war.
