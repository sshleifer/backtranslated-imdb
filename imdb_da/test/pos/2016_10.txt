I loved this movie. It is a very simple plot, and from what I understand it is based on a true story. Growing up in the 80s with hard rock / hair metal can have something to do with my love for this movie, but even apart from the music it is a really fun movie to watch. Try it, you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only as a movie of "Citizen Kane" caliber.
