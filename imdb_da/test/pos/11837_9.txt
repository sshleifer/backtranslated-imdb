toplines this ubiquitous comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to gather his adult children from all over the world. Davies works as a corpse in New York when she gets the news that "fathering" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. Davies significant talent as a comedienne saves this otherwise so-called comedy as she disturbs the magnificent British landscape with her American American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth seeing. Ray Milland plays his long-standing "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
