If a joke does not offend anyone, it is not fun. <br /> <br /> The Inki cartoons are insulting, no doubt about it. It's also rap music. Get over it. I suppose any sane black person will find the Inki comics fun, and that the people who are offended by them are white people who still believe that Blacks need their degrading protection against racist humor. Seriously, the Inki cartoons are fun. It does not take me any time because someone is really offended, but because someone might just be offended, I can't buy Inki cartoons or The African Queen or the South of South on DVD.
