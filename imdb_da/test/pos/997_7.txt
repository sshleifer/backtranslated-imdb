Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers of their day? Even an actor who normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave even brought moody charm to a depiction of W.B. Yeats. The writers' life is an infinite source of inspiration. But of all poets, it was Dylan Thomas, the praising, free-loving Welsh who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank to death in New York in 39 years), which was almost in the spirit of the film industry. During World War II, he produced writings for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote a manuscript of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, where three old girls in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. All that is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury's Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a full-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met again by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship between these extraordinary women - to Thomas and each other - is at the heart of Maybury's absorbent film. <br /> <br /> What happened is a story that is almost as remarkable as for the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the grandson of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the film by Cillian Murphy) married Vera while still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the movie when she discovered a book about her grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by David Thomas, describing their mixed life. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the script, is Motherley's mother. The part requires Knightley to sing, and her mother included songs specifically for her. Surely no films with such voluntary family relationships deserve to do anything but succeed. <br /> <br /> We start in London under Blitz. Bomber falls, sirens cry, and Phillips sings to protect the crowds in a subway station. In a pub, she randomly meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship untouched by jealousy or rancor and soon share the beds and bathtubs, listening to Thomas reading his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smashing out their heads, all of them in wartime. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the world's ways ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it is the refined and soulful Phillips who praise Thomas's deepest answer and finally succumbes to his charm. In the meantime, she reluctantly married Killick, who has seen her in the metro station and was immediately imprisoned by her beauty (unless she sings). It's an intense and oddly beautiful movie, though Thomas himself can be his least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood, his verse radio playing in a day of life in the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub, whose name spelled backwards, was not a polite English teacher drawing attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton who read the poem (he appeared in a movie of Under Milk Wood in 1971) and I have never forgotten the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the man's magnetism, is something I missed in Rhys performance. Thomas comes across as a strange pallid, even secondary figure compared to the women in his life. <br /> <br /> In his previous movie, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it gives in the mountains of Thomas's creative inspiration, I should say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egoism, his smoldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing. Thomas had a good war, joke and wrote while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of battle. In a scene near the end, Thomas's behavior towards his friends seems irreconcilable. But that's not Thomas's movie. Murphy gives us a magnificent study of doomed passion and the emotional weakening of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. And Knightley seems almost exquisite to be genuine (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her finest performance. And in all respects the film is worthy of her.
