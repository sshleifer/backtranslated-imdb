"Satan's Brotherhood" is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Why is it not a cult status that is beyond me. This is a chilling story of terror and witchcraft that contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror. In the little American city, some children have disappeared and their parents have been violently murdered. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really scary, some scenes are really unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten. The excitement never ceases, the play is really good, and the climax is bizarre and disturbing. Check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
