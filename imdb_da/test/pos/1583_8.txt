I have recently seen episodes 1-4 and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard they're coming soon.) Commander's Log seems to be a cool hit among the college crowd and everyone else with a quirky comedy flavor. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken to prepare the script is quite clear. In fact, the simplicity of the show made me appreciate writing and acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the decommissioning ... I just wished I could remember all the best for later use on unsuspecting colleagues! Let's just say that if you don't like Commander's Log, I will personally make sure your undies get extra starch!
