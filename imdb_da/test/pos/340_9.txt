Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere films ive seen for a long time. the story of an adopted girl who, on her 9th birthday, learns the truth about her parents. She sits down to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. Mania Ratnam generally tends to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie, every person seems real and their interactions touch and sincere. This is why this is one of his best films. The film is emotionally draining and tugboats in the viewer's heart, while the 9-year-old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. There are some notable mistakes here, especially the scene where Amudha teaches that she is an adopted child, crushes and seems completely unreal. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the way they did. Another mistake is surprisingly the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not gelling with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> Having said these, it is still one of the most exciting and beautiful films to come out of India for a long time. This beauty is not only in the manuscript or characters, but also in technical brilliance, ravi chandran's camera work is a pure poetry. All the characters honestly and the realistic humor, especially in the flashback scenes are entertaining. <br /> <br /> a sincere 9 !!
