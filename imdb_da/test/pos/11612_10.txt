Of course, when you've been waiting for years to watch a movie you've heard about the grape wine, your expectations are just right? f ** k yeah! But when this baby fell through my little door, I knew what f *** ed up visuals would congratulate my TV and choke on my fragile mind. First, Karim Hussein is a film fan who we all grow up on a diet of Argento / Fulci / lynch etc ..... and it shows in this movie, but in a good way. Although I didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first look at this gem, I was just amazed at the pictures of the picture, and the lighting and of course the notion of everyone involved, Karim, must really have believed he should push the boundaries of film production (who trust me he does) and that he should have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same ....... <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about " unconscious cruelty "? Well without pampering it ... it's a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness that turn into madness ..... an unforgettable experience ..... .. <br /> < Watch out for Karim Hussein, he can only go for better things ..... <br /> <br /> I considered the full-fledged printing of unconscious cruelty on a double-disc DVD from Infliction movies that is full with extras ..... Please note that there is a censored Hong Kong release out there, avoid this version.
