Blade is a dark, gloomy but important vampire movie and is one of the best. A little do, but nothing really that bad. Wesley Snipes played a strong role as he eliminated the vampires. Not really like buffy because it's too pretty, but Blade delivers a decent plot, and that's the kind of movie you'd probably like to see on a dark stormy night .... it's at best to see! <br /> <br /> 87%
