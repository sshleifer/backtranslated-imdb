Okay, it may not deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any price, for that matter. The action is not outstanding, there is no need to give credits to the director and it is really just another half-century 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent. Or maybe even horrible. But in my opinion, that is not something that matters. And that was because I had a good time watching this movie. Of course, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but when the movie progresses, something in it you want if you are like me was, and someone else should be when you watch this movie. And it is: looking for 2 hours of fun, thoughtless violence. (And a kick-ass ending that I don't want to spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front deck fool you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that no one saw. Even her biggest hates like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us a lot with her barely credible action skills and a striptease that was not as unpleasant as anything an online pop-up would promise of her but still not so unbearable to speed up or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence in this surprised me; no one in school or on the horror board talked about it as if they were "these new movies are called" case "and" hostel ", but I could safely say that" wax "was more graphic than saw, and some death scenes were actually quite Worryingly. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm not surprised, but House of Wax didn't take a seat on the IMDb Top 250, but it's definitely worth a visit.
