You rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that studies criminal minds and gives viewers a better understanding of criminals who are basically not different from ordinary people like us. What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminals have families and they care a lot for them. That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor. For them, a family consists not only of wives, mistresses, and children, but also includes casual acquaintances and close friends. Contrary to popular belief, Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify the crime in his film, as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays. It shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss. Based on his philosophical attitude, Rifif is worth looking at for his technical finesse. Looking at one of the movie's most brilliant sequences of breaking a safe, it would be hard to believe in thorough precision with which criminal minds perform their plans. This is a scene that no one has dared to copy in Hollywood.
