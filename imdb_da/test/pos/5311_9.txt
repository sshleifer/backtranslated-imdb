Few can understand Leland's character, and in order to do so, they are most likely born to see both sides of life, and to counter this reality is very hard and can cause a few to bad actions (like Lelands signs do) but for so sad and real reasons why his intentions were good, in the sense that the intention of saving another from physically or mentally (in this case) pain over a long time. And it is really sad how basically everyone in this movie is wrong in it, but the one sign to make a good intention is killed by it. The lesson in this movie is for the unique person to see, realize, face and do right in the real life situation you see and do right, or inspire someone who can do the right thing for a wrong situation. But before that ... you must see both sides of something and rationalize it for long peace and quiet throughout human life. Don't be aware of it.
