Melancholy by Haruhi Suzumiya is based on some pat formula now by Japanese school drama anime. The formula goes as such: <br /> <br /> 1. The protagonist comes from the world outside the normal community and has super powers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. A normal character is in there that shares the leading role in history. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in a usual social setting. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the protagonist and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Absolutely no effort is used by anyone to get all the magic powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Normally, people outside this tight nitro group are not aware of their superpowers and move on with their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. Melancholy by Suzumiya Haruhi is made along these lines, which became the success formula for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows a pat formula, the series is unpretentious, and the episodes are always put in an interesting relapse within the normal social settings that always form in unusual circumstances around Haruhi Suzumiya. Each player in history brings some extraordinary insight into the daily life that we are not normally aware of. The philosophical twist of their insight is what makes this series extra entertaining. Visuals are first rate and beautifully made. <br /> <br /> Haruhi's crazy ideas always seem to come together with complicated settings of the story can give you headaches from time to time. It is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out sequentially, which further adds to the confusion. When I saw the episodes in the chronological order, some of the plots were finally sensible. I recommend doing the same. Seeing the series this way is much more enjoyable.

Let me know if you did.
