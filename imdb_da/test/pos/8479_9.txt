A talk about the life of the tormented magician named Ray Charles. His pulse on the piano made fire music, and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool melodies. Every barrier that Ray faced never kept him down and he found his way across conflicts. A real lesson. A good team of producers helps to recreate the era and armed with beautiful costumes, hair and settings, following Ray's history and believing in his true, direct filming! An icy music freezes and hits the audience with smart sound editing. But the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His plays are truly amazing, the most diamond-polished spectacle ever seen. He lives his role. He is the ray of light.
