When I watched this movie at the age of 6, it was in the Children's section of Erol's Video because it was animation. We saw it and it was a completely different ball game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and convincing, but not for children. Avoid family viewing, my mother had almost a heart attack and ripped the video apart!
