I watched this movie as a child about 30 years ago and I haven't forgotten about it today. I couldn't tell if it's a good picture. But these days I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. The memory focuses on the very erotic feeling of the film, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young then and there is another movie that gave me the same feeling: David Lee's great expectations. And again, it was the young Jean Simmons. It's a shame that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I would like to correct my memories ...
