I'm a big horror fan and I really enjoy this remake. With all these horror remakes flowing if I think this is one of the better trials. I saw it with my two little sisters, and I think it made it even better when they were pretty scared. Also with the shouting on the screen "Do not do that!", "Not that way!" Contract. I thought there were some good, little jumped moments, and it built the excitement well. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is amazing in the lead and a very good actress - So she'll keep you alert. <br /> <br /> All in all, a decent movie.
