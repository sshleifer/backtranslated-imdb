If you are a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you have good luck. This film is a documentary of current music in Istanbul, spanning the traditional to the modern. It is very good. You couldn't do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a Romani (gypsy) audience, Turkish hip hop (surprisingly very good) and much more. Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman who sang in a hamam (steam room) that will tear your heart out. Lots of social and political background. If this is your thing, you have a grand time. I could hardly sit still in the theater. <br /> <br /> CD soundtrack is now available on Amazon. Pricey.
