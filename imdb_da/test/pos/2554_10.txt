Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I can't begin to describe how wonderful the performance is in this movie. This movie is for anyone who wants to see a strong story and see an example of how modern movies should look and be. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a young boy, Alejandro "Ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in a one bedroom little loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I didn't even know existed - Willits Points), where there are countless junkyards and body shops. Here Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children who hope to rely on buying and fixing a food van. <br /> <br /> Ale makes money to help in the auto shop, and Izzie helps on a food van; however, both earn extra money on the page. Ale sells bootleg film and stolen car parts; Izzie results in selling themselves. Their lives are surrounded by grist and grim, but even though they both witness, live and hardly survive in their harsh world, their love for one another is never contaminated by the filth surrounding them. And occasionally they can laugh and enjoy the moments in their childhood that are stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have for the Chop Shop is that Bahrani coincides with an innocent love between family members against such a gloomy atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Roma combined with the struggles to grow up too fast in an unfavorable environment like in Bresson's Mouchette. <br /> <br /> Having co-authored, directed and edited both this movie and his first Man Push Cart (which won awards worldwide), Bahrani is a total package maker. <br /> <br /> I can only hope his movies won't be hidden treasures for long!
