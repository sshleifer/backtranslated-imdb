Rent this, I own the DVD, got it for $ 9.99. A steal is so undervalued. Sure there are better movies. Films with fewer or no gaps in the plot or action. BUt I don't have that problem with this movie. For me, if a movie remains true to itself, honest and exploiting its mistakes (and virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its purpose. I made myself fit because its decision makers cared. The whole movie is preposterous from the beginning to the end, but its decision makers took the whole business seriously and I didn't feel manipulated to take the film seriously. And it's so true because I want to take all the movies seriously yet many, oh so many, let me go down. For all its sensations, this movie is almost perfect and totally entertaining! What a fun manuscript! It has also become honestly relevant in the light of the events of 9/11. In no way do I seek to minimize the loss. But this movie incorporates the WTC collapse before it happened in ways we will never see if the movie has been made after these events. "It's either gone too well, or here to stay." "wouldn't you agree?"
