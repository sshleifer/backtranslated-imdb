This was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a bid called Owen, with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang around with Bob. Now Owen is hanging with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very unfortunate. She is also, if you haven't guessed it, is a little lonely. She is also associated with Bob and Alicia, and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wants Bob to have no friends. At the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen finally found himself a genuine, long-lasting girlfriend. Bob and Alicia were driving the night before their wedding, embarking on a small car and then jammed. Way out in the middle of nowhere! Then what happened? What about bad Heather? Did anyone get married? Sorry, the series ended. <br /> <br /> Not even a plea from the TV guide made FOX think twice about putting it back on the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I also loved Heather. She looked cold in these glasses and was fun. I miss this show a lot. It's like reading a good book with the end missing ...... sad.
