This is only commented on because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) might not initially only know how powerful a score and how truly majestic these texts really are. If you read the texts of Alexander Nevsky op.78, nothing here is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving in all musical literature. This movie with the accompanying score has a special place in the world and it can be just as true on the internet as anywhere. Composers own website, which is subject to his property, provides additional care given such a score that this score really deserves. It is for me as deep as it is wide with such boldness that you want to be the one they called the Great Novgorod! This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River on the Neva River in the wide waters. There we killed our enemy pick by fighting men - who choose fighters, the Swedish army. Ah! How we struggled, how we directed them! Oh! Smash their ship at war for slaughter! In the fight, our blood was freely cut for our great country, our native Russian country. Tall! Where the width swung like an open street, through their rows a path where spears jumped! We knocked down the invading Swedes as a grassland grown on desert land. We must never give native Russian lands. Those who march on Russia must be killed! Step towards the enemy, Russian country, arise, rise to arms, great Novgorod! weapons continue) Arise to arms, you Russian folk music, in battle right in the fight against death, arise, in people free and brave, defend our righteous native country! To live warriors highly esteemed, immortal fame to warriors killed! at home, for Russian soil, people arise, Russian folk music! In our great native Russia, no enemy must live. Be in arms, arise, native mother Russia! No enemy must march over Russian country, no foreign troops must rally Russia, invisible is the way to Russia.no enemy must ravage Russian fields. (Here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verse e) entitled "The Dead Fields" - I have to go over the snow-covered area to fly over the field of death. I'm going to look for bold warriors, my fianc√©, my stalwart youth. Here is a trap of a wild saber lying one that is faked by an arrow. From their wounds, blood fell as rain on our original soil on our Russian fields. Whoever fell to Russia in noble death must blow my kiss on his dead eyes and on him I am a true wife and a loving friend. I'm not crazy about a beautiful man, earthly charm and beauty quickly fade and die. I must be married to the man who is brave, brave to these brave warriors! (now to his conclusion with Nevsky's entry into Pskov) In a major campaign, Russia went to war. Russia put down the enemy troops. In our homeland, no enemy must live. celebrate and sing, native mother Russia! In our homeland, enemy men should not live. Enemies should never see Russian cities and fields, those who march on Russia must be killed! In our Russian great, in our native Russia, no enemies will live! Celebrate and sing, native mother Russia! All Russia came in triumph for the celebration. Love and joy, Russian motherland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under very little pressure from Stalin if you want to do it well. This musical score was really much approved by Stalin. For me, there is an unmistakable beauty in how we love this world, and Nevsky tells of a hero whose God as attributes gives for all participation in that love. A truly beautiful and furtive tale of the story of Alexander Nevsky.
