Me and my friends used to gather in a house to see this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only program that ever made us miss the opening hours. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times with Buster Keaton with his clever stunts being pulled off so credibly. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to see again. He had a great ability to make stupid things look credible, and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. He is a completed "Trip and Fall guy" and I remember seeing a trailer sometime where he showed people how to do it professionally. He is definitely the one who teaches people this art. He only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how many talented he is. I lost why David Jason vetoed another series that was made, for my mind was one of the best things he has ever done and I have been a fan of his since he did this series. It is said that he did not like it because it showed the race of his early career. It was good that it might be the right decision when he took it, but now his career has evolved so far, I think it would be a good time for him to make another series that showed him back on his "secret life" full of blunders that he does not see.
