This film takes place on the Australian film Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in dialogue, places, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is especially safe. The direction is stylish and mostly well done. If you liked the early Australian movies by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love "Oz". The direction is similar to this reviewer of Edgar Wright's modern work. This similarity indicates that "Oz" was far ahead of its time. Critics from 1967 hated it and the public went away - the 1960s Australia, like the 1940s USA, was in some ways the kind of place where consistency was important, while this movie is very different from what the viewers would have expected, especially After reading promotional posters. This movie will most likely have more appeal to today's audience: It is still quirkily awkward and self-conscious, but in a modern European way rather than an Australian way of the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared in the Australian television series "Prisoner") plays her role with less crude passion than her contemporary Jacki Weaver may have done, instead of Dunstan's character in this movie, some of the Australian women produce most notorious strength by Kylie Minogue, Charlene Mitchell plays in the Australian television series neighbors and further developed in later roles in his career. Men will also enjoy this movie, which presents various masculine issues differently than most other mid-sixties from the United States or even Australia. Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medon in 'Star Wars III', Trainman in the 'Matrix' films and the chopper pilot in the 'Road Warrior' and 'Thunderdome' movies) plays a central and persistent role in solid support of the rest of the casting. This movie is worth watching for Bruce Spence's performance alone. 7/10 for some minor continuity problems.
