An amazing and thought-provoking observation on the modern life of young people in Japan, as Grains of Sand delves into issues such as rape, homosexuality and violent anxiety in a subtle and significant way. It gives an insight into the youth culture that is struggling to define itself outside of their parents' generation, with the strict compliance and facade. Typically for Japanese films, it is often more important that what is, so for those who are not known in Japanese film and culture, beware. It may seem boring and minimalist (pretty much like any movie that comes out of Japan's Mangas) if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15, and it was originally triggered by my interest in Japan, it's culture and language. Considering that I am now 22 and learning Japanese with the intention of staying there for 2 years, it is superfluous to say that it is a strong film. Enjoy!
