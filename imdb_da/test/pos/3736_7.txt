Despite the fact that there were aspects of this movie that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are good at their lead. The basic premise for the movie is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they met. Both also seek for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the movie that I wished I had seen, play more - where simple flashes only suggested themes that my mind had to fill the whites, such as. Excuse me for the surviving widower, and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty of having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after. An opportunity for a huge love scene was lost as it was simply suggested that they would love the hurricane coming. But in the end, the film left me deeply appreciated by the relationship my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the tear's edge. So I have to say it's worth seeing.
