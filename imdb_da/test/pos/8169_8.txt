Last days is the gay genre's best gay movie. Most of the movies include sappy stories, one night stands, and let's not forget about infamous baseball teams? Last days, in fact, male love contains the kiss in the dark and the right graphic material that made me wonder if the movie belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The movie's emotional journey is what puts it above the rest of the genre. First in this movie I had seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture it can bring. I think when people are crying during movies, they should be beaten, but I have found myself in several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest that all gay men see this movie and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
