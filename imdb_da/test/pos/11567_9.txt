Being a 90-year-old child, I really enjoyed this show, and I can proudly say that I enjoyed the great time and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why; early 90's cartoons had something special; I don't know if that was the uncertainty atmosphere, a generational change, regardless. But "Tiny Toons" kept the mood of the 90s and delivered one of the most popular, fun and underrated cartoons ever created. The mines are creepy, but I can only say that I enjoyed every episode and product related to the show. It was easy, no other cartoon made me laugh in a delicate way (before I entered dark sitcoms for teenagers). The characters were all funny and had the special that they did not have a true main character. Every single character was fun and deserved to be called a lead.
