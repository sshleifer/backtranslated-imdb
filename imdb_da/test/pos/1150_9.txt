I just can't stress enough what a nice movie this is. Just <br /> <br /> the memory of this movie regrets me right now. If you want to <br /> <br /> see a sweeping epic of a movie with amazing actors in vivid <br /> <br /> scenery with great dialogue that reminds you of what early America <br /> <br /> could have been like [what the world could have been like back <br /> <br /> so] ... Well ... I highly recommend this movie. Especially during a <br /> <br /> wartime and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not at <br /> <br /> everything it used to be ... this movie takes you back to a time when we <br /> <br /> just started. When you're American, it really means <br /> <br /> picking yourself up from your bootstraps and getting started. When <br /> <br /> the world was such an undisputed and unknown place. Now this has <br /> <br /> movies there ... and more. Enjoy.
