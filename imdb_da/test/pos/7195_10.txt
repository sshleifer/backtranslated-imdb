This is the first time I can remember where a custom made exactly like the book ... In fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content mixed or removed! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulty sending, communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was played as a quasi-Sith Lord and became annoyed when the Roman Empire endured a battle, it ordered the general to the empire ...? Ah, watch the filmmakers! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in French cinema history, and for my part it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the Roman bashing and Boar chomping Obelix. Clavier, who played the little indomitable Gaul, was perfect and far from his days as the bubbles Jean Reno in "Just Visiting." The battle situation between Artifis and Edifis was fun and was nice to see the Matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect match! The Redbeard Pirate and his crew almost stole the image from switching their own ship to the engine of the Otis (Edifis' Assistant) invention used at the end. <br /> <br /> I understand there is Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same teams back, of Toutatis, I plan to see it too!
