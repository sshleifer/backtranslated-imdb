* Where is Al Capone? <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb lands that part of "Gypsy" in the TV Recovery <br /> <br /> These are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say, except, I thought she was unredeemingly horrible. Mannequin way, poorly reactionary (ie, the shiny, stoic staring while he stares into the scene) and a singing voice that most voice coaches would consider "mediocre". But she is amazingly beautiful and after all, was it not what the gypsy character is about? Payouts on her appearance cuz 'she doesn't cut mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is amazing. Whether she plays herself or plays Mama Rose, it works somehow, and I for one thought that Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the plaster wall of the original. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect underestimated foil for Bette's over-the-top Mama, and he is the intermediate temperature porridge between Middle's hot bowl and Gibbs's coal mush. Riegart is really right. <br /> <br /> A final holler for the man responsible for decades coming from Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. Drag women would kill for glitz and glamor on the screen here. Everything comes up on sequins and bugle beads! <br /> <br />
