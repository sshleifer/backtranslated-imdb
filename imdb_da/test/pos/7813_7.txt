I found this to be an undervalued, quiet compelling Spaghetti Western (also known as DEATH OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (except for multi-purpose co-author / producer Albert Band, the only notable crew member is composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (the newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan lend a mythical quality to the case) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the city and which the law finally holds with gunfighter against a horde of Mexican bandits ). <br /> <br /> There are several hard action scenes at hand ?? The film is covered in a stunning climax where the star's trio is sieged inside a blazing cabin ?? plus a couple of monstrous moments that are something of a Spaghetti Western brand: From the middle of the street, Cord sees a hidden fireman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; A man who helps Cord Escape is immersed in an oil sausage by the bad guys. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a good impression as a country house with whom Cord submits; the supportive caste is so peppered with known (if mostly anonymous) faces ?? I didn't realize that the English-duplicated version of the movie on the MGM / UA's R1 DVD was cut: I was fooled by the wrong operating time listed on the back film was only 99 minutes long and not 118 ?? apparently, Cord's character is killed in the longer Italian version!
