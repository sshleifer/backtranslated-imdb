The funniest movie from the UK I've ever seen, "Supergrass" is a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and sea killings. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), average moron, is out to impress his so-called girlfriend Andrea (Dawn French) because she thinks he's too law-abiding. So to get her to come with him on a romantic getaway, he comes up with a scheme that might impress her and lure her to spend some time with him. The problem is, Dennis's lie is that he somehow became involved in an international drug ring and while she tells her, a few police officers hear his boast and call him. And then this witty movie, full of slim comedy and raw jokes, begins. Dennis is smashed into the local nick, and much to the arrest officers' pleasure there is no way out (Andreas's earlier attempt to explain it was all a lie was dismissed by a hilarious "Stand by Your Man" tune of the two officers "). Then comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes an appointment with Dennis that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, then he becomes free and allowed what he wants. Dennis agrees and is with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable ribbing experience, with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding humorous color to the movie. His walk along the dry box against "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes" is amazing, and probably the best scene in movie history. The two officers' who Nick Dennis is wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as a motorcycle politician are a laugh! If you want something good to see on a Saturday night, then I suggest you rent this. You will not forget it!
