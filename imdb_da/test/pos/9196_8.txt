1. Watched 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): Simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures that survive everyday without a roof over their heads. The movie starts with the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) released from prison, but we do not know what she was inside or how long she was there. She runs over the anti-hero of history and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, as he parks cars for change. They gather together under an old forged building with nothing but each other's heat and a small mattress for their possession. He is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one solution to another, but she has a weird, obsessive attraction for him as a person we eventually accept. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for any of them. She loves this man as he is without question and without having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. She serves her by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows. They eat a baking roll every day and consider it a party. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but does not expect it to happen and does not expect to fit into that role, so it does not think much about it. Both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, Isabel's character continues while the man gets worse and worse in his drug observation. There is a lovely melodramatic conclusion to the story that promises the masses to enjoy, but in general it is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between unworldly misfits that keeps you interested in the end.
