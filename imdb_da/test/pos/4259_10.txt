This film had everything you could wish for, as it was first and foremost considered in the late 1960s. It was incredibly entertaining and gave a contemporary picture of the many changes that had taken place during that period - and was still in progress - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam and the fleeting movement following the quieter pre-war post-war in 1950 's. <br /> All this and one of the funniest movies so or now. <br /> <br /> See it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as exciting as it was originally seen. His humor is just as fun and its message is so strong. <br /> <br /> And when you see it now, you get all this, while giving you the extra pleasure of being a "period piece" and a great chronicle of its historical and turbulent time.
