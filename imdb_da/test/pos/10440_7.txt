Reality Before Reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to "Say Anything" who is grittier? I can't decide but the soundtrack * is * the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie and U2 - I can't believe this, they would never throw all these genres together in a teen movie today. I remembered this as a teenager - mainly the genitals and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80s. When I see it again, I just can't describe how much I love the Rose, playing by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90s, and she was nearly 30 when she was last American virgin, playing with 16-year-olds - amazing! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry on top.
