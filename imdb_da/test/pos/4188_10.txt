To experience Head, you really need to understand where the monks were when they filmed it. <br /> <br /> It was like their series came close, and the group was close to breaking up. Their inventive and comic series (kind of American idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a produced super group around them. <br /> <br /> This is their take on their "pictured image" and the 2nd tier Beatles status. They always felt they were in a box, caught and unable to find credibility despite their talents. It is also a hell of a musical trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind.
