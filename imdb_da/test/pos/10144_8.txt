Unfortunately, because of a slow start, I can't say that this is one of Hitch's best movies. It very excellent anyway. The movie stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents caught in a political murder plot and trying to get their kidnapped son back. They both give excellent performances, not surprisingly of course. Really, however, I was most impressed with Hitchcock's amazing use of music. The opera house climate was fantastic, and by using a live orchestra to create music and excitement at the same time, it was pure genius. Absolutely great excitement came out of that scene. Also the use of Doris Day song "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed to scenes at the end of the movie. So, this movie ends with me being Hitchcock's best use of music I've seen to date. Unfortunately, it had a slow start, or I could have recommended this movie a little higher. Even so, it's still worth a visit. 8 out of 10
