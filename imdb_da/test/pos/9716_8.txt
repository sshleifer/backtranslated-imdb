It would be a shame if you have not yet looked at speed races, whether it's dubbed or subbed (I prefer the copied version (which is rare) because it was fun ... in a good way). What is good about speed races is that you are never too old to see it. go red and yellow !! I first saw this when I was about seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening. It disappeared for some time so I saw it again a few months ago (I'm 19). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia rushing in, singing "here he comes, here comes speed racing! He is a demon on wheels ~ ~ ~" over and over again. Yet the concept of mach 5 represented so many "ultra-multi-function-special-cars", but no one could surpass its genius in construction. the other cars seemed just too much. And it was not just the races or struggling different bosses that made it interesting to me. it was racer-x's mystery persona and how the world of speed racer was basically 'happening' to revolve around it. They did some tweaking to some story lines from the manga, but it all turned out pretty well. though I can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looked like in manga, they did it.
