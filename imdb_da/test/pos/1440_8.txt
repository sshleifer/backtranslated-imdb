From the start of the opening theme, "The Man With the Golden Arm" is classic 1950s entertainment. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes straight back to the old quarter where the old scumbags still lurk. This is a tale of his dark journey with all his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overwhelmed, but it is part of the fun to see. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. This and "The Manchurian Candidate" are the two greatest board members, in my humble opinion. Don't miss one of them.
