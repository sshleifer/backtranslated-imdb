All credit to author / director Gilles Mimouni, who formed this winding, twisted tale of deception and fraud. While keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience in arm's length and never allows them to become fully aware of going further. Even his wise denouement has you guessing. The three key performances are also top notch, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey complements strength in his supportive role. Giving away plot details or character specifications would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this puzzle, and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme of Peter Chase is sublime in his marriage with the idea of ​​the script. <br /> <br /> Many may say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront more in-depth questions about love. For me, it is simply a joking, eerie puzzle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalizing. Hollywood would have ruined this with a good ending. Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> No one does the thriller like the French. When they get it right, they get it right. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is thrilling as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer obsessive as the new Lisa and Monica Bellucci are mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and badly crossed wires. <br /> <br /> All credits must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the notion of the three leads. As Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
