Buster Keaton was undoubtedly the most enjoyable one when making short 20-minute movies, and they no longer come up with ribbing fun. The dead pan cartoon gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a desired crime. This leads to his extensive evasion of several street fighters and fellow passengers who recognize his face from the "Wanted" characters. The goat is a choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene in the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator hunt at the end. A Keaton movie never feels as if its silence is missing, as the sound is never something you need with him. His film explains through the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did for himself. It's not hard to see just how influential he really was - the man is just as wonderful today as he was in 1921.
