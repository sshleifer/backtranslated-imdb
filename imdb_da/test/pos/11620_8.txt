"Subconscious cruelty" must be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. It is sometimes extremely gloomy and shudder, so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage should not interfere. The film mixes many amazing visuals with lots of sleaze and gore.It is extremely strange, malicious and disruptive, so fans of bizarre cinema are not disappointed. My favorite segment from "unconscious cruelty" is "Human Larvae" that shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birthplace is particularly ugly and not easily forgotten. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" should be seen as being believed. It is incredibly hard and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and pig torture. We see Jesus Christ caught by three naked women who are fighting him, ripping flesh from his chest, licking a wound on his knees and pissing at him. There is also a Jesus statue with a protrusion of a swastika on it. "Subconscious cruelty" is a truly memorable movie that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema. Check it out.
