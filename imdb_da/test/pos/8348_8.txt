I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! Which teen does not go through what Scamp goes through and wants to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family? The songs were nice and the sign design was amazing. Lady and Tramp look almost exactly as they did in the original feature. They did a good job on these two voices, also considering that the original voters are probably dead. But I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Well, at least they had the common sense of keeping the same landscape from the original movie.
