This is an enjoyable movie. It's very realistic for the "wonderful world of music" I've been there and done it. It shows a human element in every character and the realism that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. Cleavon Little's character, Marshall Tucker, was played very well. Marshall wasn't a saint himself. Here he was paid to do a job, and he gives these guys a hard time about everything in the habit of going up there. You do not bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he doesn't know any of the dixieland tunes. He has a huge sense of predicting chord changes in tunes that he doesn't know. Not uncommon, but not unheard of. He delivers a true and hard message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player, "It's not a religion, affection is not enough." At this level he is correct, although I think the clarinet player could have handled the job. He practiced his ass and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. Very entertaining movie.
