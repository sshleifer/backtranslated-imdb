In short, if you want to see Burt Reynold's best movie than this one must be included. If you don't like Burt, you still like this. If you love Burt, this can be one of your favorite movies all the time! Being from Atlanta beats it home, but it's also nice to see a policeman / action / drama taking place somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami or LA. The film is fun on points with & good plot and good performances from a large supporting cast (each figure is real & the evil ones are not so unilateral, they are really well thought out). A lovely romance in the second half and it has some good old-fashioned shootouts & fistfights (no CGI, thank God real action!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood made his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with "Any Which Way But Loose "&" Any Which Way You Can "Burt replied with his best Clint-type flick with this, and it comes well!
