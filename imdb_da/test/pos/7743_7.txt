For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so happy to learn that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeping somewhere in their cinematic travails. Relying on the Shakesperean game, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances), upset by his work and his crumbling marriage (to spouse Gene Rowlads), who decides to chuck it all, says in hell with rats and live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald in her film debut) and the new girlfriend Aretha (a shining Susan Sarandon). Although Paul Mazursky is credited as an instructor, the Cassavettes hand is all this movie ... the long scenes recorded without cutting, the improvisational sense of dialogue ..., the self-styled storytelling style, this is definitely his show from The beginning to the end, and if you are not a fan of his work, the movie will be met long and boring, but if you are a fan, there are rewards to have. Cassavettes are surrounded by a first-class cast ... his scenes with Rowland's intensity crackle and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon are a sharp contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut, and there is a stage-stealing performance of the late Raul Julia as Kalibano's, Cassavette's servant on the island. Julia stops the show in a scene that dances with a bunch of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli, who sings "New York, New York". This movie is sad and tragic and fun and intense. Yes, it is a bit long and uneven, and it seems a little too hard to be different (there is even a curtain call at the end of the movie), but it never fails to keep the attention of those who like something a little different in their film going.
