The reason I review this is that the previous review was written by someone who went out of this movie, not even halfway through. Unfortunately for him, he missed a movie of immense beauty. I agreed that the movie was very slow to start. In fact, the friend I was with was falling asleep briefly, I woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film developed from there to a story of love, drugs and how it was to be young and free in the experimental 60s. Amazing performances from the two leads and a good look at the movie, which gave it a genuine authentic feel. Be patient, just as many good movies are well worth the wait, and it is certainly a movie that I look forward to revisiting! 8.10
