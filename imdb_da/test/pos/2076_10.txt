Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever made - no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is horrible and still sympathetic - I especially like the two doofuser playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very harmless and yet scary. Some may grasp the need for a strong Ophelia - she is not a strong person, it is the point, and Lalla Ward hits the right shades. Amazing. Simply amazing - every one of the more than two dozen times I've seen it.
