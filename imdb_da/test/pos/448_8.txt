Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film "The Journey" starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian rebellion in 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who have trouble getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and question them. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who constitutes an American, but in fact a Hungarian freedom fight, which the great believer is smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) hides him. She becomes the focus of the Major's romantic attention. <br /> <br /> Very good movie that conveys the excitement and hassle of the Cold War, and all performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly outstanding as the passionate Major who is not too bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic and powerful achievement as a pregnant woman who does not want her child born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Good script, good director, good cast - there must be more movies like this. Highly recommended.
