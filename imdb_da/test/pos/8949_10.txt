This movie is one of the most fun I've seen this year. A film that deals with death and burial without being depressing or irreverent. Christopher Walken delivers much of the comedy in this charming romance, and I could hardly breathe to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded but cheered. I tell all my friends to watch it come to the US. I'm definitely planning to see it again in the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it's available.
