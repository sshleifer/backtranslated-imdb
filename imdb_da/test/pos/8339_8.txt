This movie, an early William Wellman, has an important message, especially today. It puts the thought that sometimes things are more important than your own personal life or well-being. The film, which has Walter Huston as the leader, is stolen by the performance of "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch. You recognize some familiar faces if you see many movies from the 20s and 30s. It's good you have time to see if you get the opportunity. Recommended.
