I've been waiting to watch this movie for years, and I finally got it! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie ever, and when I saw it, I thought I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the dancing, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it, and it was about important issues (it was at the time of the 1960s) as an abortion. <br /> <br /> The dance in this movie was amazing, just as the actor was! Swayze was brilliant like Gray was too! Although this movie was amazing, you can't say you've seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. It really takes your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, you'd danced at the end of the movie, and it wouldn't really surprise me if it affected people to dance up! <br /> <br /> Overall, Dirty Dancing is a movie that should NOT be missed and even though half of the actors are in, "Where are they now?" Period players will always have this amazing movie in their career!
