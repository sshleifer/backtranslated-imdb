This is a movie that anyone living in Sweden should see. The film shows the political unrest that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It contains interviews with those who were convicted where these people get the first chance after the troubles, to tell their side of the story, and why they think the world can be such a better place to live and be a Part of. I react emotionally when I see this, as I just feel so sad about how these people were treated both during the riots, but also after the riots. I hope as many as possible get to see this movie as it really gets your mind thinking: is it possible? In Sweden, a democracy, in 2001?
