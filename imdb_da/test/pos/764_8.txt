I, as a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well-written film with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most famous character by Ron Weasley. His subtle depiction of Ben and everyone else's beautiful plays made this film very sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the one I think you could call "assistant" to Evie, a retired actress. Initially, it is only a way for him to make some money. But after a while he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben break out of his shell and make him have fun and be happy with himself, and eventually they both need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is a really entertaining one with some very sweet and moments. I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good movie with great and talented actors.
