On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the toilets at Manhattan's Penn Station. Although he is known, he cannot be identified because he scraped the personal information in his passport, and his body is left unresolved in the city's morning for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects in the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73, on his way from India, where one of his biggest projects, the Department of Management in Ahmedabad, was about to finish. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes Parliament's House in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Kimbell's Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile "music boat" design. to give concerts in ports in different cities around the world. <br /> <br /> While celebrating as an architect, little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed before the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, director of this movie, was only 11 years old and had few reminiscences of his father's weekly visit to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he goes on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking to family and colleagues, and visiting the sites that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother, landscape architect, and lover of Louis Kahn why she stopped playing another fool to her wife and never confronted him with this. Tears throw her eyes, but she has no regrets. "It was worth it." It's such a very sad moment. She is, of course, split, treated as an outcast at her funeral, which she was forbidden to participate in, it's almost as if she led to a life of substitution. It all feels strange unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural nemesis, responsible for the rebuilding of his original Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a blow on the ground when reminiscent of Kar's unpleasant architecture ideas. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with anger when the name of the Khan comes up. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's greatest creation, Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete, a large and extraordinary building, of which Bangladesh is very proud. It is one of the few national symbols with stature in this poor nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears to my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - God forbids - the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> The movie is just as much a personal journey as it is a statement of Kar's great architectural heritage and is particularly about the film's production and filmmaking in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn sounded like a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life create a more interesting portrait in this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
