Mascot is the Ladislaw Starewicz masterpiece. It tells the story of a stuffed toy dog ​​searching for an orange after he hears hearing his mother telling her daughter that she doesn't have money. The dog is picked with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the others jump out while the vehicle is running, the dog remains and is waiting to be picked up from the store before he leaves. He manages to get orange after biting woman's legs when she keeps and sells the fruit. As he runs, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the nightclub. There he meets the other toys that jumped from the truck. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to get the dog's orange. I just want to stop here to mention that other wonderful bizarre things happen in the nightclub that you will have to see for yourself. Suffice to say, if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the animation from the past, I definitely recommend you look for this one!
