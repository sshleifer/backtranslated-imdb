This is an OK adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can't say it's new or very good, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. However, given the excellent history, the result could have been better. The movie is quite long, but at the end I felt some things were missing. Sound effects and soundtracks were very good. Action was well done, but the sign development phase was very weak. For people who did not read the book, things can look too fast. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as things from the book, they could have tried to make the important scenes more accurate. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle that history combined with the excellent portrait of the Vatican. You see none of that in the movie. Too much haste and use of time not in a good way are these main problems in the movie. So it's worth looking at, but it could have been better.
