Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals all the scenes he is in. With a good script, this movie changes and gives everyone a chance to show their actress talent. And even though Joan Cusack isn't in that much, but she has one, if not the funniest, scene in the movie. The highlight of the movie for me was Albert Brooks talk of the devil. Only one drawing back is that it goes a little slow in places. And I was only quite interested in Brook's role, not so much in Hunters or Hurt's. I give this a 7 out of 10.
