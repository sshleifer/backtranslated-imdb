Peter Lorre turns in one of his finest performances when a Hungarian watchmaker comes to United Staes to create a new life for himself and one day bring his girl over the big lady to be with him. Lorre's infectious optimism and bright prospects come out very efficiently, making the performance the better when he has his face hidden in a hotel fire, and when no one wants to give him a chance to work, reluctantly turns to a life of crime. Lorre's range as an actor is rarely as obvious as in this movie with his jovial, good-natured immigrant, to his depressing, melancholy, disadvantageous self, searching for the truth behind what he believed America gave him to his suave, intelligent, better - than your average hood for his sympathetic relationship with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. The story is good, has some interesting phrases and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a quality job behind the lens, and all the supporting cast aids with the film with Evelyn Keyes, which gives a particularly good ride as the blind girl. I loved the end - and the truth - that was shining to exist in Lorre's character despite all the negative things that society had done to him. For a small B-picture, The Man Behind the Mask is a great film production for his time.
