The 1990s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly showered with praise, and I enjoyed it a lot, but this TV original is just as good and in some ways more correctly cast. Claire Bloom is not a brash pleasure, but she is still sure to throw her hat on her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). Quieter, quieter and less emotional than the Attenborough movie this may be, but it does justice to what is a wonderful game full of meaningful dialogue. You will still cry for this version, but maybe you do not have the musical prompts to put you off. <br /> <br /> There is room for both - and after seeing this on stage, I would say that Ackland / Bloom is a little more faithful. But they are both excellent.
