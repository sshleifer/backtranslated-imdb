The Earth Final Conflict began as a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique filled with great elements. A very good throw with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex-cop begins to work as a guard for some kind of ambassador for a mysterious alien race (Talons), after his wife's death in strange circumstances. But soon Kilner's character comes to a mission with the mission to discover what are foreigners' truth intentions, so they seem to be so kind and caring for humanity. Soon, this Resistance Group begins to discover Talon's outrageous plans by using the people in their own problems to survive the self destruct. As I said before, the show began great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great mystery because he seems to be a good creature, but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in the earth. Soon came Zo'or, who was not bad, but ... marking the beginning of this show's fall because he became the first great enemy of humans, the incarnation of evil and killed what could be any greater in Da ' an. The first seasons end in a great way with Boone's death, and the other shows a new leading character (Liam), a hybrid of man and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting forces. He replaces Kilner's character in a good way, so another storyline does better, including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. But as I said lines before Zoom's evil begins to take more importance, the new conflicts were less realistic than the same Talons. Over time, the whole big picture of Liam's alien roots was almost completely erased with other things from the previous seasons. So, when the last season began the original Earth Final conflict, it was just an almost forgotten dream, lacking all the magic, just letting some vain intentions to live with the show, including Kilner and Liam's return for a few episodes. The last episode was just the proof of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (to believe that the authors of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories), it was one of the worst ends I've ever seen in a TV show. A real shame because the Earth Final Conflict began as something unique, fresh, the stories thrown after seeing so many exhibitions from the United States, something from Canada from the mind to the creator of the Star trek was wonderful, but eventually changed everything to worse. One day I hope somebody does a remake of this show, of course, uses nothing from the fourth and fifth season (except for the cast, all were perfect in his work). I can still dream in a better thing.
