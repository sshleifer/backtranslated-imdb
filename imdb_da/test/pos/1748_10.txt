Usually I am a typical "creepy crawly-hatin" girl, but having seen this movie (on YouTube of course), I have different perspectives. And I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer has made another movie about insects whose townhouse homes are threatened by humans (enlightened cigars and cigarette butts, footprints, etc.), and how a nice young grasshopper is called Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of honey bee; I love the lovely Mrs. Honey. You know, after watching the movie, reminded my bugs of some of the "jitter-bugs" from Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And out of the songs in the movie I love "We are a couple in the castle;" When I sing that song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful movie was the second (and last) feature that came out of the Fleischer study. The film was originally to be released in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival, Disney, released Dumbo weeks earlier, the Paramount changed the date to December that year, but Mr. Bug went unfortunately into a then unrealized trap of horrible timing. Sir. Accident opening two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor was Mr. Bug a financial disaster and led to the release of Max and Dave Fleischer from the studio they had established in 1919 and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another big factor in their departure was that Max and Dave Fleischer no longer talked to each other because of disputes (how sad it was). All in all, I love both movies from Fleischer Bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
