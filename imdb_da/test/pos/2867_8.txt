I liked this very much. <br /> <br /> The camera's angles are cool, it's not all the jumping like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a good job with the sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Lots of people shouted on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psychic feelings. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror-keepers. <br /> <br /> Kane is much less scary and more credible than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to different situations. There are not many phrases here, but it is wise and original in its own way. Good, creepy, B-movie slasher fare.
