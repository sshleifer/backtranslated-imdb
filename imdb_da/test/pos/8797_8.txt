This movie has a brilliant soundtrack and amazing plays from some rather unknown faces. I especially like the Welsh docklands' bad boy races in the one who stiffens like American rappers that seem tough. The banter between Jip and Koop is brilliant, they come across as being best friends almost as if it were true in real life. I have experienced some of the things in this movie and let me tell you first hand these people don't work (especially with Jip and Koop talking and snorting cola). Danny Dyer is priceless as Moff, 'Party Prescription Dealer' and has the funniest lines in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "I'm happiest when I'm out of my pickle feel the music, you get me .. .. yeaahhh! I knew you wouldn't let me down, I knew it !!! "
