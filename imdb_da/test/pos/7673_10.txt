I once saw this as most people my age (55) back in the 60s. I understand the inconvenience of the final product of both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great opera; But as a movie, it is wonderful. This movie has to be released at least for video, other generations can get recognition of good music and storytelling. The cast consisted of some of the greatest black actors ever, most of whom have now gone away; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until he is gone and the film that the old movie does becomes useless, do it on time. Again, it's a great movie that you can't see very often today, if at all.
