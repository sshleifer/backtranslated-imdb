I always thought Batman Returns was a great successor to Batman. The story was an interesting one, and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave amazing performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and made the comic character more fair than Joel Screwmacher ever did. Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also knows as The Penguin (played by Danny Devito) left by his parents as a child to be deformed. He uses this as an excuse to mask an evil record to abduct Gotham's firstborn children using his goons (Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes the Penguin Mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and revived by cats. Later, she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker atmosphere in the atmosphere. Tim Burton has always had an ability to make grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason I like Batman Returns is that it's fun. It's not just creative, but it's fun too. Something a lot of big budget films these days lack much. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided not to. You don't believe me, see Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thankfully, Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.
