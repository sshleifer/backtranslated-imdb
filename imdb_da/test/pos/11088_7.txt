"Falcon and Snowman" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer who become dissatisfied with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events in the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn convince the leading parts and develop interesting characterizations. The support molding also works well, especially with a performance from David Suchet by Hercule Poirot's fame as an experienced Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The movie is generally effective in determining its premise and developing it and giving a feeling of two boys caught in something they didn't really understand. However, it seems to be lengthy and troublesome at points in the middle. However, the finish is exciting, fantastic and efficient. There are some captivating rock songs included in the soundtrack, but unfortunately a repetitive, soft synthesizer track that does not suit a spy story. There are other spy movies worth more to look out for than "Falcon and Snowman", but it's a decent movie anyway.
