Viva La Bam was one of those who showed that I didn't have high if any expectations before I saw it, and I never even knew about it before I saw my friend see it. I had thought Jackass was pretty funny, but stunts were just that, fun and I never really got into the show. When I saw Viva La Bam for the first time it was the complete opposite, I loved it. It had more of a TV show feel that many of the "reality shows" have today. I was hooked and I wanted to see what new scheme they were going to make up for each episode. All the way to the last episode, it was my interest, and although some of the ideas seemed to be rehashed at times, it always had a newer and more fun twist to it. Viva La Bam is one of the shows that gets you hooked, and I have not yet seen another show that looks like it.
