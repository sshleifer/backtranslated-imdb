I just recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's a fantastic, amazing movie. I knew it by reputation, but never expected to be so magnificent. My version is a shot of 35mm and I'll talk about it again later. When you consider the Western myth in movies, the names are coming to mind, John Ford and John Wayne. Now you only have half the team here, but the whole myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkably epic, where the true plot is the battle for the western expansion of the nation. <br /> <br /> There is a plot centered on a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the greatest villain, Red Flack being memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has an almost random quality as the lorry struggles against incredible obstacles ?? both natural and human. Examples are the intersection of the river, the Indian battle and crossing the burning desert. The struggle of the fight gets a bleak touch when a doll is placed on a child's grave, while a faithful dog lies down on his master's grave. Magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene that the lorry is preparing to leave, Square Dance interlude and the big Buffalo herds are some that are springtime. Marvelous use is made of place shooting throughout. Another feature of this amazing movie is that men and women get the same credit for their parts in the big battle west. Women work, struggle and confront the terrible difficulties of the same strength and strength as their male counterparts. The final has a highly uplifting experience that Coleman and Cameron meet in the giant towering Sequoia forest to start their new life. <br /> <br /> The action is perfectly acceptable throughout. I've already mentioned Tyrone Power's scene-stealing performance. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman's sidekick, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she meets her own problems as well as those who are external to herself. Cartoon help is the weakest aspect of this movie, but these scenes are not common and swallowed up in the movie's huge celebration. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of criticism of Waynes performance ?? Some even go so far as to blame his "wooden acting" for the error of the movie at the box office. I think it's unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and had certainly not developed the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does a functioning job in a role that will definitely play the other enemy to the big overall theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in a large number of low budget B Westerns. I have a number of these and you can see the evolving actor in them. When "Stagecoach" came, he was ready for it, and "The Big Trail" was an essential part of the apprentice. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is a shot of 35mm. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9, which doesn't cause any distortion. Although I didn't have the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to get me the latter. {In addition, the film has shot in 70mm a few extra scenes that are not in the form of regular theater show}. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie deserves to be in any list of the greatest Westerns ever made
