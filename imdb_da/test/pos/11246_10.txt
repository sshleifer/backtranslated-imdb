The fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative about the show is an interesting fact, all of which are their own. If you don't like it so much, don't see it. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers say you have to be stupid, dim-witted or plain old primitive to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I do not claim that all participants are wise. There are clever and stupid. But I would argue that they probably have a higher average IQ than average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said so. There is much to be said for the science of seductive girls. I'm sorry, but please take all the sticks out of your donkeys and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you. <br /> <br /> They are ignorant of social science and especially the science of mating will definitely miss the boat. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: Clubs are not the only places to meet girls. Personally, I think the precious women don't even go to clubs, so they're not going to trade for men like those we see on the show. But what are men like these ???? Apart from those whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. It is men who meet women in the most difficult situations. It is men who take ownership of their own sexuality. These men do not ask for their girlfriends not to break up with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase "let's just be friends". <br /> <br /> Sound known ???? In fact, these are the very guys you fear when you take your special long-term boyfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have "games") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... they are worth laughing! <br /> <br /> If you went to a club and actually interacted with the people around you, you should find this show entertaining. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm at a loss for why there's so much hate for this show. My best guess is that it exacerbates the uncertainty of men who have had bad experiences in clubs or threaten men who think women are beautiful, self-employed smaller creatures who just want a good guy to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment, and best of all, it's REAL. It is a very convincing to take on the latest state of sexual psychology. Sex roles have never been so different from before, and this show gives a really good picture of it. <br /> <br /> I think it takes a lot of intelligence to take something positive out of this show. <br /> <br /> This show appeals to a particular target market, and if you're out of it, I think you shouldn't tune into the show. We could say about other shows, but couldn't we? <br /> <br /> Grow Up, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
