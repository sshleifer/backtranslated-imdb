I have to admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's unheard-of films, and I was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not a leader. I was very touched by it, as I really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one, as I have experienced it from near places. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good at their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and I must also give it to the casting folks to find two actresses that look so similar that I really thought they were sisters (in fact). This is one of the movies Cameron did to act and not to star billing. She saw the part of the beautiful, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, but sometimes she comes out as a rebellion for no reason. <Br /> <br /> Stems from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength is her great sister Faith, little girl Phoebe is understandably very concerned when faith leaves Europe. As she grows up, she goes out to search for her sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth of her sister and falls to her sister's boyfriend. Great history and equally great location shoots around Europe. I'll see it again.
