I watched the film in Izmir as the final film of the Izmir Film Festival. I didn't know anything about it, but right now I'm glad I didn't deny the chance to see Ding-a-ling less! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and believe in me, I've seen zillions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Smart scripts and dialogs ... Smart details ... What else can I say? An indie masterpiece with a completely unique humorous style. You can't stop by wondering what he's capable of right now. Ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and I'm sure the director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I heard that his next move would be a political satire and I really can't wait to see it also among his former works like "House of Pancakes" ...
