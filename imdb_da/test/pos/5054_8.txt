I was glad when I saw my husband renting "Labyrinth of Passion". I love Almodovar's movie. We both loved the movie. We both couldn't stop laughing. We especially enjoyed the scene where the transvestite shoots a picture novel, and while apparently being threatened by a killer with an electric drill, is asked to answer the phone and say, "I can't talk to you right now, I'm going attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survive, I'll call you back. "(It would make a great voicemail message come to mind). We also loved the lady who tells her new, beloved, "I went to an orgy after the concert, but I couldn't stop thinking about you." (I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter). "Labyrinth of Passion" is a tasty farce with lots of high jinks, hilarious dialogue and eye lights for everyone. The movie has had a good age: the 1980s costumes and hairdressers add to the wackiness. I would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but I give it a 8 for two reasons. The first is the scene that involves laxatives that include a shot of a lady who protects herself: completely unnecessary, and it brings down the tone of the movie for Hollywood-widespread comedy a moment. The second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with her father: Shocking, yes, but again it destroys the film's tone. Still, I recommend the movie to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
