This movie is not half bad. It can be a little long at times, but brought along beautiful scenery, a beautifully beautiful love letter and amazing actors, you forget about time and enjoy. However, the Grand Prize goes to Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan as .......... well it would be telling but they are just great!
