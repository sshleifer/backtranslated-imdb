I saw the first thing on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover and the middle fold, which I remember. She is really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me look more of her and so I kept an eye on her in other things. She is in Steven Spielberg's "I Will Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs" as well as lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies. Me and my friends really enjoy her. But her main role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus where it should be, right on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the most beautiful, hottest girl I've ever seen in movies.
