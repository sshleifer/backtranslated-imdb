As a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to watch this movie on the Vancouver International Film Festival list. This movie has great pictures, an excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well-known' London. <br /> <br /> The film is kept entirely in 'dark' colors, which I personally do not like much. In addition, the story was a bit too British, and the comments were sometimes a little flat. Apart from that, there are some good comments from Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE does not exaggerate London by showing all of the city's major attractions, but gives a deep insight into what London really is. From the east end to the vibrant center with its music scene as well as the "special little retreats" for Londoners. <br /> <br /> All in all: <br /> <br /> + Great Soundtrack + Beautiful pictures + great insights <br /> <br /> -Narration -Tyring to see at times -Very dark picture < Worth seeing! I give it a 7/10
