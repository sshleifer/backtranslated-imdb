I saw this flick on the big screen as a child and loved it - cheeziness and everyone. Recently I found a copy of the video and checked it out again. Poorly made, safe ... pretty funny, definitely. It still packs an entertaining blow. It's much more fun than the boring Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing that was "Alive" did better was the special effects. If you're a lover of B-movies, I highly recommend "Survive", not to mention all the other Rene Cardona Jnr movies ... and the Mexican wrestling flicks made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" is a long time for DVD special edition processing. Do you listen, all your friendly folk, to Anchor Bay ...?
