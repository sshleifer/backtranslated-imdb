I went to watch this movie with a lady freind of me who doesn't like heist movies. But she enjoyed it. I missed bits and pieces of the film all the way through. It's a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton decides he wants it all to himself. Then the people he betrayed will come back to him. It's a well-composed, intelligent, fun and action-packed movie that I have to see again ... all the way through. One of my best films in the summer so far. <br /> <br /> A great help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Seth Green and he adds the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster and his roomate stole it from him. He is a computer generic who is a marvel to see. <br /> <br /> It was said that Norton didn't want to make this movie .. but if I were him, I'd have wanted to sign in. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie go-be should be able to say what happens before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with the movie is Eddie Norton's choice of facial hair. The thick, yet thin mustache and a small pike on the chin ... he looks like an 80s porn star for God's sake.
