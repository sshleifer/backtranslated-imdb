This excellent musical film, in beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it is enough to make every person of Irish descent feel proud. Full of joy and celebration of all things Irish, a fine cast with brilliant settings and amazing theatrical trappings, lovely Irish music and the superlative Irish tenor voice of star Dennis Morgan, is the Irish luck to have such a wonderful movie to enjoy again and again! Not just for St. Patty's Day, but all year round. One of the jewels produced by Jack L. Warner in his heyday as a study leader in Burbank in the 1940s. <Br /> <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers not to have this great picture available on home video and DVD!
