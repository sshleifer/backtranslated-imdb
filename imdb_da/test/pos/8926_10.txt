I read a viciously disguised comment on a previous comment stating that this movie showed a bunch of gay boys fighting for their homosexuals. <br /> <br /> This couldn't be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three homosexual characters in it, and one of them is the victim of prejudice for people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of justice. Pip's grandfather wasn't gay. The tenderness of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death. But some people are horrified by a kiss and welcome scene of bowel flying out of a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the equal relationship with Pip and the sweet girl and their turn their social commitment and custody. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
