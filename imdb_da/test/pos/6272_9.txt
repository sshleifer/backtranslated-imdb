This film must have been quietly released on another side of the world, perhaps even in English. Hopefully no one understood a word, there is nothing to understand in this movie anyway! Haahaa! Call me a nut, but I think it's one of the best movies ever. Why should I come to that conclusion ?? Because it's my national time to sabotage horrible movies, and one asks for it every two minutes! When I became a fan of the Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it somewhere and use it. Definitely! The version they bought had the title "Cave Dwellers" using some strange intro recordings, not even from the movie itself (apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their own movie!). I can't say I recommend buying this movie. I'd rather recommend getting the MST3K version. Sure to find the most anywhere MST3K DVDs are sold, don't miss out!
