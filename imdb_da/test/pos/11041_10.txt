Watch this GREAT Classic movie by Greta Garbo and think her performance was excellent. But the German film version, which had English captions, was her greatest achievement. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite, where she had to make the change from silent movies to sound. Greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons to lower the voice for her future roles in film. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was abused on a farm of young boys, and her father left her side as a sailor and then as a ship's captain. There were many scenes of Old NYC, Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and Sky Line in Manhattan. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", "62 a classic veteran actor gave a great support role.
