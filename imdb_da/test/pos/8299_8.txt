Robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (a lovely dotty Peter Cushing) lives their way into the earth's core in their spiffy pier machine. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous giant animals and people used as both food and slaves of evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, working from a gentle silly script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant pace all the time and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing severity, thereby giving this image a certain clunkily serious quality that is entertaining and endearing in equal measure. The legal hokey (not so) special effects are completely (unintentionally) fun. The cheesy selection of custom creatures is especially positive side splitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber boots pterodactyl men, as well as rinky-dink savage monkeys brutes, and a hilarious ridiculously passionate seeds that blow up really well. One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a bold and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clapping a doll in his slave jaws. In addition, we also get some appalling rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. It is a unified experience to see that Cushing pleasantly hammer it up into a rare wide comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic, arrow-winding action hero in the final third of the girl. The magnificent Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as it picks Princess Dia, plus there are cozy supportive fluctuations of Cy Grant as a gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous sweep Hoojah. Mike Vickers' exactly varied scores switch between happy orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's sharp film image adds a gloss to the infectious inane procedure. A complete campy riot.
