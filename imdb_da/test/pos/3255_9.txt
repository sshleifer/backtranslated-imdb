Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and it's 'top ten at all times'. I stumbled across two hands by accident (maybe it made it more specifically - no inflated expectations) on the IFC one night and couldn't believe I hadn't heard anything about it. Now that Heath Ledger is becoming more famous in the United States, I'm sure it's more accessible. At that time, I told friends about the movie and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC view. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the black-comedy / gangster genre it fits well with my other favorites, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is fun as the biggest gangster who makes origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. Also hilarious is the quick editing fate of a random car thief. Even Heath was pretty good at it. At that time, I vaguely remembered him from a brief series on Fox called 'Roar'. Hopefully Gregor Jordan will make another hit, but as far as I'm concerned, this is his best yet.
