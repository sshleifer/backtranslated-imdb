I think the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well. It has the very authentic feel for that period. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the computer's magic or if it was right. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was especially impressed with the scene of the bridge. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, who also acted well, showed us a nervous, witty woman, using herself to seduce men to get what she wants. <br /> <br /> some of the scenes were fun. Although it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining movie.
