I had long wanted to see this romantic drama (with another World War II) and now I have everything I can say that it is a true masterpiece of Russian cinema! Soviet films are known for their extra-terrestrial propagandist approach, but fortunately this is free of such weight - with the interest attached to the central tragic romance of a promising artist and a lively girl who is convicted of the outbreak of war he would like to volunteer, but from where he never comes back. The girl (a remarkable achievement from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin, and when she does not receive words from her boyfriend, gives the latter and marries him. He is, however, an ambitious concert pianist who is bitter about the war and who has fought his chances of success and also that the spike is still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her. Finally, the word reaches the girl to her beloved death, but at the end of the film she has learned to accept this as a victim to their homeland and is happy to live with her memories of him. <br /> <br /> The movie features some truly amazing cameras that make extremely proficient use of the screen space, and by often adopting tracking, tilting, and high or low angle shots, it gives the power to the elaborate emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene, frantically edited and sped-up for boot, where the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the adolescent's premature death in an unfortunate event ahead, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I've ever seen (with the sun off him, symbolizing the life that seeps out of his body as he imagines wedding day he never has!). Also noteworthy, however, is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home, which has been hopelessly destroyed during an air strike; as it is her last violent capitulation to the concert pianist - as she tries to resist by repeatedly beating him in the face - taking place during a later air ramp and making particularly effective use of a set of undulating curtains! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the R1 DVD of this excellent movie is a bone affair (the RusCiCo edition includes a few supplements, but being an export tends to be highly overpriced and difficult to trace to start!); Criterion released it along with another war-themed Russian classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my friend on the local DVD expiration has told me is coming ... The only other movie I've seen from this director, the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969, albeit via the much shorter version of the US release!), a stellar international production based on true events; Considering the unmistakable artistic quality of CRANES FLYING, I now regret his famous documentary, I AM CUBA (1964), a number of times when I was in Hollywood last year: except he received a week's theater performance, was shown more than once on television accompanied by a feature-length "Making Of" !!
