I had my son on the weekend and my parent called me and said they wanted the two to meet them at the cinema. When I got there, my mother said she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked about my son and I was thinking that it was labeled a chick flick. I reluctantly agreed to believe that this was another "First Wives Club" type of movie. I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the opening stage to the credits. It was a great production, and the molding was perfect in their roles. My son and I found ourselves laughing the whole movie and we are glad we saw it. It made for a good Saturday afternoon movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
