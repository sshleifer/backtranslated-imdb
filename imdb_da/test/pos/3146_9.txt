In the world of "shorts" (most of which are not), this film is a gem. <br /> <br /> A quiet and precise look into a young woman's world, a reader of a blind woman, here star Elizabeth Franz - this film carries textures, layers and visual narration of a lavishly painted still life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is amazing and the direction safe, clear and convincing. I watched this movie at a film festival in a high and crowded Tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that evening) the crowd fell silent. <br /> <br /> It says it all.
