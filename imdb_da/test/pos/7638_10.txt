I watched this movie thinking that it would be terribly horrible and was ready for all corniness, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked the whole alternative reality / dream state that played into the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a straight two DVD movie and I liked the overall look of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I end up hating the woman's driver, but there was something about her that kept me interested. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but I was also expected. I don't know if I would highly recommend this movie, but give it a try and you may be pleasantly surprised. I put this on my guilty pleasure list.
