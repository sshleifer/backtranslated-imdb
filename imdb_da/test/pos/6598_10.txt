I must say that this must be the best documentary I have ever seen in my life. I first say the movie to my friend's house and didn't get the chance to finish watching it. From that time on I spent my spare time finding the movie. I never found it, but my birthday, my friend who knew I was having the hardest time finding the movie, gave it to me as a gift. Sean Penn does a good job of telling the documentary. I loved how it told the story of each of the Z-Boys and Dogtown's history. I have been to Venice and the surrounding area many times and had never known what had happened until I saw the documentary. I didn't get the chance to watch the actual movie, and I heard it wasn't near what the documentary was. I don't know if I actually want to see the movie, but who knows.
