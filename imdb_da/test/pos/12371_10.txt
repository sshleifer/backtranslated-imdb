Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new audio track recorded by KTL. The duo, made up of American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian bearer Peter Rehberg, has created an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and highlight the original movie recording from 1921. An eerie banging introduces every law and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the gloomy drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack, the movie is still the real star with its timeless reproduction of a dark and dystopian adventure. According to this story, the last person is condemned to death before midnight on New Year's Eve to spend a year behind the toes of the eponymous phantom cart and collect the dead souls. This is the fate of the film's anti-hero, David Holm, who has moved to painful control of his life after his incredible death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the cart. <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as a horror movie, and although this is an appropriate label, the real horror is not here in the supernatural elements, but rather in the depiction of human suffering in the hands of others. Shosta gives a remarkable performance as the drunk, pointed and threatening Holm of life, and the miserable, frightened Holm looks back from the land of death and shrinks from his former deeds. Striking imagery is abundant throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The middle unhappy beginning is strongly illustrated through the image of a dial that floats alone in darker night skies as another moon. Just as impressive, the dead are depicted through groundbreaking semi-transparent images and scenes from the phantom cart ride across land and sea remain chilling to see. <br /> <br /> Shostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most respected silent films of all time and KTL's new soundtrack is an excellent accent on its themes. This is a must-see.
