It seems that we should recognize the Scandinavian cinema for more than just the Dogma 1995 movement which cooked by the Danes all these years ago. The Bustling Man, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought-out film, yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and below the surface. As a movie alone, it is a frightening comedy about societies and attitudes in the postmodern world we live in; A world judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy, it feels that the film dives deeper and raises questions, at least to me, about metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to uncover the truth of so much material in our world that it may seem alien for us. <br /> <br /> This was truly a great introduction to today's Norwegian cinema for me. The film is very much in the category of the European art canon with its deep themes and ambiguity enveloped atmosphere while maintaining an open finale and not so much a story as a procession of events that can mean a thing or another . So many times we have watched movies using the The Bothersome Man setting, and so many times it has become a close predictable routine of a detective story or a chase story or something like that, but this movie allows its attitude and the situation to act as a background for its protagonist, Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to investigate who he is; where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are. <br /> <br /> The setup I'm talking about implies that the hero arrives at a place without prior memory or what happened before that. I jump right in and say it is in my opinion he is dead and has been sent to some kind of purgatory, like all the city's residents. Everyone in the city that Andreas interferes with is of the same age; The same mentality and attitude suggest that most of them are victims of their own suicide, and they have been sent to a purgatory without feeling, feeling, color or, most importantly, pain. <br /> <br /> When we first see Andreas, he comes out of a bus, which he later discovers, is scary in his abilities and approaches a gas station in the middle of rural areas nowhere. He is scruffy and has a big beard, but soon he will be the opposite, sporting a suit and tie; clean shaved face and a home of its own complete with a new job, where the film makes one of the best transformational changes between rural and urban areas that I have ever seen. But the new job as well as the new city are troubled; You can take breaks when you want managers to be exceptionally friendly and there just seems to be no feelings or reaction to anything. These ideas are best across a cinema when Andreas, who is still a relative beginner to the city, cries and is clearly influenced by a movie on show, but everyone else looks in stone-like style. There is also the first example when a man has jumped from a window and is placed on some tips, but all move on without standing up. <br /> <br /> To back up my idea that everyone is already dead and the city is acting As a kind of purgatory, death and injury are generally impossible. There is a particularly unpleasant scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and a person's thumb, but everyone's response to the event is stone-pervaded and it grows back within an hour. Similarly, a suicide attempt involving trains comes later, nothing, and instead we get the point of how it is to be dragged down pipe tracks with disinfection on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society where the masochistic need for self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual relationships can occur and be broken up equally, but under both emotional and passionate circumstances; a place where people can attempt suicide, but it is impossible to actually die. The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in real life, and thus the film says that you cannot kill yourself twice, yes you cannot feel pain or feelings in a lifetime in the afterlife. <br /> <br /> But the movie's best part is the one sneaking at you. Judging by the last five minutes of the movie and the side story opening up to involve some music from another man's house, there seems to be a fine line between the spaces that the film dictates as 'heaven' and 'hell'. We see these spaces only very, very briefly? so short that they consist of a single shot. The 'Heaven' is a colorful kitchen with music and children playing: It gives life, hope, feeling and happiness, while hell is a snowy place that backs you thanks to its hopeless build and spooky cut-off. The introduction of these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and co. facing: purgatory and everything that came with it, the afterlife was just not ready for Andreas and his free-minded, adventurous mind ?? and see where the teeth end.
