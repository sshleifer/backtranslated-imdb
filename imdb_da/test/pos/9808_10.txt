Even people who do not like the movie, usually because they find the end confused, should appreciate the strong action of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello who played the two young leaders in this movie. Spoiler WARNING: At a literal level, the end makes no sense. People who believe the end makes sense at other levels are divided between those who 1) believe that the younger brother was killed by the stiffener, either then Mike (the older boy) was unable to handle the neighbour's gang or flew out the desired place in his wagon to escape the situation through death and the 2) who think the younger brother is imaginary and his flying in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals to overcome the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I favor 2). It makes a lot of sense in relation to the way many children deal with abuse. It is not uncommon that an abused child splits his psyche and projects it abused himself in something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. This makes it much more sensible that it is always the younger boy who is mistreated and never Mike. In fact, it is unlikely that one of two brothers will get all the abuse, even if it happens. It is also Bobby, the younger brother, who is also the encouraging one, who insists that they can overcome the situation. Also the death of a spouse's sister through abuse would have been too crushing for an adult with this in his story to transform into such an optimistic fantasy that ended like this.
