Lady and Tramp II are very colorful animated, and the songs, especially of Junkyard Dogs, are quite good. However, the family seems too idyllic, and I can't help understanding that Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. However, I am also pity Angel, who has never had a loving family before meeting Jim dear and Darling. In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and Tramp are better than this sequel.
