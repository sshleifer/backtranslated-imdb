Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part song of a horror movie. This film he wrote / directed / produced and starred in the details of the songs from these songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People have commented that he should have a fun mind to put something like that out. I hear no one who writes comments about Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz or in his own time Alfred Hitchcock. The film profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was pretty well done by pure imagination and inspiration, even without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you hug and feasible. IT CAN HOPE !!
