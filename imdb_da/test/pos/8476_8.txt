This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer / legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African-American city, and he became blind in 7 years, but with his touch and hearing skills, this is what would later lead him to the star in life. By the 1960s he had achieved his dream and sold records in millions, and led the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed its fallout, including the separation from his wife and child, because of his affair with a band member, his drug and alcohol use and in prison because of this. Also contributing to Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix like Joe Adams, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, CJ Sanders like Young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It's a great story with a fantastic singer's impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director of Taylor Hackford, Best Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 99 in 100 years, 100 Bowl. Very good!
