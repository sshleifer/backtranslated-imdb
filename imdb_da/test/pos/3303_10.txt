Best of all. What's the best of all? It is different for everyone, but for most of us it is love. But unfortunately, not everyone knows where or who to look for true love. This story goes all gambit to look for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as it says, "we are the captains of our own ships" and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we have made these choices, we must live with them. When we see this story and we see that these women make choices that are likely to change their lives forever, we wonder, would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? Who knows?
