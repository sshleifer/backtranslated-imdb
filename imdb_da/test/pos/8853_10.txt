When, in 1982, "The Thing" came to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor cashier office results, which became almost a mistake in John Carpenter's career as a horror director; But time has shown that "The Thing" was certainly not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the movie's fault. Today, John Carpenter's "The Thing" has gained the recognition he rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without reason like this new version of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s "Who Goes There? "(previously adapted as" The Thing From Another World ") is closer to the original narrative and holds a pessimistic sense of fear and high doses of excitement in a masterfully crafted paranoia study. <br /> <br /> The reason for "The Thing" begins in the winter of 1982 in a US research station located in the Antarctic remote areas when crew members keep a Norwegian helicopter coming their way. The two seemingly crazy pilots in the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​entering the American base. After the Norwegians have been accidentally killed, Americans are trying to find out what made them mad. Soon they will find that the Husky dog ​​Norwegians hunted was not a normal dog, but a creature that could mimic all living creatures, and not just that, it has a huge hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when, in 1978, he directed the half-master "Halloween" where excitement and atmosphere were over and over. "The Thing" could be seen as a development of that style, because even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (which were marked by critics as "repulsive" on his day), the film is increasingly focusing on atmosphere and excitement rather than in the violent (and very well done) screens of gore. The feeling of loneliness as well as the "bad karma" between the crew members increases the feeling of paranoia, as anyone could be Thing, even our protagonist, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) ending in a situation where no one can trust . <br /> <br /> This ploth element was more faithful to the concept of the closet and was obviously ignored by the previous version (not quite a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and More like a new view of the source novel. Bill Lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to fully trust them, making them a major factor in the film's joking sense of fear, which continues to run through the film . The mystery and excitement are at the maximum, since one can never tell who is Thing and who is normal, improves paranoia and the unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. The casting is very effective and their performances as a whole so effective that you can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. The joiner's permanent partner Kurt Russell as MacReady wears the film, and through his eyes we experience the insanity and the scare that the research center becomes, as the situation gets worse. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also fantastic as Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering Things' purpose. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its mistakes tend to go unnoticed even though they exist. The most notorious is the very poor and sometimes unjustified score of Ennio Morricone. It's not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place on some scenes, and it's not one of the best works of the legendary composer. Because of some misunderstandings with special effects, some scenes were omitted, which actually fill some small plot holes, although it is not of great importance or indeed annoying. <br /> <br /> Speaking of John Carpenter's movie, most people will almost immediately call "Halloween" as their favorite movie, but I would personally go "The Thing" as I consider Carpenter's greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror movies ever made. I would go as far as calling it one of the finest movies ever made. 10.10
