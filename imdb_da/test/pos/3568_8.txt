"When I die, someone will bury me. And if they don't, what is the difference. Life's philosophy (or lack thereof) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic, yet nonetheless fun spinoff by Sergio Leones" Dollars Trilogy. "<br /> <br /> In the opening scene, three, of course, evil guns are riding into a western city and with frightening glares they frighten all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. Each of these three bears a striking resemblance to Leone's For A Little Dollars More, a guy in Eastwood's poncho, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit, and one seems to work like Gian Marie Volonte Indio. Not about these guys. Not until they drive into town when they are shot down by another cooler than them, a mysterious bounty hunter known as the alien. <br /> No. This is a completely different story . <br /> <br /> In an obvious copy of Leones' The Goo d, the Bad and the Ugly, three guardians again guarding a hidden treasure. Once again there are bounty hunts and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a super cool bounty hunter with a passion for shooting people while dressed up as a priest. He is after the reward of bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when Monetero gangs steal three hundred thousand in gold coins, the alien sidetrack gets out of his normal working style. <br /> <br /> To round off the trio is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank manager, Clayton. He also wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is shot is. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion showing a family crest. The game is also to find the treasure before anyone else does it. And any gun can play. <br /> <br /> With lots of bullfights, fist battles and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three-way drawing for the hidden treasure ala The Good, the Bad and the ugly - but with a twist. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as Leone's movie, of course, but ultimately, that gives a pampering, huh? This movie is fun - 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty, and no right or wrong - just the tax and what is required to get it. And even if the film is not classic, the end is for sure. Hi, maybe we can all get together for a hundred thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, check this out. It is fast, furious and worth looking.
