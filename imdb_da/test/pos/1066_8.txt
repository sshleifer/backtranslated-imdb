Forget about Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and choosing this smart comedy of error instead. I assume that only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's second great Christmas gift, "Meet John Doe" is not honored with the same love as ... well, you know that name. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's type rag, who for many years has lied to his pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She is an ace b. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the sea after 18 days and 6 weeks of recuperation in a navy hospital. Released in the last year of World War II, the film is dusty with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday oasis, but never sinking to sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her fight in the hunky Morgan with whom it is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to play married to Gardiner's award-winning architect who has actually searched her hand for years on her farm in CT just to trick her boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop & double-entender humor to support as Babs' true source of culinary talent & Una O'Connor is fun as Gardiner's unpleasant Irish housekeeper.
