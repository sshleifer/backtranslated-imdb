I loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and adapted to their roles. The story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect, and the message of the human reaction to the war, danger and risk was unusual. The person who wrote the music score also made the music of life beautiful (another favorite of mine) - his comment was apparently that "... this wasn't like an English movie, it was like an Italian movie." I think he's right! Callum Blue is perfect for Eric Eric's part. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a story that is true and morally uplifting and a beautiful love story.
