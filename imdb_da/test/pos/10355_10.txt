This film is about an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live on. So a Dr. Lloyd Trenton is paid to transplant Amir's brain into a "willing" participant. But in the doctors basement, his dwarf assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains young girls blood for doctors' purposes. So, Doctor Llyod looks like a man to kill the people who helped Amir to the land (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and various unknown bodyguards.). Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. While this has happened, doctors second assistant Gor sent out to get a body for amir and makes him so hurt that Dr.Llyod can't work. Meanwhile, Grant Amir's "girlfriend" finds Regina Carrol and tells her his story. Grant sees the man who drove him off the road and Dorro kills him. Then, since Gor failed to get a body, then Llyod puts Amir's brain in Gore's destiny body. Then Grant and Regina go to the doctor's lab <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ---------------- Find out his secret. Soon Amir (Gor) is prancing around killing people, and in the muddle of what I think is plot Dr.Llyod has a brain ray gun that hurts Amir on command. It turns out that Dr.Lloyd wants a country where all researchers can work without law. Then Regina dies. and at the end, Amir's new body (I think) says it should be a new country blah blah. <br /> <br /> I still don't get the end but overall it was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese. This movie contains Grant Williams in his second final film roll. I recommend it to any fan of Al Adamson or if you like Brains.
