I had read the movie and thought it would be nice, a good good Saturday night movie. I didn't expect anything big, it was mostly fluff but hopefully not a bad experience. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it went well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was great to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before, but instead moved from stereotypes and focused on the character's wittiness. It was great to see Jonathan Caouette again, I didn't know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is gem, a great young character actress who hopefully gets more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie that could have used some work, but overall not a bad time at the cinema. My friend described it as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but it's more than that. It's a character study about how it is to grow up gay in a small town, the pain is there, but humor behind the pain (which only age can make clearer) is magnified. I look forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
