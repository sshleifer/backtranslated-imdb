Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling take in the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, also Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on true porn actor John Holmes, who, as Dirk, was known to be extremely "beneficial". This is where Dirk finds first success. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Nights are obvious in a movie of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, fraud, violence and music. Boogie Nights employs the porn theme with some control. It is not overplayed, and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, cocaine plays tremendously, and the film's setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the fabric at the time the movie captures perfectly. Boogie Nights, however, does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes that involve addiction and overdose. For example, at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed; Blood picks up from the nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film, before these scenes, has been quite optimistic and comic, but from this point it darkens the darkness that it will occur. <br /> <br /> The music scenes are performed brilliantly, from super-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out Dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with melodies from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The standout scene throughout the movie comes down to the music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the drug dealer Rahad Jackson's (Alfred Molina) house to get some quick money from selling counterfeit drugs, but Night Ranger's sister Christian, who plays in the background, Increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, showing that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with those kinds of scenes, making the movie even more amazing. <br /> <br /> Standout performances in Boogie Nights are Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic but moody movie director. In the scene where he is attacking a young guy to slate his films, it's a complete shock to the audience, because by that time he has been pretty nice and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who deliver his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie that uses common themes, but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has fully captured these signs of a time when nothing seemed to go wrong or at least until the 80s arrive. Then things get very dark, and all signs of recognizable characters and situations from the film's first part have gone. However, this does not reduce the high engaging entertainment that this movie offers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not a box-office success and earned just Â£ 2 million in movie theaters in the UK. But it's not the film's or director's concern. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations because at the end of this movie you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple moral story, but one that will remain in the days of mind after You've seen it. Boogie Nights is immediately shocking, fun, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.
