The BBC's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by Sarah Waters ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas. I really just love a luxury for the rich and free ?? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" both give amazing performances as the leading ladies ask this question ... OF EACH OTHER ... while Rupert Evans shines like the lovely bad "Gentleman" .. with great support from Imelda Staunton's "Mrs Sucksby", David Troughton's "Mr. Ibbs" and Charles Dance "Uncle". The reason is turning around and I wasn't sure I could be led to care for signs that could hurt and use each other this way ... but somehow. I don't care ... and it's because of the quality of the performances ... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate .. betrayal .. confusion .. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you get dvd " one and enjoy. (Elaine Cassidy is just amazing in this .. beautiful actually .... I have to declare I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
