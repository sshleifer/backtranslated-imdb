_Saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than what is expected of Western audiences. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it both in terms of interesting topic and the magnificent images that this film contains. Some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is plenty of interest that most should survive the _Saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast forward. <br /> <br />
