Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a brilliant piece of cinema. From the play by Viktor Rozov, based on his own game, Kalatozov shows us a vision of war heroism and the suffering of those who are at home. Overwhelmed with countless war films shows us the front line and the bloodbath, the subject itself becomes boring and avoidable. This Russian gem, however, shows how the story of the obsession can be told in a different way; by telling us, right from the mouth of the soldier, how war is hated by all, that they hope that those who died did it for a cause that allows for peace and the end of the fighting, we see a new vision about World War II. We have young men who volunteer to wage war for peace, to keep their families and their loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a fight they don't believe in. With so much hatred against our present situation in the Middle East and how people die for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a movie showing how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return. Communist Russia shows how involved everyone was in the war. While Boris may have voluntarily gone to the front line, his father is the chief physician of a hospital that helps repair soldiers who are injured and his sister helps him there as well as his girlfriend Veronika, does everything she can to keep her by the fact that no letter has come from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys to a party. Even the factory for which Boris and his friend Stepan work, sends representatives with gratitude gifts. Whether it's all a glorified look to Russia at the beginning of 2. world war or not, I do not know. There are no protests or bad eyes of these boys who risk their lives for a country, it's all praise and thanks. Some in America can learn a lesson from this because, regardless of whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protest and exercise chaos in its name, it is only sullies what these men and women sacrifice everyday and everyday. <br /> <br /> It is very much everywhere, but some deserve single out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the only family member he can trust, and her sadness at his departure is very clear on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what may be the best performance. As I said at the end, fathers who need to choke back hidden tears, Merkuryev indicates these feelings. He puts a hard outside, especially cracks and passes on his son when he finds out his volunteer work just hours before he has to leave. But when Boris goes out to the assembly station, we see the true pain of man sitting in grief at the table. He loves his son dearly, and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a lucky lucky young man and idealist, does what he thinks is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the scurvy Mark who lives at home because of his talented piano skills or perhaps just stealing his cousin's love. The love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience into her grief, rejection, and slender glimmer of hope. The true star of the movie, she has to go through many emotions on a journey where she loses her way and needs to drive back on the track, hoping she made it so fast enough for Boris return. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of history, as well as being scared of using tragedies to get the theme across, I also loved the movie's visual style. Sergei Urusevsky's movie is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in full screen. It is one thing to create amazing compositions in a widescreen panorama; It is completely different from that of a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along the water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers jump their way up the screen and into the distance. There are several instances where the camera is behind obstacles but still allows the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blockage to allow overhead shots and exaggerated joints of the frame together. <br /> <br /> However, the real facts are the cases of the long shot. Used well at the end of following Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier, as she walks through those who say goodbye to their loved ones while she is seeking Boris, her own goodbye must be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive, because she is weaving in and out of people while the camera focuses on parakeets, people are shouting at each other and more, all focusing on specific moments while the camera is moving through. Everyone needed to make his mark exactly and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It is only part of a masterpiece of tone and style; The cranes fly showing how successful the location and mise a scene can be in showing the audience what it needs in the simplest way possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the crew can work wonders and bring something that great sets and special effects can never do.
