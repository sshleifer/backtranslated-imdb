Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. I experienced extreme frustrations while watching this movie as I was on the way to the two leads to reunite. It never happened in the end, which disappointed me to no end. But the end gives a more cynical touch to a generally cynical film. It's not a movie that people are likely to rewatch, but a clock in itself will have a profound impact on people. From now on I haven't rewatched the movie, and I don't think so. <br /> <br /> History follows the experiences of a man Max who is engaged to being married to Muriel. He remembers his old boyfriend Lisa (he considers this the love of his life) when he accidentally listens to Lisa, who is talking on the phone. So he tries to find Lisa. Here, his extremely frustrating search for Lisa starts. There are many layers for this movie. There is an undercurrent of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The film moves through a wide variety of terms and leads to an end that could be interpreted in many ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a film about occupation, jealousy is made in such a light hearted way. It has a very fast pace, which is probably why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt the ending was perfect. I don't think he should be a pure character given that he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged, and he also has a fling with Alice. Alice's character is even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsions can really annoy the viewers (that's what I believe). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her who wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lies and games and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end she understands that she must get away from it all. The end gives a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max's love for Alice is temporary and false. It's like saying that love is generally a temporary feeling, and it's better to choose the safe option (ie, Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting (ie Lisa or Alice). In many ways it is not really a romantic movie, but a satire about romance (in a way). The performance deserves great praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a good performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not quite sure of his commitment. His geeky look is an added advantage as it fits perfectly with the figure. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced depiction of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene where she screams "I'm also a nutcase" really shows her desperation and her longing to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> Btw I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that may be taken from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable occupation of lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It can be far out when she calls on Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa about a girlfriend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa, and she loves that time. It can cause many to question her sexual orientation. Overall I would give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I deducted one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it's a perfect movie otherwise.
