I happened to catch this on Community TV a few years back and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable a movie it was. While it is a bit corny in some ways, as the primary function is to be a mysterious thriller, it works great, thanks to a manuscript that creates a brilliant plot; It kept me guessing all the way through and the decision is inspired. Cast is a star occupation containing a mix of them at the end of their career (actually Richard Long died that year, this was made) or those who were on the brink of stardom in hit television shows (Kate Jackson , Tom Bosley). They all do well, except for Cesare Danova, who sleeps through his role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
