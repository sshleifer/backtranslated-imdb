While researching Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) during a Bonanza episode, I was reminded of this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably as good and one of his best), which is one of his best. <br /> <br /> This episode is responsible for more 'bests' - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But this is "The Twilight Zone". Further comments on the series are unnecessary. <br /> <br /> '5 Characters' is typically Serling. Intense, dramatic, barreling towards an end that is so inevitable in thought, as it is surprising the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is pampered in a phrase and is too good to pamper anyone who hasn't seen it. <br /> <br /> But you will feel disturbed. And you will never listen to Hendrix with the same ears again.
