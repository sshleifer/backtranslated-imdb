The only thing I really can't forget about this movie is the start: classic comedy, brilliantly crafted. I love it. See it yourself (no spoilers here! :-). The sparring between DeVito and Crystal also shines in this movie, with DeVito as the perfect suppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
