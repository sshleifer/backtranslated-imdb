My sister, dad and I are really in D&D, and one night we surf Netflix looking for a movie to see when this one came up. We thought we would try it and I almost ended up dying of laughter. The printer and the action in this movie are so amazing! Witty characters, great interaction and hilarious moments kept us stuck all the time. I love this movie! It may not make much sense to those who don't know Dungeons & Dragons, but it's a good movie. This only shows that movies do not need an astronomical budget and big name actors / actresses to be successful. Check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.
