Penelope Spheeris (of "Wayne's World" fame) made her documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization" about the LA punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s. Most of the documentaries include interviews with punks and recordings of concerts (which often become violent). Overall, we will see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies were natural, the punkers wanted to have as much change as possible, what about nail hair and everything. But also, we see how they really get dissatisfied and sometimes become skin skin. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a really good time capsule. We are not quite sure if we want to long after the era or feel discouraged by it. But it is certainly not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Really worth seeing.
