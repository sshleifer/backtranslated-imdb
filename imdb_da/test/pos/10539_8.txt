What does it mean that people expect in Horror movies these days anyway. Is must be something grisly like 'SAW' or it's just crap ... ??? Now I do not claim to be an expert, but I am about 47, I have seen and literally own thousands of movies, and I honestly believe that this director really gave this movie a good and sincere effort. Believe me, I was ready to call as soon as the dialogue started, ASSUMING it would be terrible and I was pleasantly surprised. There is no Mamet script, that's for sure; but come on !!! with all the HORRIBLE waste out there, especially in Horror, I thought that one was way closer to the top of the pile than most. <br /> <br /> The director used many fine and clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of movie. Editing and timing were very good. And it didn't take off in the tired, worn cliché of excessive "slasher" violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During a lovely and totally free (but tasty ..., uh, I mean tasteful) nude shower scene, I fully expect her to be sliced ​​and crossed; but FANTASTIC, we just get to enjoy her heavenly legality and that's it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also the excitement was built very well, which leads to a nicely ambiguous conclusion where you are not entirely sure what is what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see the doll actually speaking to her, but in the video recording we do not. The mother also sees that Pinnochio is moving around and is quite wild; then both mother and daughter are mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original "killer" and what the mother had suggested about a possible evil influence. But even with all that, we are still not quite sure who killed ***** END SPOILER ***** So overall, I think it was a good, strong and sincere effort to create some good ol 'Early Full Moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence. And without any typical SLEAZE thrown in without reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower room that I will remember at the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drive out there, a DEFINIT, strong 8 / 10 !!!
