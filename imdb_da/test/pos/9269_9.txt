I went into "The Closer She Gets" knowing it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very demanding, depressing movie. And although the subject is definitely emotionally scary, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total commitment to meeting the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to lose faith in each other even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most moving moments for me are when this belief is revealed. Little comments that mother and family make to each other, revealing her (and their) will to survive, and their incredible emphasis on love and family relationships. In this way, it is an uplifting and deeply hoping movie. We should all be lucky enough to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.
