In connection with subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very intimate installment. The most notable feature of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it was a kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so smart and so effective is the fact that no one in any other way has to communicate, everyone must read each other based on intuition and dissemination, no matter how small. Although I was not glued to the screen, I look for reflection that it is a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. Its vehicle is the stylized sci-fi movie. Part of its reflection on the nature of human world is that every one of its people does not necessarily play as a perfect human: The hero, a lonely driver in the desolate new world, is taken by an older cave who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky, brutal character played by Jean Reno, and therefore, Reno tries everything he can, mostly using brutal force, to get what he wants. So the antagonist is right, but not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, even though they are both good people. It's shot in a clear and sharp black and white, edited and captured in a low key yet spry and small scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? Those, as their characters, are left with the mere necessities of communication. This is one of the few really good movies that Luc Besson has written. His previous work is almost always better than the fluff he is fighting out now.
