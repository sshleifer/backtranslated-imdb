I own this movie. I'm actually from the same city as the chief executives. But that doesn't make the movie better. But if one night you will see something not serious and not have and high expectations, I highly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny. But it contains key elements in a horror / comedy. I just want to see some small town children making a movie full of effects. And I say "bravo" to the Campell brothers. They now make several movies and continue a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help them start a good career with a good future.
