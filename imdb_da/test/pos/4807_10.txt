Having seen 'only' about 200 Hong Kong movies in my time, I have to say that this movie is among my most popular favorites. Not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising, which these days is rare for any movie), but chemistry between the two main actors is amazing. Top heel casting! And even though the most serious HK films often often put a bit of humor in between all drama and action, often the mood spoils a little, here the jokes become subtle and woven into the plot and even improved character. The music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of HK Special Edition, they even cleaned the image (the first release was grainy) and the subtitles, although the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all, if you are going to see a HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or has Chow Yun Fat in it, it should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!
