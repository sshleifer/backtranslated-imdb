Here is a well-built war history, nicely shot and well-acted. The exhibition of the Italian and German coatings on the Greek island of Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and beer doctor is amazing, Nicolas Cage does a good job as captain of the title, Penelope Cruz does a great job of being beautiful and turning his eyelashes on Cage. There is heroism and humor that is drama and romance, and it is all on an idyllic island. Strangely enough, a very similar or should I say almost identical, story, with the same characters going through The same series of events is told in a novel of the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of Doctor Iannis, and their life on Cephalonia during World War II. Pelagia's fianc√©, local fisherman Mandras, calls on the Italian army to invade northern Greece from Albania under false neglect. When the Axis finally wins, with great help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a major role in keeping the occupation peaceful. As Mandras goes with the partisans, charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartet with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. It does, of course, a novel about love. But it is also a war story, a summary of Greek history, a tale of communist insurgency in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's insanity and most importantly a desolation for the life of the Cephalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these items return to the movie, but generally it's an impossible book to film. I'm glad no one has ever tried. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book * after * you see the movie.
