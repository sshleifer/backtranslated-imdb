In the late 60's, Sergio Corbucci produced four spaghetti westerns in a row - the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS, and COMPANEROS. Three of these, all except the SPECIALISTER, constantly turn up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are classified. Until recently, everything I had seen was a very poor compilation with some English, some Italian, a fuzzy picture, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages), I can certainly include the SPECIALISTS in the group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as the charismatic skin, a notorious hand with the gun, returning to Blackstone to investigate his brother's death, which was lynched by the townspeople to lose their savings. It involves a well-functioning beauty that owns the bank, a Mexican bandit leader, El Diablo, who once was friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies - yes that was the late sixties, and hippies were everywhere, even apparently in our western. It's not a desert western, shot in the Alps somewhere, and is great to watch. There is a little more nudity than I expect in a western one, but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is lovely as Sheba, who can be Hud's niece or dead brother's boyfriend ... it's never been clear. This movie deserves to be seen, and again, we ask for a nice DVD with all the trimmings - I think the SPECIALISTS would be as well known as any of Corbuci's other westerners, and it is indeed much praise.
