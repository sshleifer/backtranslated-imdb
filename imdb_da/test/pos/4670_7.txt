Not the movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want a lot of fun, the theater is the same. Lots of snappy banter (and some really cheesy banter too). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as comic relief. Exciting and creative withdrawals and hunting scenes. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are appealing drivers. And Donald Sutherland!
