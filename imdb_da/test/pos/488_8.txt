The real state of life of an innocent first-time chief (the Indian) of a Winnipeg city officer (Cowboy) is the basis of this television movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The human rights of the former people are becoming a staple in the Canadian biological diet. What makes this movie worth seeing is the focus of family reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness, and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have less, almost cameo, looks. Quick-to-weather star Eric Schweig makes his mark in this movie with a powerful performance. An honorable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk who has chalked up over 100 films for his credit. His depiction of the troubled soul inspector Dowson was worth a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy) along with Eric Schweig. The special effects (cuts, dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing. Couple this with some beautiful North Canadian landscapes and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like Neil Stonechild's case, and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.
