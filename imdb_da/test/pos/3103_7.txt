The movie begins with a sharp old Broadway producer (exceptionally well played by veteran actor Richard Carle) run by a man who hopes to sell him a story for a forthcoming game. However, there is a bad storm and their car is stuck in the mud and they are forced to look for a place to stay. Fortunately, there is a mansion nearby, although it seems rather strange that the people inside know the author, and he says he was not aware that this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). But while this seems like bad and constructed writing, it is not .... as it is all part of a deeper rote of the author to get a group of actors in the home to act out of his plot. However, the manufacturer and his browbeaten assistant find that the mystery of the murder in the home is false and believes that the whole affair is quite fun. What no one understands, however, is that a fleeting lunatic is loose, and he is entering this clever little plot - making some wonderful twists. So when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are really scared while Carle and his sidekick are convinced that it's all a hoax. While I have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the movie, you just need to find out about yourself - and it is certainly keeping you entertained and guessing. Given that this is a B movie in the public domain, I certainly did not have very high expectations for this little movie. However, I was thrilled when the movie turned out to be a lot better than the average flick - with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich√© plot of a dark and stormy night in a mansion. Plus, while the plotting of the movie was very good, the dialogue was even better - with lots of sparkling white and a good light-hearted pace. Full of pleasant surprises and worth your time.
