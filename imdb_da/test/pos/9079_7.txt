Someone I know said that there was this movie called flatliners that was probably on my way. I was told about this movie after finally seeing Destination 2 and looking at the extra feature about near this experience. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds. Come home and watch it. And I couldn't help smiling and feeling good about how this movie hadn't been in my life before. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see how it is after near death experience. But then sin comes back in reality and can harm them physically. From Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland are great as you would expect from the couple. And Joel Schmacheur made it a great movie that he did with the lost boys. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting and stylish thriller that is bound to please, not the type of movie fan.
