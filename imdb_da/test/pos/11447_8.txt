Night of the Demons (1988) was another in a series of "teen" horror movies released on video and pay-t.v. during this mecca of movies do the eighties. But, unlike most of the crap that was peddled around, this was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teens" decide to party Halloween night away with a couple of bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an average teen bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive the Halloween night when the undead residents of Hull House decide to break down the party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A nice horror movie that is best seen in the unreported version. If you see the R-rated cut then you will miss all the splatter effects and nudity. Stick to the entertaining epilogue! A gory movie followed by an equally entertaining sequel. For only horror fans! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
