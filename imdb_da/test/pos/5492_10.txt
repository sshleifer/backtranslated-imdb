One of the finest movies I've seen ... Good script, original plot of a man haunted by JFK's murder when he was awarded to protect him on the cold November day in 1963. 30 years later another anti- social lunatic murdered the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way, to the crazy armed men who arrange, lie and murder someone on his way, who is in his mission. <br /> <br /> The movie accompanies a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood .... showing how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great, sure that many other candidates could have played the role he played, but how many could have dealt with such agony and intellect as he showed in the movie? <br /> <br /> It was superfluous that I thought it was a great movie ... every time it is on television, I have to watch it ... and I own it on DVD! I am a great Eastwood fan, this has only increased his already fantastic career and Malchovich's best role to date! <br /> <br />
