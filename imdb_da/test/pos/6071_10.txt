I have heard a horrible lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what the whole ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic joy and should I repeat that "should" always be seen with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral devotee, I fear this is not a movie for you, as you will not see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece, as you will continue to exploit the moral dilemmas created by this film . As I remember correctly before I watched this movie, I read the review on this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of the person I quoted, "said the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got". When it comes to morals, I agree with him, but that's not the way to comment on a movie of this glory. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have rarely seen such a wonderful movie. I continue to hear the background path in my subconscious. First of all, it is a love story, and yes it is an extramarital affair (moralists take care), but let's not continue to focus on it. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It is a mix of flashbacks and the present. Its set in World War II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes), imitated by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in the warlord of Italy just before the beginning of end (defeat of axis forces). It burns hereditary patient a lot in pain by remembering the horrible affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks in pre-war Africa. The past and present are interwoven so adroitly in history that you are kind of transported in history and get the feel of a first-hand viewer. The sites in the desert and in Italy are beautiful, and so are the signs. I am a romantic and not ashamed to say that I had tears after finishing. See it with someone you really love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert, where the dunes leash and curves like a woman's body, and it was breathtaking. The feeling of loss and grief was transferred so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why God! Why do we have wars that destroy the beauty and the most unforgivable for all, the destruction of innocence. <br /> <br /> Yet, it deserved a bunch of Oscars, and I want to hunt for other works by Director Anthony Minghella. That kind of thing brings the romance back into the movie David Lean. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing people.
