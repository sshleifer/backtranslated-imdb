Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is pausing in his professional life, his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally comes to leave him, and Ted is to look after their five-year-old son, Justin Henry. Being a single parent turns out to be right for Ted, and he suffers professionally, but also learns that there is much more to life than a career as he continues to associate with and truly learn to know his own son. But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, which leads to a cruel custody. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs Kramer is a fantastic well-written and wonderfully acted human drama that will only leave the coldest hearted a seer untouched. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed, and the movie never makes an easy way out. It always feels really right, and thanks to the movie's key feature makes it even more influential and can easily work on multiple views, but the dramatic impact of the movie doesn't diminish. <br /> <br /> Easily recommended; 10 out of 10
