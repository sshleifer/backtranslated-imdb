This is a documentary film unlike any other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it all at once is almost impossible. Documentarian William Greaves shows us the process of film making from a different perspective. We see the actors, the director, the sound staff and everyone else trying to hang in and make this movie successful. If only a movie is made, it would be commonplace. What Greaves does is make it more complex by having a crew film the actors, and then this will be filmed by another crew, only to get another crew movie the whole grip. Three cameras, each with a different target. It has an almost dizzying influence on you, but at the same time it is exciting. I like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what is going on. Even they are a little in the dark what Greaves is trying to do. The half is seen as an experiment, while the other half sees it as chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you can't argue that Greaves doesn't get you involved in this process.
