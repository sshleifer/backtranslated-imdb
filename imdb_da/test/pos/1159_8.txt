Writer / Director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a great adventure story showing two of its stars in memorable, greater than life roles: Sean Connery as the sly Arabian sheikh with an inexplicable Scottish brogue and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching the chance to put the "big stick" for good use. <br /> <br /> Supported immeasurably by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen filmography and a magnificent score of the ever-reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed to be a talent for ranking with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg. Although Milius made an exciting glimpse of his ability to write to Jeremiah Johnson and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to take a downward turn not long after he began to lead, and ultimately settled on CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /> <br /> Here he hopes he will find his way again.
