After seeing this routine of John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is such a talent. I enjoy great stage work, and this is stage work at its best. I can't feel it as a stand-up routine because Leguizamo is so intense when playing the various characters. The only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part, making it so much fun that one cannot help but appreciate his talents. I wasn't really sure how I felt about him as an actor, but the Freak solidified my appreciation for him. For those out there who haven't had the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Check it for sure. It's one of the ready routines I've ever seen. Ranks with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
