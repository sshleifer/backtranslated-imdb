exquisite !! In simple words, both the Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other quite well, or maybe they are just too good. It can only be her best performance as an actor and the best of the Aparas as an instructor. yes maybe better than Mr and Mrs iyer. The concerto plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's (Konona Sen) eldest sister. Shabana Azmi made the most of Anjali's character because she had to play a strong responsible, arrogant role as an older sister who had full responsibility for her family. The monkeys Sen have beautifully crafted Anjali character, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. Mithi's behavior was not young at all, because you can expect this from most Indian leaders for this role. Looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of mithi, a schizophrenic. When sometimes Mithi is a normal, sweet college go girl, she also scares you when she gets sick .. Both sides have been beautifully convicted and the game .. believe me sometimes reminds you of the girl in Exorcist .. the scary though .. Overall. Remarkable work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
