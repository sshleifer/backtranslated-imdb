This is undoubtedly the most exciting and satisfying movie I've seen this year! The plot seen in print is almost banal - a ship crashes on a desert plane with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and each other, so the darkness and monsters fall. Pilot free, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere, when she almost passenger passengers, took charge of the group and assists the convicted killer Riddick to guide them through the darkness to the escape ship - he is the surgically-enhanced eye that can see in the dark. But it's really not that simple - each character is complex, three-dimensional, with contradictory features, so you never know who is good, and who is bad. The performances are uniformly excellent - Radha Mitchell shows Hairdresser herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back in custody, shows that he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the movie belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen this year. Too much of the movie is his face in shade, and he doesn't actually say much, but he does point out the same. Sometimes he draws attention by not talking - or by not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as it could so easily be done by giving him a "heart of gold" - Riddick is still a medieval and vicious man as they approach the ship. He just lets us see the first interim steps from wont only caring for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very good. The light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and tone darkness. Special effects showing both Riddick's and Monster's views add excitement, as well as sound effects from monsters flying and using ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and appropriately scary). Editing is so tight, it is almost crushing at times - there is literally no padding in this movie, no fading, no time to reorient yourself. <br /> <br /> From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep you witnessed. Each scene, every line of dialogue, every camera is shot important. See it three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only warning is about science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets are about suns, not vice versa). But it does not affect human history, so I have not taken points.
