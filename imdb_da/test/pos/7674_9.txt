I got the solo "Summertime" in 5th grade for our spring choir concert. From that time, a great gratitude arose for Gershwin's music in me. I love the thrilling tunes of this opera by Gershwin. Back when I was in 5th grade (about 10 years), I got the LP to practice and also love the soundtrack a lot. I recommend watching this movie and if you can get the soundtrack get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - an old, used LP. I have searched and searched to try to find the audio track on cd. The songs on this have great musical events, and I really want it to be put on CD for purchase and also want them to restore the movie and put it on DVD. This really is a good job, which I think contemporary and future generations would enjoy and enjoy. Some may think the movie slowly and dull, but I find it quite the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed musical voices, I think the voices fit well with the faces and personalities. A person's speaking voice and voice can be quite different. Porgy and Bess, and the songs in this opera, will always have a special meaning to me.
