I saw The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue to see anything, and the film was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well-made and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But that was the story, and it is delivery that really made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight scripts were just what this evening of "shorts" needed. Nor did it disappear as more offers made or served us. The reader was simple story telling in the best shape, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted. Duncan Rogers is, of course, a director with the ability to put all pieces together, I'm looking forward to his next finished project. K.
