Right after moving into her new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot gets an invitation for dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large manor house nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is near the pool, and his clumsy wife holds a revolver a few steps away .... This Agatha Christie mystery is somewhat thin, although the killer plan is still very clever. It is the exquisite film and film that raises the story to a higher level. This episode mostly holds the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. The piece may include the two most famous actors who have worked in the series at this time, Edward Fox (as butler) and Sarah Miles (like Lady Angkatell), although the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as the front Henrietta: Her one-on-one confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the movie. Oh, and since an English police inspector gets involved in the case, I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back to this one. (***)
