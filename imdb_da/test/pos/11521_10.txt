I must say that this movie had a great cast, places, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was amazing, she had a very exciting roll, very rebellious, while Jordana Brewster had a serious role but still caught one. for me Jordana is very nostalgic, she reminds me of a female classmate of mine! What really got me into this movie was the highly skilled camera work and choice of placements. The story is very talent written. It is a must see one. Anyone who is in the mystery movie should look at this, I guarantee you everything that will keep you in your seats to the end.
