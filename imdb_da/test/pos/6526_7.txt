A £ 3.50 DVD can be a gamble and it was kind of paid. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday Night-type movie that entertains if you shine on the obvious plot errors. Special effects are slightly few and far between with some repetitions (and why does London always look like it is in the 60s?) If it had the budget, Armageddon says I am sure it would have worked better at Box Office then The story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Tycus is shipped for B movie story but if you see it for £ 3.50 then it's worth buying.
