Okay, okay, I have to admit, I do something like Peter Liapis, and I admit that this is not the best Ghoule's successor. I mean, yes, it had its faults as no GHOULIES themselves. But the two ghoulies coming to earth were really funny, I suppose they were called, Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the movie, both Ghoulies led to a sequel. Still waiting. laugh out loud. Peter Liapis reprized his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, how sweet! Ghoulies IV must not be scary or exciting, but it is definitely fun. I thought I would comment on this movie and just say - it's not that bad. It's worth seeing even though Ghoulies isn't in it.
