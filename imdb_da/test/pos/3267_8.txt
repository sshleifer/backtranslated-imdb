Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, after the desperate attempt of nineteen-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger) who ties a job to a local gangster and needs to make changes before they come to him. The gangsters (led by Bryan Brown) are a threatening crowd with a humorous touch in them. That's what makes the movie work because we always see mobsters as a rough mass to screw you hard. But this mob also source your funny leg. A cleverly structured script from Jordan has characters that cross paths and become trapped in the web plot.
