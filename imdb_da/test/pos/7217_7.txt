I found it really shocking to first see William Shakespeare's love masterpiece reworked into a gory, violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation. But after you see it once, it grows on you when you see it in the second and third time when you come across the shock and begin to appreciate the movie on its own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, good sequencing and choreography, not-for-bad soundtracks and some of the (special) effects going on. Oh, and also the end. What a rebellion!
