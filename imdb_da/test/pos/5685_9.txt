I live here in the crown area and well remember the true events that inspired this movie. Our gut falls out every time we hear about a hook attack. BLACK WATER is simply the best croc movie I've ever seen. While I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and splashed scenes, it was the local scenes that caught our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything else. BLACK WATER, but really resonated with annoyance and fear that you may experience when you are alone in the mangroves (you call them swamp or bayous - but they are mangroves). Each tourist should watch this movie before going to the northern territory. The end was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the movie, but I will add this to my DVD collection when it becomes available.
