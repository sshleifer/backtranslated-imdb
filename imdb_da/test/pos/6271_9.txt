This movie, Blade Master, can be cheap, clumsy in appearance, and sometimes, but it shares thoughts of problems far beyond the time this movie is put in. Ator is the chosen one to protect the earth against a terrible weapon that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the nuclear weapon. He goes through obstacles as a witty character, which is only more than muscle power, though he has quite a lot. I would say that this aspect of the movie makes it better than a movie like Conan, the barbaric, which is the least I can say, totally brain free. It in no way diminishes the great adventure film that is Conan, but it gives Ator its sweetness that he does not share with the barbarian. For a lower budget film, this movie is good in attitude and the games are most credible. Zor, the villain, is captivated throughout the film with one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that cause tensions to the movie, though Ator seems too appropriate for the task of losing. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie the little extra is the scenes that can look quirky but worth mentioning. The battle with the snake god, even though he is a gigantic doll, is handled well as the snake, with good lightning, remains a silhouette, and the battle is quite convincing. The film climaxes in an unusual way, quite anachronically, but breathtaking: the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself has not been introduced correctly, does not read at all, where did Ator get the machine it is quite convincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, which alone is the culminating point of the film that raises Ator in a place how few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not one of the amazing amazing movies from all the time, it is not surprising because of its shortcomings, it is a major surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart shows that this film is so carefree. I suggest it to every fan of the genre and try to take it seriously as an intelligent movie that needs to be taken more seriously than it seems.
