I really liked this movie, though this movie seems to be so hated, and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, who was overstated. Both this movie and the Year Of The Dragon are very underrated, though I could see why someone didn't like this movie. In three and a half hours, the film goes just too long, and the other half of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert, but she can't figure out what to do. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed, who say are anarchists and twenty. There's a big cast that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
