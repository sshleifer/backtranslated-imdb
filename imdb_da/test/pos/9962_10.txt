My guide to the quality of a movie is if I still think about it after leaving the theater. I'm still thinking of this the next day, which doesn't happen often. Nature (a reasonable guess for 16th century Italy), costumes, lighting, filmography are all good. It's a beautiful movie visually. Characters can never get over the script that they have to recite, but these actors have made the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeare's best plays that people will still enjoy 400 years down the road. All the main characters were interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Those who say this are anti-Semitic, must be deaf and blind. If that's something, it's anti-Venetian-16th century Catholic. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the evil he has suffered, it is clear that the society he is living in is largely due. The script clearly places its personal responsibility where it also belongs. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
