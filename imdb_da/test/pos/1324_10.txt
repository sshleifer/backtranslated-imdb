One would think that a movie based on the Japanese author Yukio Mishima's life would be a daunting, if not impossible, task. But Paul Schrader has actually made a movie "about" Mishima, which is both fantastic and complex. Although not a literal biography, Schrader and his writer Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several events from his life, including his success and created what can best be described as random taboos that are visually sparse and amazing. Mishima's homosexuality is hardly there because of his widow's legal threats, but in spite of this, the movie is still great and one of the best movies I saw in 1985. I also have to mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who did the score, which adds an extra texture to the film and is better than the one he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also noteworthy is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored filmography and the great production design and costumes of Eiko Ishioka, which continued to make the memorable costumes for Coppolas Dracula, which she received a well-deserved Oscar. Hopefully this movie will soon be available on DVD.
