This movie gives us some other world war history along with some touching romance, a little imagination and meaningful feeling - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again it does a good job. And so do the other principles. A key charater, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some of the events are a little too random to be real, but I apologized for knowing that this is partial adventure and fantasy. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's nice to see people take the risk of loving the enemy. A man who left the theater near us said to his wife: "Now is the way to war!" I think you will see what he thinks when you see the Italian occupiers on this lovely Greek island.
