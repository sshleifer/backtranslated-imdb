This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girl friend or family. Basically, one of them feels good movies that you will share with your loved ones .... without all the clever crap you find in a lot of American feel good movies. This movie is light hearted but makes you think and makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a really simple but universal plot. Would think most people could relate to this movie in a way. The characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a good job of sucking you into the movie. And the movie is topped off all the way with hilarious true to life Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night, and now I want to own it. :)
