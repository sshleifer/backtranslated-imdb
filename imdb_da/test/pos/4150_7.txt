This movie promises a lot but delivers a little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not in any way need a red-haired Anglo - the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion, the decision to include her damages the film's continuity. This is particularly troubling, as it does not only seem the characters in the film, but also the actual immigration history. Immigrants themselves were heroic characters, fully capable of coming together without having to satisfy what I believe to be a blurry picture of "the white man's burden". I wonder if anyone wants to make a movie of Irish immigrants that will include a Sicilian woman as a great character. The left elbow index considers seven aspects of film-acting, production set, dialogue, art, film continuity, plot and character development - on a scale of no more than 10 to excellent, 5 on average, and 1 for help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity discussed above is further degraded by the surreal end. Don't deserve a movie of such important historical significance more than a conclusion reminiscent of a Marc Chagall? The reason is simple enough until it seems to be rooted in too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the finish. The play and character development is average, as all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the English-speaking perfect English almost makes the movie a satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogue and the artwork are very good, each rating a 10. The seats in Sicily, on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is amazing and the ethical song is amazing. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that immigrants talk about "America", not "USA" - the ideal of political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, gold coins raining and huge vegetables among the best. The average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equal to the IMDb scale. Another concept seems to run through the Ellis Island experience: Troubles for passport immigrants were cruel, later in 2006, one had to pay only a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county at night, no questions asked! The movie is worth seeing, but it seems that what you see is problematic.
