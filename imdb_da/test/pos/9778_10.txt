This should be one of Australia's best productions. I totally disagree with the comments from 'RamiNour101'. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of Australian mateship and the lengths they went to help each other out. Episode Five 'Eddie's Birthday' is a good example of this, and it really captures the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only emphasized the situation facing the men, their longing for home and their loved ones. The many entertaining reproductions of The Road to Gundagai capture the spirit of men and the fact that they never forgot the home and that it was small elements like the song of a song that took them home for a short while. <br /> <br /> As far as the comment about being racist towards Japanese people is concerned, the only thing you have to say is that you can't change what happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very badly in Changi and represent what would otherwise be very misleading. The commentary on the manuscript is in exact is also false. These six stories, told in the series, are composed of genuine P.O.W experiences. <br /> <br /> The actors were amazing; The best thing is, in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was intestinal. From being a city boy to being another nameless face to her prisoners. We see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of The first to help the other members of The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is fantastic, going from the group's larch to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. The Mateship shows in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be Australian. <br /> <br /> I study World War II at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
