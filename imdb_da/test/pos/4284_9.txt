There are so many more complexities to the plot of this wonderful thought-provoking film than merely adultery and uncovering responsibility for the accident. I was hit by the original apparent goodness of man Wilkinson who wanted the driver when he thought it was Everett, was revealed to the police, and the change of heart (and morality) when he learned it was his wife. Also he was really good and / or he tried to redeem himself by letting her go with Rupert. Then, things switched and SHE decided the right thing to do was admit she hit him. Most important is the subject of redemption (for the accident - for adultery - in its own odd, mistaken way) strongest in Watson's nurse for Everett. So I think she did the job. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, End of Affair comes to mind. Love it.
