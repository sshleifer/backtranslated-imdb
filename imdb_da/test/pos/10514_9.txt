I was never so impressed with the Night Gallery, but this one episode stands out. <br /> <br /> A television network executive auditions an odd action - a young, nerdy boy who continues to forecast. Exec rejects the whole thing as a flat waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning. <br /> <br /> The first one seemed that a children's law becomes a hit show, as the child's predictions are consistently correct. <Br /> <br /> One day he refuses to perform the show. Unlike imminent show time, everyone is at their end and even threatens him with lawsuits if he does not fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions. The young boy is relieved and predicts a seemingly utopian morning. <p> <p> br /> <br /> After the show, the befuddled executive asks for an explanation, only to learn why the complete truth is too scary to reveal.
