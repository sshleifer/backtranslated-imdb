I'm not American, but meatballs still hit me. Maybe because it's a cute, sweet movie. Seeing it again today made me sentimental for a time, I can't really put my finger on and a place I can't remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a good movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really matters and everything is possible. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably know what I mean. All I can say on top of what I have already said is that meatballs should be even more nostalgic if you are American. I think you know what I mean by that too.
