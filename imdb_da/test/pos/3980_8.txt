This is what movies should strive for. Fun without being completely stupid, a little sexy without having every woman thrown, showing her breasts and bites without resorting to "f-bombs" every single line. I've seen Justin Long pop up in many movies over the last few years, I figured out the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials do not resist.) This movie can just put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the player also did their job perfectly, it is an excellent little movie with a nice message. (But you don't have to buy the message for good.) Lewis Black is as usual fun, and Blake Lively is a fresh beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and watch this movie, they won't be wasted.
