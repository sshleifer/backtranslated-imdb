15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is looking for from the beginning of the movie. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half-sister from Mithi's mother's earlier marriage. The film is about these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. <br /> <br /> The condom does not deserve one, but thousands of prizes (which I am sure she will get) for this reproduction of Mithi in this movie. You can see the appearance of a patient written on her face, by the hanging lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. Rahul Bose has done a good job but has been reduced to half of the film despite his importance in their lives. Look for the intense relationships shown between the movie's characters, Mithi & Anu, Anu & Anu's Mom and between Anu & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, has made a tremendous performance to be remembered as the sister who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The movie may not be your usual Hindi pot boiler, but can certainly make people look at schizophrenic patients in a completely different hero. <br /> <br /> As usual, the Aparna Sen brings the film to a different end than any clich√©s we might think of. Hats out to her for this amazing movie !!!
