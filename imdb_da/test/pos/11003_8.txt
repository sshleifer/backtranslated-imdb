An appropriate description of Spock by an omnipotent kid in whose clutches falls the company's crew. This was an area of ​​space that our starship should have avoided: first, Sulu & Kirk simply disappeared from the bridge; A landing party follows them on the surface of an unknown planet and encounters Trelane, an apparently aristocratic man dressed in dress from a land of many centuries past. But he demonstrates the abilities of someone or something far beyond man and does not record on McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers are able to escape back to the ship, but Trelane holds up as a small cosmic ear. He brings them all back, including some female companions, to continue his game. The dilemma now takes the elements of 'The Dangerous Game' into space, and there is an exciting, even unpleasant, aspect to the crew's complete helplessness before such a monstrous force. What really makes this a good episode is the memorable performance of the Campbell guest star as the overwhelming but not all-knowing alien. His character is, of course, an early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in pilot for the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange dramas unfolding. Kirk, as usual, begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being completely unmatched. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us all the time, so when we learn the truth, it is quite sensible in the light of Campbell's theatrical play. He devotes himself all the time and characterizes something unknown to the public and notices things with a flair that is contagious, but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down first, but something is missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes scary, and the crew now seems to be in serious danger. In a way, you can't take his eyes off and always wait to see what he's doing next. Actor John de Lancie captured the same tone as Q on the Next Generation series.
