Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid and just developed a taste for the exotic cigarettes while living in a squat on Manchester's Moss Side, with the most incredible case of cockroach attack. <br /> <br /> After a couple of these doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I will look down on the floor (or up the walls or almost anywhere) and see my own collection of "little armadillos" scuttling about. <br /> <br /> Not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but I remember thinking about the time when the obvious surrealism of the show was amazing - that was my second favorite thing on TV at that time (# 1 was season for Luis Bunuel films shown by Channel 4). Radical art lives on! <br /> <br /> You also need the theme melody! .... I swear I will never drink anymore.
