Under Clete Robert's foreword, I began to think this was an Ed Wood production, but what rolls out here is some pretty hard-hit stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a southern city is told by a cast iron cast from Hollywood's poverty line, making it more realistic. There are no battles drawn here, and sometimes it reminds of "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives a fresh quality. Confidently, younger viewers will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project", but this is based on REAL events!
