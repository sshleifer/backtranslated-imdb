I think this is one of Burt's top five films along with Deliverance, Smokey and Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also instructed this so he had a talent for it as well as his friend Clint Eastwood. I wish he made more movies like this or even a sequel to Sharky's Machine than similar to Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a hard, gritty cop thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having the beautiful Rachel Ward in the Thorn Birds fame also helped. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does well. The movie is also a good soundtrack as well. I highly recommend this, wish it was on DVD in the UK, an audio comment from Reynolds would also be great. *** 7/10 ***
