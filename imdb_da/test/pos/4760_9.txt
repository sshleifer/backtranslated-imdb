He plays straight, but with a silent intensity that makes him one of the top policemen in film history. Roy Scheider stars in a poor man's French connection, which has a bit of the same gritty appeal. FC is a better movie, but I prefer to watch this one because 1) I think Scheider is great, and that's his best movie, and 2) this has the best car chase, EVER, one that makes Bullitt a cable production (thanks again to Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver). It doesn't hurt that Tony LoBianco stops at (again) to play a baddie. Please enjoy.
