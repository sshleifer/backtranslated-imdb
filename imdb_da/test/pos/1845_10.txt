I have to admit that I didn't come around to watch this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer-free season, this cute little movie couldn't help but get a little lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it? <br /> <br /> "Return to Me" has a nice and simple story in its core and is extremely well run and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of great images as an actress himself ....) along with this! Charming story is beautifully woven with smart comedy and brought to life with excellent performances by both veteran and younger actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say David Duchovny hasn't really had a good shot breaking out of his "Fox Mulder" mold, I agree. I have seen his second film work and is by far the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, fun and lively in her role as Grace. Outside these two leaders, however, you are surrounded by Grace's close family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute nail, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force. However, I cannot go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggia and the dear departure of Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I watched this movie again on the DVD only the day before he died. This was his last movie, and he gave a notion that an actor of his caliber could probably be proud to leave as the finals for a good career. All in all, "Return To Me" turned what would have still been a fun love story and grew it into a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time to rent it here ..... it's worth doing!
