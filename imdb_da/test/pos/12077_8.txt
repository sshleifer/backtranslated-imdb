I still lived with my parents when they sent this on Dutch television. Normally I was the one watching movies with the other who didn't care. But somehow we all sat and watched this movie. This kind of movie was used to be broadcast on Wednesday night. It's the story of a woman who wants to die soon. But before she dies, she will make sure that her (many) children get the best possible foster parents. So we saw this and my father (the most emotional of the four of us) started crying. I followed almost immediately and for too long my sister and mother were also torn up. There we were completely moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is for you!
