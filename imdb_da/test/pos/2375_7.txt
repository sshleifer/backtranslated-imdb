Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi movie that nods reluctantly to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and anime at once. The robots are actually called "replicas", a reference to Dick's Blade Runner (more visual protrusions for the movie also exist) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor who is obsessed with limiting generation using a mandatory "heterosexual love is fleeting , and gay love is eternal ".... martial arts fighting ensue, a first for the dead or live movies. The hilarious climax involves the two leaders who morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus to a head that personifies "destruction" which has been the path of both characters so far, their individual minds and later literal heads act like testicles . The movie ends with the mayor of his free jazz boy boyeyey, as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them, the mayor's last word "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick fade to black. Part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I was just laughing. Much of the movie is quite boring, but the best scenes book the movie, while the rest are far too slow. Takashi Miike has always used the sexual motives during men's violence in action movies, and this movie with the exception of "Gozu" enhances this theme more than anyone else. Gender and violence are two rather basic themes, but like Cronerberg (who jazz interludes can be a tribute to ala Naked Lunch), Miike can show where the two connect, to a fun, a strange coherent effect.
