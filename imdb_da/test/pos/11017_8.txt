Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best movie I've seen. But I can't describe the way the movie made me feel while I watched it and how I felt when it ended and also how I feel about it now. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I don't. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it can remind us of something or it can instill fear or fun etc ... this movie had me in not the best mood. In fact, it made me feel empty in some way. I guess because the lives of these two people were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with and I think having to get away from what could not have been a good life. But in that way it really only got worse. A stable fall from where it started. It was boring as it was so well-acted, and I suppose we've probably seen someone in a situation that somehow resembles the situation these people were in. They could have had a good life if they had an idea of ​​how. But Wes was clear, they didn't know what to do. So they kind of Rambled to a place they had heard of. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that was set for them. I felt bad, but couldn't stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I don't like if only someone played the parts. These two did a good job to the point you just didn't see the actor. I am very impressed and would like to buy the movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It left me feeling a bit like leaving Los Vegas did. But again it is in a class itself. Not a good movie, but well worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person having problems, I would not suggest you see it. It could depress you. It depressed me and I didn't have the conditions these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
