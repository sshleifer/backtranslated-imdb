This is an absolutely masterful stroke by Paul Thomas Anderson, who is the author / director of this movie. It really examines the puzzles and minuses of the porn world and the consequences for your actions living in a world that is literally driven by sex, drugs and rock n roll. Only some of the finest casts come together with Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall and others.
