Okay, I marked this spoiler, so don't be sorry when I unpack it. Now I went into the movie and expect to see a very predictable movie. And it was right, as almost all horror flicks I've ever seen were predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I didn't expect to be a "why" to Kane's madness. But there was and while something foggy, you still got the idea and understood the madness. Now of course, if you like something that will scare you for nights to come, it's not the movie you're looking for. But if your fan of Saw, or some other movies claiming their fame thanks to sadistic content, it's a movie to watch. Now that I really throw a spoiler for another warning. I give this movie a 9 maybe because I'm a fan of WWE and a fan of Kane, but who doesn't like a movie a little better when the star someone we love. But this movie could have scored a 10 for me IF. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when it showed Kane dead on the pavement. While a dog pissed in the eye, "CUTE" could have been classic with Kane / Undertaker quickly sitting up and turning his head. A perfect 10 would have been assigned if it had happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but either WWE did not think about it, or a future successor will begin with the right order I mentioned. That's all. (9)
