Okay. Here's the case. I've read through comments from other viewers --- some trash movie and some say it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's still an enjoyable and ultimately fun movie. Not brilliant, not trash can. Liv Tyler gives a good performance and you can definitely not take her eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorative ideas ... Matt Dillon, a highly underrated and under-used actor, is wonderful as ever. He always manages to pursue the delicate line between scruff and soul, and he beautifully draws the comedy. Ditto John Goodman (although the religious overtones, probably funny in the script, really doesn't work). Paul Reiser is very good --- certainly better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> The normally unbearable Michael Douglas is actually great in this role. As for his coif, yes, see the movie. Between this and the "Wonder Boys", you are actually reminded that Douglas can act. The movie makes you laugh in parts. Okay, not exactly belly-laughing, but certainly in the entertained-I'm very entertained category. If you rent this expect to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something sweet hip and a little fun, this is a damn good choice.
