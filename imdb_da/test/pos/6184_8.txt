This movie appeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s when they made a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, in the tune "The Jolly Fat Policeman", they had a montage of scenes from the movies to introduce the series of people laughing, including one by Gary Cooper, shorter when watching movies in a movie house - a sequence from this movie. It all starts innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, enters a fancy department store in France to buy pajamas. But he only likes sleeping in tops. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists he can't sell a pair of pajamas that Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes sleeping in the pajamas. What if Brooke sells them every half? Brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if it can be done. He is also disturbed - the request is rather unconventional. Eventually they contact the shop owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and goes out - his thin frame only supports a pajama mat (if appropriate for censorship). Can they sell the two customers a set of pajamas (half for each)? Halton rightly replied, "No, it's not! It's Communism !!". So sales are not allowed. Apparently, nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the whole couple and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE has had a reputation for falling flat, most viewers don't like it due to a misprint of Colber's character. She is considered a mercenary to Cooper - sells to him on his terms. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cooper's character is nastier as he is rich and figurative that everything has a price. He is correct most of the time. In this way, Colbert's aristocratic successor, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper is willing to marry Colbert somehow concluding that if he is hesitant or chooses not to marry her, he must pay compensation. Horton, when he understands this, takes a watch and says (in a most calming voice) to Cooper: "Take your time my boy!" To come to a decision. Later, we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and more advanced. <br /> <br /> The movie, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compare well with their script to Mitchell Leys MIDNIGHT (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There is Colbert willing to sell himself to a cash marriage with (to Francis Lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver), but she explains to him in an unexpected realistic moment that her parents "married for love", but poverty made them grow to hate each other. This is not found in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert does not have such a background (she is a daughter of a Marquis). Her mercenary plotting is to teach Cooper a lesson on his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has a good job of the support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye that turns out to hide things that Colbert teaches and a young David Niven who has a set of options like stand in the shock bag and as a willing ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how she is so annoying. Niven respectfully listens. At the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Asks Cooper. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shakes his head), "That's fair!"
