The sign of Pain is easily one of the best cinema pieces I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes that have been released so far: <br /> Section 1 was even better than I had expected, and everything I had heard about it, I expected a lot. I'm very impressed with the actors already. The father was scary and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such feelings. The animation was excellent. The cinematography was amazing, every camera angle captured the feel of the scene perfectly. The editing was done so well that each scene blended seamlessly into the next. The music caught the emotions quite well and pulled you into the story. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely beats my appetite for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I said about the first episode is going through, only you get to see even more of the character development. I can't wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series for that matter. What evolves is an exciting, character-driven story with all the trappings of a great Hollywood production, but without pretension. So much is said with so few words. This series is something you've never seen and bred to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other word describe it! WOW! All I have said about the previous episodes applies to this one and yet it was even better! I don't know how you can take something amazing and make it even better! The further character development shows that this is a completely characterized piece of piece. The cinematography stands out as it always has and draws you into Emily's pain, fear, hatred, and emotional roller coaster. I can't wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series for that matter. You've really left yourself! <br /> <br /> As much as I have loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best yet. I love the character progression. I really want to know Emily, her pain, and her inner struggle. The other themes I have mentioned in previous reviews continue. GREAT filmography, the writing is amazing, the actors are just about their depictions and have made their characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! Another good job from the DbP crew!
