Luchino Visconti has become famous for the world after its wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film fans got to know the director's style, which introduced itself as one of the new warring realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and consequently expressed them as an artist. But when applied to this movie, MORTE A VENEZIA based on Thomas Mann's novel, it is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the entire movie is so unique, so psychologically and so much influenced by an artist's various thoughts (both director and protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems to be "unmatched" for many viewers. Therefore, such opinions stood on the film as "too slow", "infinite" or "infinite boredom". Why? The reason seems to be to a large extent today: "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLELY TO FLAWLESS ACTION." Here it would be appropriate to say, "Good movie is parallel to no action." In fact, everyone could say a sentence about the entire movie's content, and that would suffice. Everything we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality filled with both depth and depth, which seems to be essential for each moment's sake. And that's how we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice when we see Gustav at the railway station when we are provided with his intense emotional memories. Insight into his past due mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to continue watching the movie is to make his / her best feel and experience rather than see and think. Everything is doomed to fade, to fade like flowers on meadow when their time comes. In other words, everyone has a feeling of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of ​​the movie after a single show. It should be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. If you like it or not ... it's another story, very personal. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​are the factor that can be seen at first sight and remain with us throughout. Beauty as something very meaningful to the protagonist who seems to come and leave; resting as something he is going to so badly and coming to him in the most unexpected way; feels that he finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all dreams and desires as a forbidden fruit of gay desire that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a great job in this movie. Through lots of wonderful wardrobe he delivers us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. Cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis gives us a fantastic visual experience that can be called a real party for the eyes. And in the background comes Gustav Mahler's music, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are top notch, especially from Dirk Bogart as protagonist, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants a rest after hard artistic work and in vain tries to find it in crowded Venice. For most of the film, we have a good insight into his thoughts, feelings and deeds of anger, exhaustion, and despair. Although he sometimes depresses, he keeps us on the right track until the end does not lose hope for the less tragic end. Tadzio (Bjørn Andersen) portrays the model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that seems to remain beautifully short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was too short," says the protagonist. A great, but very controversial, job is done by Mark Burns as a kind of "super ego" Alfred, with whom Gustav polemic about such ideals as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How freudian, however, how dangerous the idea could be! And always present in artistic Italian film of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio's mother. In fact, memorable moments are the strong points of the film; Nevertheless, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, like the unequal film, require a great deal of effort to get in the right direction in the director's individual ego and within his four-walled psyche. Among these scenes, I consider the beach sequence quite important, especially the way Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance represents exactly the lack of getting closer. I also appreciate the shots when Gustav sits in the gondola, and the city's point of view moves in the background - how strange it can raise existential thoughts of transfer. Are we not humans, a kind of "passers-by" in the world, on the journey that life is. In the end, I have to tell you an important thing. I had found MORTE A VENEZIA very strange until I started looking deeper at what the director really is trying to convey. Then each scene appeared to be meaningful in its interpretation that you do not need to agree with (I hardly agree with anything the protagonist does), but at least you should tolerate this as something the author would otherwise say . Listen to his voice, let him get a few words on one side of reality ... That's why there is a long way to understanding the movie, as not many movies were made in 1971 and are being made now. Paradoxically, it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this movie in the long run in the same way that we are all bound to experience a strange, inevitable, usually unexpected reality, that death is ... 7/10
