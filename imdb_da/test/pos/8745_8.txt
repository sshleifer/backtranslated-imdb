I've read countless reviews that talk about the superiority of the mini series. I certainly cannot agree with such a carpet inventory. If you analyze all aspects of a video / movie production, there are numerous areas where the movie is probably much better. <br /> <br /> Obviously, many of the comments are valid with respect to particular areas of mini-series. Especially for more threads (customs officials) and more developed threads (such as Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones' character much more convincing as the desperate women, from poverty to wealth, who "will not go back." It is a much more sympathetic character than the cold women who did not seem to have so many reasons why she could quickly turn to the evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children. She was desperate, I just didn't see her as desperate.) <br /> <br /> Further, while I appreciated some of the more elaborate stories in the mini series, Benicio was del Toro's character very convincing. An anchor for the movie. This thread was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in no but good ways. A great fit. (Of course, I am skeptical that there may be someone so clean in such a system, but I do not know enough about the nation's policy of arguing). After watching the first episode of the mini series, I actually rewatched the movie. Why? I continued to read about the amazing play. I found the performances in the miniseries first episode to be borderline ridiculous. Obviously, this is improved as the miniseries progress. Now I have just finished both versions in a few days, I cannot agree that the mini-series performance reached the level of Benicio del Toro, which was brilliant in the movie, though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan was very good. I also feel the police in the film far less than the miniseries. I was not impressed with the Germans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue provided in the movie is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes that are almost verbatim. "Carefully, you start to sound like your husband." unlike "HAHAHAHA! You sound like Karl." Again, I found some of the trades in the miniseries very convincing. This was a good example. Other superior aspects of the movie, in my opinion: score, filmography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie was no longer? No. I think it was a great fit given the format. The changes made were alone. I mean, you would sit in a theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini Series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 out of 10
