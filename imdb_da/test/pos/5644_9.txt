I got the movie out a week after Ichikawa's death - I guess if there is a way to mark the transition to a great instructor, raising a glass of wine for him while watching one of his biggest movies. Ichikawa had one of the finest careers in Japanese film, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seems to be overlooked compared to his closest contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was slightly younger than them, but not much ). He is one of the directors who speaks author theories - it is likely that his wife (who wrote this manuscript and many others of his films) was just as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at best he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker at the time. He especially had good technical skills which enabled him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme, this movie could hardly be simpler - war is hell. Not really, it's seriously hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the Plain does not follow the normal war genre rules. There is no real beginning - we begin as the miserable Tamura, who is a regular private (although it is understood that he is more caring and educated than most others - at one point it is shown that he understands English, but he meets when the others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to the hospital as his unit is already in a terrible state. The soldiers are defeated and starving to death. They are no longer an army, just a rag bag of refugees - chased by the locals, and largely ignored by the Americans who have bigger fish to roast. Hunger and despair drive the soldiers to the edge and beyond madness. In typical Ichikawa style, it's not just ugly - it's oddly fun in parts (a very black humor of course). <Br /> <br /> The high points of this movie for me are the excellent performances of the leaders and the living photography. The characters, throughout their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are far too credible. It's the rare movie - one that will refuse to delete itself from your head even if you will forget it.
