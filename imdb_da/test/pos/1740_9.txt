First I never got into Dr. Who until recently. In fact, I have never had the opportunity to see any of the previous incarnations (sayings calculated) as it was never "big" here in the United States, as it is everywhere. <br /> <br /> That said, of course I have to say that after finishing 2nd season, this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I see a lot of Sci-Fi shows throughout and this show stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was great. Of course, it was also the lovely Billie Piper who just added such humanity and warmth to the character of Rose that no one could have done better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky, who is just a blast to see. Then there is David Tenannt. At first I thought he was too gawky-looking to play the character (his ears !!), but after seeing the second season, he just fits in nicely. His sharp plays and physical comedy are almost flawless. He is great with a chat dialogue and can become serious without throwing an eye. Apart from the great play from the cast, the play of most of the guest actors has emerged. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and are marvelous. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show are top notch. Occasionally there will be some cheesy effects here and there, but it has always been a factor in the original series, and these episodes are insignificant. My favorite thing about everything about the series: The Stories. Writing people is always the key to good entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written many of the episodes with a few other writers, and they have done an excellent job. They have managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with wise concepts and great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can break the stories and enemies of the older doctors of the past well (my friend explains a lot of this to me while we watch the show) and respectfully. <br /> <br /> I won't mention everything about the second season and how it ends since the Sci-Fi channel just started flying the second season. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to ruin it. It's so much fun and excitement. You will never take your eyes off or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to Nicholas Briggs's back producers! **ERADICATE!**
