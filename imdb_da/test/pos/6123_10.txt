I grew up in Baltimore so I was exposed to John Waters movie when I was too young to see them. And if you are familiar with John Waters, are limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby or other family-friendly movies, then prepare for Pink Flamingos. Explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unhygienic actions with chickens are just part of something of depravity in this movie. The movie ends with Divine, Waters' 300 lbs. crime star eating dog cloth. <br /> <br /> The premise is about two families: A pair of inbred trailer waste, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the wife; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families compete for the title "Filthiest person alive." Enjoy John Waters finest movie, but only see it if you are an open-minded person with a strong stomach because some scenes in this movie will break you out.
