Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" in a very favorable light. <br /> <br /> It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian film commentator and critic named Bill, who was known for his insight and broad vision of people & places and especially of movies. This film fitted Bill perfectly and I appreciated his commentary and enthusiasm for this movie, which became more and more like what I saw when I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute beyond his initial comments on my first impression many many years ago. <br /> <br /> For me it was propelled, layer by layer, within half an hour for an exciting and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of its error! But it was so enticing ?? The idealistic young man learns from and inspired by his father ?? the farmer treated as nonsense in his suffering ?? The opportunistic friend, however, flawless but still loved by his friend, the central character Sinute ?? And for a safe, flawless hero too, as so many people across humanity of all societies and everywhere all the time but loving and dignified love too! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but I also acknowledge the rights and respects of any good-hearted person who will not or will not respect his fellow human beings without justice. As such, I support this film and its presentation of a man of good heart and conviction in his belief in the sun god he was devoted to. Such people will always be welcome in my worldview and hopefully in many more than. <br /> <br /> Also, the drama of the subsequent film I have seen often as surely as it has touched my heart and soul, as surely as it seems to have confused critics in his time. It is captivating and looks at the love of the struggle and sorrow and soul, the doctor! When I see it again, I am always reminded of my friend in heart Bill, the film critic who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who rubbished it. He added criticism for too many critics ?? that they make statues to honor stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues in honor of critics! And apart from all this, I am reminded of every view of a SUPERB & TOUCHING play of a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not only relevant to the 1950s or some time ago. It was the meaning for you and me in time and place for all people and women and their personal desires for love and freedom, and to overcome obstacles to misunderstandings and gross injustice and tragedy that attract them with a single belief in many religions that it works for many considerations as the cause of war! Take an evening out of invitations or unfair violence, from bigotry & judgmental attacks to others unfairly executed and consider the benefits of this offer. Not for sun god or for power that turns out to be so manageable. Let this outstanding movie wash over you like waves on a beach that the passing hands on time ?? as life was supposed to be. And maybe you will find yourself worn in its world of possibilities! Lost offers no more! 9.9 out of 10!
