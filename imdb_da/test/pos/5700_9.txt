What a wonderful documentary - I sat down and thought that this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in Easy Riders, the Raging Bulls, but it is actually a clear and brilliant celebration of a strange and twisted era that created some really good movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness shown by director interviews as the movie film industry is now sucking in a big way - instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola's eyes seem to be positively glittering reminiscent of their glory. The recording of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was invaluable. "It was - traumatic," one guy says. A great epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wished it was longer - I could have sat through a three hour slice of this.
