Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget about Sunday morning. Motion pictures are works of art that hold onto you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. These are the kind of things that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual peice of movies that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of making a straight look at Yukio Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader brings together three adaptations of the author's stories to a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese military in rebellion in the name of the emperor. If he does not, he commits ritual suicide at an end that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three card historical adaptations give a look at what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear as movie recordings. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he comes out as very sympathetic, a man who is completely willing to die for his faith and do. This makes the end so much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. Of the three story adaptations, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses, it is the last one that is the strongest and most emotional. It is also the story that best suits Mishima's mood in his last years and illustrates what really led him to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without mentioning Philip Glass's striking musical score. Not since 2001, a movie score has been a perfect compliment to its images. Paul Schrader made one of the most beautiful films from the 1980s or any decade for that matter. Have hankies ready because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: A life of four chapters reminds you that movies can sometimes still be an art form and as art is brilliant.
