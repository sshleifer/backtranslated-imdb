Zachary Scott does what he does best, ie. plays a worm, in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B movie starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lamb from his last murder he rents a room in the home belonging to the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws herself at Emerson, and she's blinded. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left her $ 25,000 (big bucks after 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and makes a game for Anne. Anne resembles Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking with Scott - overnight, she turns 10 and even gets crazy about her sister. Finally, the message that her tenants are not good and Hilda calls in a Rosemary DeCamp gets to piss him out and advise her. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after World War II, and Scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. This was his forte - as a weak-willed sheriff in "Flamingo Road" he showed no real presence. In terms of two-timing, we saw him do it in "Mildred Pierce", where he proved particularly good at it. Emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed out of her face and her big glasses, but after hours she is lovely and gives a strong performance. DeCamp was always an underestimated actress - here she sports a soft German accent and is lovely. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, though a very routine story. The actor really raises it.
