Despite all the comparisons to the House of Frankenstein, this film erodes its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster movies in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately the last one. Okay. so it's not quite up to something like Bride of Frankenstein as a classic to be honored by fans of all movies, but with a throw of Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster (What? No mummy?) you can 'I help but enjoy this schlock party! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact much more. But this movie also offers some unique story lines for both Dracula and Wolf Man, who both go to Dr. Adleman for healing their ailments. While Wolf actually finds a cure, Dracula injects the blood into the doctor, and that's when the right fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
