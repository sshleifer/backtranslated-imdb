With some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, excellently designed and executed set, Nightbreed is a great movie. Unfortunately, a well-known leading actor lacks the leadership to find the movie's darkness. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps even the director's homosexuality causes the film to be unevenly censored by the white audience that the film decorates. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is a treasure of the monster movie / superhero genre. <br /> <br /> A sequel to Highlander style flashbacks for various eras in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the foundation of the new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or the Lousiana swamps with crocodile men and a busy freak circus.
