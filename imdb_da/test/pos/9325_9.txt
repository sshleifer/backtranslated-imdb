When it was announced that "King of Pop" was dead at the age of 50, a month before starting a series of live comeback shows at London's O2 Arena, it was a huge shock to millions of people worldwide. He was and will always be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry and he will be terribly missed. I decided to remind myself how wonderful he was looking at what is considered many to be not just Jackson's best video (and possibly song), but the greatest music video ever made by director John Landis (an American werewolf in London). The film opens with Michael and his girl (Ola Ray) who have their break, and after she has got a ring, the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf. We see Michael and his girl watching this horror movie in the cinema, she is scared and going out, and Michael follows her quickly and sings the iconic song. Soon enough, Vincent Price's voice and zombies begin to crawl out the earth and open chests from the cemetery, and Michael and the girl are naturally surrounded by. She turns away and Michael has become a zombie himself, and with all the other creatures they make the iconic dance before returning to his normal self, at least for the choir. The girl runs into the scary house, blocks the doorway, but zombie Michael still manages to break through, and when he touches her, she screams to see normal Michael says "what's the problem?" The movie ends with him and takes her home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons, and he was number 6 at The Ultimate Pop Star, the Thriller album was number 4 on the 100 largest albums, and this video was number 71 on the 100 biggest scary moments and it was number 1 on the 100 biggest pop videos. Very good!
