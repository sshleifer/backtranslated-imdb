I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It's really quite fun. There are certainly a few laughs that my boyfriend and I quote to each other. Some of the situations may be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange child's view of sexuality) but credible at the same time. It is about communication and miscommunication between men and women.
