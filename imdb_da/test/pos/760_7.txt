I had never heard of this movie before I came across it when I was reading the shelves at a local rental store. Having just looked at the latest Harry Potter submission, I was fascinated by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. When you read the description on the back of "a sumptuous evangelical Christian idol" and identify as an evangelical Christian, I thought to myself, "Oooh, it must be interesting." And then it was. I found Mr Brock's story beautiful in both words and pictures; and, unfortunately, all too familiar. The contrast he made between Ben's parents' interpretation of what it means to be a Christian was a sharp comment on how Christians see themselves and the influence that perception has on them around them. On the one hand, we have Ben's mother who says, "Whatever happens behind those walls, Ben, we are God's ambassadors. We show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Bens father discusses the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says: "The more a person parades their Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I tend to rely on Christianity they claim. God tells us true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. how you express it, the way, the way, the means at your disposal, these things have no consequences, be you christian or atheist unless you are true to your heart. "If only our churches were full of christians attributed to the last definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus, rather than the former. What a difference it would make! As a Christian and a psychologist, I would like to have an imperfect but authentic belief in a perfectly polished image every day. What tragedy? to feel that I always need to play a role when I really have to rest in the freedom to be complete, as God made me to be. I think Mr. Brock gives a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in Christ looks like. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a new look at the faith.
