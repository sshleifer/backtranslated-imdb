Gilmore girls are about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live as sisters. Share everything, trust each other completely. <br /> <br /> I like The Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. The mother named Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter, Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both fun and they are charming in their own ways. There are some fun supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai as each can even love each other, but none of them really works. They have their little moments. There are some other supporting characters, most of them very funny and with their ignorant moments. What I like most about, I think, is seeing the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who becomes an adult. The dialogue between them is quick, sharp, fun and sometimes touching. The band they have is beautiful. Gilmore Girls make you good so try it.
