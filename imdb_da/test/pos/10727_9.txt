If you asked me to choose the best recorded movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's Streetcar Named Desire. I imagine I will discover some others who qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is an excellent naturalism exercise. So it is a very satisfying experience at this level: just seeing the amazing exploratory performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the baby Justin Henry in particular. One of the best children's shows ever. <br /> <br /> But I also find it very satisfying to look at because it is such a thorough involvement story - it always makes me forget my own problems. It has such excellent storytelling. Keeping Kramer vs Kramer and Alice Kramer leaving Ted to juggle work and their young son, tells him no more than to discover herself - you are watching to know that everything is in order for them. And even when you know how things go out, every moment of the trip just rings so brilliantly that it's a joy to see it happen again and again. Don't Make a Mistake - Kramer vs. Kramer is not light entertainment: it is a very realistic depiction of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman that were going through a divorce at that time) ever written, executed, and performed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what a great, involved story it is. Simply, a perfect movie.
