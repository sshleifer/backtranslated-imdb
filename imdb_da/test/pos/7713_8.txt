The eighth, and hence the second short of the Animatrix dams, is the only one that looks like this. This takes two of the most important types of movie-inspired inspiration from The Matrix, combining them incredibly well. This is incredibly true to the trilogy of that aspect. The animation is a beautiful, breathtaking animation. The style, which is ubiquitous in this, is Noir. The reason is appropriate, and the story of history, as well as the music, is spot-on. The sound in general is fantastic, and really helps to solidify the mood and atmosphere with the drawings and the designers. The voice action is impeccable. This is one of only two, where people in the movies also represent their roles, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one in this. This is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites. It's about ten minutes long. The pacing is perfect. It never terribly slows down, but it is not overwhelming either. The conclusion could not have been more appropriate for this. This shares a minute and a half with the Kid's Story, and it's well done and informative. I highly recommend it to any fan of the universe and the two genres of which it is composed. 8.10
