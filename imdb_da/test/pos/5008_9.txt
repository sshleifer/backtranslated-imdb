This show was a pleasant surprise after seeing Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host that you can tell, still get used to it, but he does good adaptation to his new job. I can imagine it being a difficult transition from the author (Seinfeld) to host, but unlike many new talk show hosts, he does not let the listening time run while trying to figure out what to do next time . He is quick-set and each segment and section rolls into each other evenly. It also doesn't hurt that he's a little sexy in a nerdy way, so he's not hard on his eyes like Leno or Letterman. I can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite, but I especially loved the Idiot Paparazzi filthy with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great New Show !!
