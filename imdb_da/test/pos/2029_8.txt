What to say about a movie like Rock Star? Very actually! This is the type of movie that is almost tailored to the critics of slamming. It is also a movie I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan, enjoyed-not-loved indeed - while constantly consciously aware of his many mistakes and that of the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance to escape in grandeur and become a rock movie classic. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie - and wanted to see it again and again - but I know it's based solely on my own taste. Rock Star is a movie that appeals to anyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a good time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures it (long forgotten by many non-rock fans.) Time efficiently, as I think Rock Star has done. It is one of the film's strengths, the concert recording. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love it? Regarding the atmosphere of the Rock Star, a 10 out of 10. It also gets a 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go free flow into some good memories of good times earlier, then it's the movie for you. That's also why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a good movie. I understand it, and if it were my real job to browse movies professionally, I would probably have a little trouble with this. The problem with the Rock star is the character development. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with character development is this, there is none. None. The movie has some scenes - few and far between, but they are there - that bring greatness: WARNING SHORT SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples - 1) when Izzy makes his debut on stage (including the case he takes) <br /> <br / > 2) The first "after show" party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) Backtracking a little - in the beginning, when the original lead singer is dismissed (fired) whole "business as usual" tone sets the stage for what is to come. It is played very efficiently. <br /> <br /> But the problem is, nothing ever comes. There is little or no sign development of anyone in this movie, the people's personas are only affected but never fully explored. I don't think it's the actor's / actor's fault, especially Anniston, who is trying hard, they just don't get much to work with. It was just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formal" feeling in true film depth. The rock star was so sugarcoated at times (including at the end) it was almost ridiculous. And although the scenes I mentioned were excellent and very credible, unfortunately, much else in the movie was not. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of structure towards the end and I agree, but there was actually a lack of structure. Why does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of credibility. And honestly the end was just corny. It was not meant, and it was not at all a reality. <br /> <br /> It looks almost like watching a movie where decision makers say: OK, this happens every now and then, and so on, etc. etc. In the end, it is no longer a movie about a boy whose dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail has been omitted. <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not hard on Rock Star because I really loved it - but not for the right reasons. I would have loved this as a great movie about the heights and the decline of rock fame. Instead, I loved it because it was the 80-year-old feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life .... Although many others loved it, I suppose most are people who lived the life of a rock fan as I did or some playing. I would have liked to watch the film cross over and just be respected for being a good, well-liked film, rather than a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. I myself hate over long movies, but it was someone who really should have been longer if a movie is made really right, the length is not even felt. There is just too much for the story because it is as short as it was - it is a reason why there doesn't seem to be a big evolution of the story or the people depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> So to knock down - it's a movie you can get into - but not a good movie. Watch it for fun. Watch it for entertainment. See it to go back to the big, big room in time when metal was not only a part of life, it was life - and for the non-rock fans - watch it for a little insight into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.
