This is one of the films the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or the Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier when he outwits and outfoxes the Navy to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as worm as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sex pot, though with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as fun as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderfully intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I see it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, but this is a small obstacle to the accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
