In fact, I have a question more than a comment. I loved Z-Boys and The Dogs of Dogtown. Lawyer first, saw doctor, and while I loved the story, I'm curious why in the movie Sid was an important character, but in the documentary, he was not part of the team, and only mentioned only as a child they knew. Does anyone know the story of it? The story of these boys was amazing. I've never experienced skateboarding craze where I grew up, but my kids have had it. What I've seen in local skate parks is what those boys had invented. I never knew that. When the film showed the competition and Z-Boys did their thing, they argued the others in the competition.
