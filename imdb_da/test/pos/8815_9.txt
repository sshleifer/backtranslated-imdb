This movie was fun. It gave a little comical picture of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a fun thing. The characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who looked here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of pivotal scenes that really made this movie work: clear scenes; "Get me a real doctor" scene; the white background scene shows each character in a total state of being destroyed, ending with the infamous line "what did I say?" and comedown sunup scenes. I have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing in my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to Groove, which I thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments. The Mise-en-scene and camera work are great, the special effects are worth mentioning, and the play is amazing. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to watch this movie, I am happy to say that I was not disappointed I hope to see more from the author / director in the future.
