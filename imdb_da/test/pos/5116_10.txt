I love Ernest going to jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite Ernest movies. The others are Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Camp. In this movie, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a caretaker for a bank, but he wants to be a banker. Soon he will be awarded a jury fee, but soon it will be in trouble when the evil killer Felix Nash (Varney also) knocks him out and changes places with him! Soon, Ernest is in prison and forced to act as Nash or else Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair, thinking he is Nash, he gets electrocuted, he wins and goes out and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with fun scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Prison is a movie that makes you laugh so hard! It still makes me! Jim Varney was such a great actress! He did a good job with both good guy and bad guy! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. Whatever role they played their roles were memorabilia, and that is one of the things that Varney will remember forever! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thanks for bringing Ernest and other amazing characters to life! 10 out of 10!
