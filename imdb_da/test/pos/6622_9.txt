My skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-four-skateboard with steel roller skate wheels hit a stone and I tumbled, for days it seemed, down the sidewalk outside my parent's home in Boston. When the kick came from my arm, the summer was gone. <br /> <br /> But I have always admired X game types and surfers especially. I think I spent the first month after moving to Southern California on the beaches and piercing and looking at the surfers, lamenting the fact that I had missed my call. These are the kinds of things you need to teach young people before the awful senses of self-preservation and self-awareness that go in. Or at best you will be so worried about not getting hurt or laughing, you will open up like a trained bear. I always admired how a good surfer seems to care about anything but the moment, the wave, the experience. On one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but to wave right there and how you interact with it. There is a lot of Zen in it for me. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how a few young people took the surfing concepts and expanded them into skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, make welding curves while interacting with the cement waves below their feet. In their time and time it was brand new. radical. Prior to the Zephyr Skate team, the idea was apparently going as fast as possible in a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" tumbled down. <br /> <br /> This movie is a glance back through time, to an America, before ALT was labeled, labeled, marketed, and jam-forced into our throats as "Extreme." (Seriously, what is so extreme about an extreme value in Taco Bell? Except for the fact that it is an extreme danger to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and watch the birth of " extreme sport '. Before there was an X game before the Boom boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before ASA ... there were those young street chickens who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. They just did it for purity, the sheer pleasure that skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they get a piece of the "extreme" money out there. Goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can correct it. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie with a good soundtrack, a portrait of southern California, actually an America that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I don't care about Sean Penn, but he does a decent job telling.
