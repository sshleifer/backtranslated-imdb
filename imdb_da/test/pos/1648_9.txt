Shtrafbat is the story that only Russians could tell about the Second World War. The biggest advance of the entire conflict has been ironically the least occurring item on the silver screen after the war. While western Allied war efforts have been depicted in almost every possible detail and way, the East has been omitted, or the job has been left to only some old propaganda films with little more than historical record value. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with the Band of Brothers in every detail, but neither would you look at the screen to examine petty visuals in mind. The fact that the soldiers are Russians is another great reason to forgive the less eye-catching battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is most interesting. So much different was the war on the eastern front and the nature of the Russian army that you might want people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is no way perfect, but it has some rare specialties that enhance overall rating. It tends to crush myths that people have about World War II, the true heroes were Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only be lost. Another great myth is that it presents the enemy who does not assemble his gun like an equal person - a progress that has been difficult to try in many recognized films. Shtrafbat shows how the war on the eastern front was a war for survival, and how the collapse of -ism strikes people in dust.
