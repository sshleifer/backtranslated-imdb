I still remember seeing Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different, so from the other Gangster movies I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so trustworthy. Despite the "Company" (which was a very good bet) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the protagonist's journey) coming close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I saw Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I told myself "Indian Cops have their own" Satya "now". Quote from Nietzsche in the beginning tells you that this is no ordinary movie. What strikes you about the "meeting" at the beginning of the movie is the relaxed way it is performed. There is a cold and scary sense of it because you realize it's part of their routine. Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest policeman or a corrupt policeman, but of a policeman ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all legal means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. Editing seems non-existent and thus effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you leave the movie hall. <br /> <br /> But for me, that's what really takes the cake, the dialogues, and the overall action of every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as a dialogue writer. If I start to record my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I will end up rewriting the whole movie in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie boasts some star performances. Yashpal Sharma is abhorrent as sub-inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and it is Jeeva as joint commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitate to shoot the injured gangster? Oh God! He teaches under Sadhu Aghashes leadership and believes firmly on him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare like Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are true jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian film has any movie brought such a beautiful connection between a policeman and a gangster. <br /> <br /> Not that I haven't been a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie shot me from a fan to a devotion. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he speaks to his expression, from the way he taps his cigarette to the road sips his tea ?? It's almost as if Nana can't do anything wrong. He's the best in every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin about how the police force works. His cool and complex way of doing things is sometimes frightening. His dialogue delivery and body language had convinced me that he is one of the finest actors in the country. It's a pity he didn't win any popular prizes for this one. Last but by no means does Shimit Amin do a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and making full use of it with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is boringly used to lifting stories here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treat. I just hope he continues the great work and does not give in to Bollywood isation! If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to count on in the years to come.
