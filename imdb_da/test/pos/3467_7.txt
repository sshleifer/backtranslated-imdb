I went to pre-screening of "Rory O'Shea was here." I like this movie better than I had expected because of its excellent throwing and powerful performance. It is a film about friendship for two disabled young men. Rory is a free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I think it's enough to start with a crying drama. Well, that's it. But with inspirational messages and deep moving ideas. It made me look at my life for things I take for granted. What would I do if all I can do is move my two fingers? I should be grateful for what I have and what I can do. This is a good flick, although it could have been better.
