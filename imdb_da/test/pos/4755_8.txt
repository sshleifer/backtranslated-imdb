Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, solid in a lead role) leads a secret undercover police force called the seven-ups whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact ways the law provides. They get the job done in their own way, without anything leaking to the press, and it gives them the freedom to expand their means to get to the criminal most active detectives and the policeman just can't neighbors. Buddy has a childhood friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who provides information with him about mob types and shysters working in the streets of NYC. What Buddy does not know is that Vito cuts a scheme using names from Buddy's "checklist" (he has this book open and makes notes from Vito available, but does not know that his friend has copied the very names written in his mind) to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings that provoke money thanks to two cop-posers, Moon (the always villain Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this scheme goes wrong, with one of the seven ups being killed, Vito becomes awful because he knows how Buddy can be when he is doggedly after someone ... especially when one of his own is murdered. <br /> <br /> Extremely underrated cop flick has exciting car hunting through New York City as Buddy follows kidnap cop imposts trying to get them after killing his partner. The movie is not too complicated after the plot is created, and we realize who is the ringleader in the shame of mobsters. Scheider has never received the credit he deserves as a fine leading actor. He has emotional reach and we see how he loses his policeman and friend takes it on him. The movie is quickly paced with good action sequences and presents an interesting plot of betrayal between friends whose greed comes before childhoodhood and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree to evil mob families can get killed.
