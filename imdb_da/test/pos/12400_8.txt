Born Bad is a well-composed criminal drama about a group of teenage children. Teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining. The movie resembles The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage girls are walking around in their city and creating their own rules and not worrying about the consequences.
