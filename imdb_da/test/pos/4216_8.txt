It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series, which in my opinion is the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just amazing in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors coming to think of (Freddie Prince Jr. for one) and more fun than many comedies I've seen before. The reason was not great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other. And the end leaves it open for a 5th successor (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands premiere next week and seems to be another scare / comedy, but I doubt it will top it off.
