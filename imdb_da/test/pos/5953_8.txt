Jean Dujardin gets the Connerys manicures down pat: to adjust the cufflinks when entering a club, as all women turn to admire him, the blurred settlement and smoothing of the tie, the swaggering, steely going. It's scary, and you'll realize how much Bond in the 60's was Connery's creation and not really Ian Fleming's character. <br /> <br /> Kinematics is a nod to the early films, and the film takes off Russia with Love and Thunderball. The most important joke is how the chauvinist hero is, not only in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts his nose out when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - about 20 minutes in what looks like a one-joke movie and bits of it reminiscent of one of the spoofs of the day, which was plenty. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence But having suspected looking men in fez also follows their heroes and it goes back a bit. Unlike the salesman's Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat, Dujardin does not give his character the layer of reality or true patos - he is too busy to perfect his Connery way. It does not do enough with the credits or a great song, and there is no fun or serious villain like Mike Myers' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis for the hero to go up against. <br /> <br /> But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning sounded loud in the three-fourths empty cinema, and it all looks wonderful, and you never get the chance to watch Operation Kid Brother at The screen and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist / Ken Adam set or fun gadget routine. Totally recommended.
