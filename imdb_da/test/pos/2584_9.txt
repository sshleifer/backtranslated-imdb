I watched this movie at first view available in my area and it was quite clear that most didn't get the movie. Even if you do not, it is a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thorough human story of some very imperfect people in a southern city backwood, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you didn't. And no ... it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a good job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best including it because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the casting is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr as Reverend RL. I am a very selective movie guard, and this film is honestly among my favorites because of its sincere look at race, gender, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with the cinematic genius, in my opinion.
