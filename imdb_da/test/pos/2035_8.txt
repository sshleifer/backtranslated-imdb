ROCK STAR is a well-written Hollywood-style rendition of the story based on actually how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for the Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his fun charming fun and performed with credible admiration, something he has witnessed since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, no stranger to musical theme films, takes the audience through the wonders of breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, hair-metal rock god. Wahlberg's "Izzy" appears as the film's host playing everyman, who gets to see his wish become true. His equal character quickly wins over the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the hand drawn metal "goat horn" several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint with the story is that the support casting, namely the other members of the band, did not get rid of or even correctly introduced. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would have reinforced and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. Of course, ROCK STAR is full of great music. Rabin's score, Steel Dragon's original work and lots of 80's-style Metal hits make this soundtrack a must-have! Let us all hope that movies like Rock Star not only give credibility to a music style that helped define a generation, but also spark a much needed resurgence.
