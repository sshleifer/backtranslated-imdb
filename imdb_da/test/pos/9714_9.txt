It seems that everybody wants to jump on the band and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Spoken maa - ka ". .. <br /> <br /> I grew up with this series in the early 70s here in LA on the late and much regretted channel 56 ... Before that, there was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy) who dates from 1963 on ol 'KHJ TV. Astro Boy was the first television example of anime we came here in the states ... I was in anime as a child and followed it until the late 80s when it would be a series of badly animated "speech heads" A phenomenon that has only gotten worse. " Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As far as "Speed ​​Racer" is concerned, I really enjoyed the basics, the POV shoots, the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted for animation ... It was pretty typical of most Japanese anime since then ... Graphic graphic graphics! Take note of how the series was inspired by Stanley Kramer's film "Grand Prix" (1966), especially the redone American credits .... <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics that the series is based on, so I know which one I speak. <br /> <br /> What do we do animation-wise besides crap like Johnny Quest? ..... Th 'same ol' thing we had done since the 20s .... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I guess the real problem I had / had with the way anime was / is shown on US TV, is the hatchet job done on scripts, credits, etc. to "sanitize" them to US audience ... I don't want to go into other programs that we speak "Speed ​​here." Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here when he was 99% responsible for rewriting the series ... Not to mention the speed of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and goofs on Trans / Lux (Think Felix the Cat and Mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They took a beautiful, very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of Sesam Street. Think "Cruncher Bloch", "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I continue, I'll puke. <br /> <br /> This series dates from 40 years ago, but I know enough time to feel offended by dumbing down this and other Japanese programs ... I think it's obvious when someone gets 'killed, but they either remove it or shine it over ........ Pleeeeeze! <br /> Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the latest incarnations in the series have the CRAPPY "made in Korea" look, not to mention being uncomfortable "PC" in content. Even Japanese outsource their animation now. <br /> <br /> Try to see the original Japanese opening on YouTube once ... It sends chills on the back ..... If only ...... Oh well. Robert
