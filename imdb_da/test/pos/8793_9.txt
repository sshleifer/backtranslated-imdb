Well, let's say, "the only movie related to club / dj / electronic music and raves ... that ravers respect". <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It's a wonderfully fun, fast pace and pretty accurate portrayal of a robber's night. Although it is in a club, it is in Wales and its somewhat dated. The movie leaves some of the outline elements in club life, but does not completely distinguish them from them. It presents an idyllic yet serious depiction of the characters' ups and downs. <br /> <br /> The essence of the movie and the best feature of Justin Kerrigan's script are the characters, eccentric, unique but completely understandable and accessible. This movie simply wouldn't work and be infinitely less entertaining if it wasn't for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social consequences of the subtitles of Human Traffic as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabe, important point in British youth culture around the 90s, BUT .... they cannot deny that these are engaging characters. <Br /> <br /> It's hectic, it's brutally honest, it's sober, it's over the top, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex thing, so the drugs that are taken on these events are the people you will encounter. But from someone who's been partying, being jaded and still going ... Human traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken by the subculture. Whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its opposite to everything that is good with human traffic.
