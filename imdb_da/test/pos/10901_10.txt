Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this creepy tale of a mild way school teacher (Kevin Kline) at the Academy Awards by a former student-turn actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film is about the absurdities about this set-up - the impact on the city, his fiance (Joan Cusack), himself and the climaxes with an all-loved-all final. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for a precise portrayal of a man's struggle to get out or a "real" portrayal of gay life, save yourself the problem and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read a book (Giovanni's Room). If you are able to understand that this movie was inspired by Tom Hank's talk about the Academy Awards, when he won for Philadelphia and pokes fun in Hollywood culture and small town ignorance, and you have a feel for '30's screw-basketball comedy (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) So Enjoy! Far from being a biting satire, the film is trying to eradicate a Preston Sturges farce and is cursed. No, it's not "deep" or "powerful" - not even Romy & Michelle, 9 to 5 or Young Frankenstein - and it doesn't pretend to be; It holds the tongue firmly in the cheek. It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good towards the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit outdated (there is also a closet that could have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire, it is as a breath fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderful games while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add good support. The award-winning Joan Cusack's award-winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is good, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the city's mentality, the poker fun on; Personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime.
