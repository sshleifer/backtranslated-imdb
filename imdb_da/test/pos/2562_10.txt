In the beginning I was cut off by renting this movie because of the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, it was true with my friends who did not rent it because of the art and mental image (s) that it was a movie that had little or no interest in me (or my friends). But I rented and looked at it and was really amazed. I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone because of the obvious sexual consequences, so it is certainly not something I want young children to look at (and seriously doubt if they would understand it Nevertheless). I enjoy movies like this, where the character's personalities and who they are are really defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will prove to be bad. The action finished ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well I was drawn into this movie, not even realizing that they were acting. The same thing with the story ... may seem like something removed, but it was done so much, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or cumbersome, so was well-defined. <br /> <br /> I found much depth in this movie with the character involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be praised for a perfect fit / result. After watching this movie, I had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to seeing it as I did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and saw it. They were also quite surprised at how good it was. It is too bad that the art on the jacket was done as it was, as it is a trip. I can now see how art applies, but I hadn't heard of this movie before, and art was my first impression ... art selling or destroying DVD sales / rentals. <br /> <br /> These characters had more depth for them and good timing was assigned to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feeling" for each. I felt I could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. So with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.
