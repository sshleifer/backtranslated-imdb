"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well I blinked) It can be sad, fun or abusive. (Mostly addicting) "America's Next Top Model" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more of one channel. Sometimes it is on MTV other times, it is not. I hope it will be more fans and grow to be a hit series! It's great for just about any age so anyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> If you watched the show before, haven't you noticed that Tyra has another hair style every time in the courtroom? She gets it short and curly one week, and so long and just the next.
