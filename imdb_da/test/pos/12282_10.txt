loved the story of a guy trying to get his girl back .... been there, done it so i can relate ... in any way, i love the camera work, how occasionally the camera gets "left on" and they sit right there and talking about the scene or other things ... or how the camera follows him around to find the cast and what not ... i saw this at the IFC sometime last year and i loved it so i told a few of my friends about And some of them saw it and they also loved it. Check it out if you can, a little nice, but it's still a good movie ... I gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons ... one: I can relate ... but anyone who ever has fell in love and made a mistake, can relate ... two: it's a really creative way to make a movie, it's like you're constantly there, right in the movie ... as i said, great movie
