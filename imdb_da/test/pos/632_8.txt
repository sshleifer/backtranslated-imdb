I don't know how this movie went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, I ran through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well-filmed movie. I missed the first one, probably 10 minutes, but it doesn't matter .. this movie grabbed me, it's a real spine. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known actors in the film adds to the effect, you don't know what to expect from the actors because they are new. You never know when they are killed or what they are capable of. so it is the more exciting. Although there are many new faces, their performances were top notch. The film authorities play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to imagine the rest. The shock, the fear, the fear and the helplessness are also well-illustrated by characters in the film. The well-written situations n twists, fast camera movements, smooth editing and excellent direction make it an excellent thriller. This movie actually changes between the genre - horror and suspense thriller, which leaves the viewer clueless and excited. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks. I was the helpless MUTE WITNESS for this amazing movie.
