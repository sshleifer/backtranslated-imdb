At first glance, this movie looks like a kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significant white horse, once seen never forgotten. But seen strictly within the framework of history, the implication is to survive in the immediate post-civil war America, one had to have a horse and not an old horse, but one really big. And the eagle's wing is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The Native American or AWOL Soldier? History goes through primitivism towards civilization. As has been said by other commentators, it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact, and then develop this simple theme into a Western like no other you will ever see again. The film is basically about this animal and the hardness of the environment and the people who scrap it alive. The photography and soundtrack are exquisite. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as Sheen's second major achievement as Willard in 'Apocalypse Now', suggests his abilities which somehow were never again given such free clothing. More is sin. A comparison of the two stories throws the surprising similarities between them - not least that both films draw a man's journey into his soul to find redemption. Where Willard is redeemed, I'll leave it to the viewer to determine if Pike is finally. The ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving; Be warned. All in all, it's an extraordinary movie.
