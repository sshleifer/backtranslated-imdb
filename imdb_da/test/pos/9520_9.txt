Or at least you feel quite high after this movie. It is the kind of movie that the word "rollicking" can really apply to, even though it rolls in the relaxed, intelligent and open manner of the French. No, Catherine Deneuve does not use the whole movie aloud (sorry to disappoint any Puritan with an agenda) .. but the one scene I am referring to involves all the members of a wedding party - and that is a musical number! Still, everything fits together seamlessly, and the unusual, bright, colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve's vivant daughter) alternately entertaines and annoys us as real families do .. but as it is a movie, they mostly entertains. <br /> <br /> Not to say too much about the end, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about 20 years younger. This is completely credible as we see the relationship evolving over time, and since the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together. The end is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfying quirky as well as pitch-perfect.
