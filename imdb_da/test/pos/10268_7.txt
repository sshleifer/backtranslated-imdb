From today's point of view, it is quite ridiculous to judge this movie 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual but sublime, erotic story to tell, but the pictures are pretty innocent. Throughout the film, you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in fashion, dialogues, and typical experimental films and lighting. And that is precisely the part that makes it worth seeing.
