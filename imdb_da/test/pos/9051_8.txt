This 60 min movie shows just how much fun movie creation can be. It's all good fun, as it plays out without a no, which is prevented in comedy attacks on the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie" is a group of good boys on mission to stop a group of stripped cats out to destroy the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the scruffy Fluffy with the power of RSS Bovine and that's Cow Ray ?? She can have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (previously only seen on scifi conventions) is a party favorite. Lots of fun moments!
