omg !!! Did you ever think they would make a movie about it ?? well i knew they would, but i didn't know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when I received it yesterday through the post, I put it in my (bad) stereo playing DVDs and immediately had this huuuuuuuuuuge spark on my face when cloud appeared (looks good .... beautiful !!) and they followed of all the other fascinating characters from the last fantasy game! including tifa and aeris, my favorites .... (they are also beautiful in this) the graphics knocked me out !!!! they were truly amazing. so real down to the last hair !!! The storyline is OK a little confusing, especially since my version of the movie was in Japanese, but of course - being a long time finally fantasy fanatic - I didn't mind - I just read the subtitles !!! all the characters speak as they would in the game, and the reno and rude are still ridiculous. The dragon scene is also evil. just look so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were amazing .... the story, amazing .... and the basic idea of ​​even having a ff7 movie ....... genius !!!
