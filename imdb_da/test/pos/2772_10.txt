I love this movie. is it more in the air? what can i do to get it back on air because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? I love this movie so much. Does anyone know how long it has been since it was last at Disney? It has been a very long time and I am so sick to wait! I'd like to see Susie Q again. I swear they take all the good movies out of the air and play new stupid homosexuals who are fake and retarded. I miss this movie, want on a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil, and a bunch more. where did all the good movies go? I want them back. I miss all the good movies and they no longer have them. if someone finds out if Susie Q or a good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no empty space) 148. thanks and i hope you want this movie back too. Have a good day
