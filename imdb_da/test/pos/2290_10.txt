Ready for 1992, this movie can be nominated or even won. It was so good to capture his era and dual cultures that it belongs to American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what lived here or there was like then, this movie will show you. As an American you will feel like you have tagged together for an extended Japanese holiday, and at the end of the movie you will be a deadly Dragon's fan as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, much as we have done with our culture in our own game. Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a slumping, aging Detroit Tigers' slugger, traded to Dragons, perennial runners up to dynasty Yomuri Giants, Japan's response to the Yankees. The hunters are admired for their success, but the success also has anyone who wants to surpass them, something that is rarely done. Dragons manager recruits Jack as the last piece of the pennant-winning puzzle, and we are back with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more. was excellent: Selleck turned out that with a good script and a character to suit him, he could carry a movie so he made his TV show and the Japanese cast was just as good, down to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard back as image conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the leader's daughter), strong and independent, but at the same time a believer in Japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. She is a real and supportive girlfriend of Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizes with Jack for what he loves her, and a little relieved, at least he knows the man she has chosen to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are huge, greatly enhanced by a prefect Dennis Haysbert as another American ex-patriate and Jack's western mentor. The usual fish-out-of-water items are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling along with Jack to fit in a country that doesn't speak our language and doesn't practice our roads but copy everything we do, including our national pastimes. One of the more fun scenes emerges when Jack, who attaches a magazine, informs his leader that he has learned from the tradition of Japan where you can become full and tell your boss and it cannot be used against you and exercise it properly very humorous. The plotters and sub-plates are tied up at the end, but not too well, and nothing concludes unrealistically. <br /> <br /> To call this a comedy is misunderstood: it is a pure comedy drama or even a drama with good humor. The reason is too deep to dismiss it as it was by critics as an actor from his league trying to wear a lightweight film. The situations were entertaining, but in their place against a much more serious, deep and precise detailed background that results in one of the best movies I've ever seen. Baseball cinematography competes with For Love Of The Game, for realism. Some say that the movie is about baseball or about Japan, but more than anything, it seems to be about the workplace and how people arrive at work from very different origins with different agendas and somehow putting their differences aside for the company or the team's benefit. <br /> <br /> A really big movie that should never have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.
