Wagon Master is a very unique film among John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story drawn by Frank Nugent and the director's son? Patrick Ford and turned into a manuscript, and because of the director's personal opinion about it, the Wagon Master movie John Ford is called the "closest to being what I wanted to achieve" to say it's not say a little, but as Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was still my Darling Clementine and not others. <br /> <br /> The Wagon Master has all the ingredients you can expect to find in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast delivers its best, you have no big stars, except for the "most fortunate" of all actors ?? Ben Johnson. Very peculiar little characters that give a mandatory comic relief, and the Wagon Master has quite a few of them horn blowing sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in her shoots but very inspired footage. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage through it after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr.) are hired to be the Wagon Masters or guides to a caravan of Mormon settlers coming to Silver Valley, a place that is for them as a promised land. Along the way, they are associated with a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women who are allegedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are heading in the same direction, simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest city and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they encounter Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are fleeing from the city marshal, where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Wagon Master is no more or less than a more precious gem in a necklace by John Ford's wonderful western. One should see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
