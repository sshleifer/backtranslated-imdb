Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it's hard to keep an eye on this fetching beauty (giving a brilliant picture-perfect performance) as she simply has heavy tissues. 'One Night at McCool's' is a demented quirky and raunchy black comedy with old-fashioned nuances tied to its well-known but cleverly crafted and chaotic tale that has three men craving for one woman and she milks it to her advantage. When you see Tyler, no wonder why they are horrified and would do something ?? It is something to see 'her' happy and vibrant 'her' dreams. Like Tyler, there is something that is pretty intoxicating about this feature because we look similar to Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is amazing) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the hired assassin with fun, but a dubious hairdresser) Really do well with their roles. The consuming plot opens up with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser), who tell their story of how they came to meet this divine presence, and the final impact she has on them leads to an insane climax. There is an unpredictable chain of events (from fruity to sensual), where everything would almost tie up with a particular ironic (snowball) fate of the characters (who see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl). Howard Black's direction is colored zippy, which balances the manuscript's fast fire gags and frenetic fun if complicated situations. One of the best under-radar comedies in the last decade that wants you under Tyler's thumb.
