So, when I first saw Greek advertising, I had a few questions about how to turn to Greek life if they were to give away sacred fraternity and sorority secrets if they were to focus on brother and sisterhood or brotherhood. Brings or what most college kids think of Greek life as a great party. Fortunately, it covered everything. The story plot was amazing, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be like, a person you don't want to be, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first views on what authors believed that Greek life was like, and I can honestly say they hit the stitch quite dead. I love how one of the biggest things they covered all season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to move away from home and be forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, so come and find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably all college bound freshmens worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Rusty's sister Casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus. Everyone is jealous of. What didn't she have? Oh that's right .. Evan all to himself. Rebecca and Evan had an "affair" early in the season, making you feel quite sympathetic to Casey. Her character developed, and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the most fun loving characters and is completely crazy. One of my favorite episodes was that he was completely ripped off at a strip club, and Rusty had to call Casey to rescue them. I like how they dealt with the issue of gay people in Greek houses, Calvin was a very genuine feeling, and I really respected him because he stood firm in his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she actually liked Rusty. It was surprising, and I continued to question her from the start, but of course I wanted it to work between her and Rusty. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to Greek. It takes you into the truth of Greek life, something many people see past. One of the greatest things known to questions and sorrows is celebrations and drinks. Greek is a good show and the characters are easy to relate to.
