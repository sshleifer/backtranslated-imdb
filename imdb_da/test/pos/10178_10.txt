A SUPERMAN cartoon <br /> <br /> A large shipment of gold is sent by land by train. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a sophisticated band of hooded jackets tries to leave the gold. With the pristine reporter Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, it is Superman's rescue. But now that it's been a race track, can he even stop Billion's DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another in the series of outstanding cartoons Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio. They have great animation and tight, fast seats. Supposed to be shown in cinemas, they are miles ahead of their Saturday morning colleagues.
