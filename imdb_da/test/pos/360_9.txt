I have just watched this thriller, one I had previously thought to be one of Hitch's lesser efforts. How wrong can you be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie gets better with every view, but now I think it's great. Any kind of excitement is out of the smallest detail, and the final scene of joy is just breathing! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
