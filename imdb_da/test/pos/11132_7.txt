A recent study of children in the United Kingdom repeated the performance performed by this film 27 years ago. Being more than anything else, young people will grow up to be famous. It used to be doctors and firefighters who would be children. Now everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of children accepted into the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. We have seen them first audition, so take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has many fine qualities, but in the end you make you feel a little dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits well with history. The film is classified as a musical, but more than anything, it is a drama. Music tracks and dance breaks break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The play is mostly top-drawer with few exceptions. Pacing is a bit gone, especially at the end of the movie, but at that time history has already taken a few wrong turns. <br /> <br /> First, the auditions at the start of the movie should have a few of the basic characters. It seems unlikely that anyone will perform and audition for a department and then stumble through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't see the talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes goes, the film sets in a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is handled very well and it gives you more desire. The movie starts to lose weight later, as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people are just not worth worrying about. <br /> <br /> The movie's biggest mistake makes Ralph Garcy's character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A "professional a-hole" that he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The audience must somehow feel like this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I just hoped they would throw their ass out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you want to worry about as this movie is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this movie. All in all, this movie is good. It is memorable, interesting and full of bold scenes and performances. It may run a little too long, and maybe some of the wrong characters will be fully developed, while others will swear in the background. The musical numbers are great and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered when the movie is over. Although not perfect, Fame will be a movie that lives in some way for many years to come. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
