People talk about how horrible the script was and how terrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are really a Japanese anime aimed at children. Looking at anime today, it's done in the same style, and it's incredibly popular. I don't think this movie should ever be seen by adults. Just as I don't think it should ever be serious. The very things that people think hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. She's smart. She is funny. She cares about the enviorment. She cares for her friends. This movie can teach so much to young children. My little brothers also liked this movie. I must say that this movie taught me a lot when I was a kid. When it came out on DVD, I was first in line to buy it. It's a great kids movie. So what if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely at it.
