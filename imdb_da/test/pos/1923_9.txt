If extreme activities (and I don't mean those Hollywood as UFC & X Games) and the people who pursue them interest you, then search this document out. <br /> <br /> This is one of those truths-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurt's obsession to prove himself against great odds. These odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time that has been lost to us - even though it was 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film authorities have done a great job collecting a wide variety of material to tell their story and the story of big races that consumed him. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but think of Timothy Treadwell and the Apollo astronauts in the 2 big docks GRIZZLY MAN and IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON while they are experiencing - you just don't "see" - this story. <br /> <br /> If you live in a big city, buy it or rent it. It is worth finding. I had to travel 100 miles to L.A. to buy it, and I'm glad I did.
