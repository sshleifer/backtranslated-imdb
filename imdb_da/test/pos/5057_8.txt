This film was a wonderful tribute to the one who has undergone this type of pain and suffering. The act was not the greatest, I admit it, but it was passionate about its message, sending people into prisons without as much as a lawyer or sort of trial is cruel and unusual. They even had a damned lawsuit against Saddam, so why does every suspected terrorist have any kind of fair and just trial or hearing on why they were initially labeled? I get away from the movie, but I think it's worth noting about this sick, winding idea the government has. The film's way of telling the story and the background was a fantastic mystery. The whole movie, I tried to connect the daughter with the plot and it was done very clearly in the end. There is no doubt that the director was incredible, but the only thing I didn't care about was that there wasn't so much emphasis on Reese Witherspoon's character interest and struggle in the ideal she loved to skip. Otherwise, it was actually quite entertaining, and most of all it was my attention and interest for the two hours it played.
