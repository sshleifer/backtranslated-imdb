This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, a lot of jokes are either a parody of another movie (from star wars to draw ball to power rangers to kung fu, etc.) or somehow related to the story of what anyway (Otis creates the elevator), many jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun because it was BC (Like the wheels of the horse carriage spins) Other jokes are just plain non-feelings but also fun (like the famous scene , with the dog running after the Roman guy with the little music) In fact, in these movies they mix pretty much any kind of humor. I saw this movie 6 times already, and every time I see it, I find other subtle jokes. (as the scene where waldo is part of the Egyptian population). It's the funniest movie I've ever seen, finally a ridiculous comedy that doesn't include toilet or sex humor. Numerobis is also what makes the movie, everything that comes from the mouth's mouth is fun. This movie is almost perfect except for a few clich√© things, like the fact that Asterix gets its power back because he's kissed, it's simply stupid. But overall an excellent movie !! 9.5 out of 10
