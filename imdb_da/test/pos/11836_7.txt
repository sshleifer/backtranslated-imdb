This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies - and one of the few to give her the opportunity to demonstrate her skill as a physical comedian who was so endearing in her silent films. OK, so she does a lumpy press number, but even Ruby Keeler's dance from the era doesn't stop for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into incredibly melodrama in the last wheel. It's pretty stadiumy and is of course adapted from a game ... but not good enough. Yet there is some insidious dialogue and slapstick throughout. Worth a visit.
