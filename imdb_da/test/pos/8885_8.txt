When I watched this movie when I was a kid, I did not understand the premise of Hitchcock film and dark comedy. Now, as I am in the mid-20s, it makes much more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason I like this movie is that comedy duo by Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito do some interesting comedy, both slapstick (frying pan and car scenes) and verbal (arguments / conversation over murder and writing). The story is about Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who has his masterpiece chair from him by his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly brilliant Kate Mulgrew, also by Capt. Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). As he switches between the author's block and creative writing school teacher, he meets with students Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring author and overgrown mama's boy, who unfortunately still works as a child. He has toy tracks, should I say more? Think of lack of launch, only Matt McConaughey is short, bold and bald. Owen is stuck in his own life with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey) whom he cannot stand. He seeks Larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he says he should watch a Hitchcock movie, Owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills Larry's wife, he will return and kill his mother for him. Hilarity follows while the two are trying to deal with each other's problem. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to accept his "part of the plan," is driven by Oven's mother. Throughout the movie Larry and Owen slowly but surely create a band of friendship that is rarely in dark comedy today. Part of the movie I really loved was where Owen shows Larry's coin collection and let's just say it a sentimental collection than anything. <br /> <br /> The two main stars aside are the late Anne Ramsey hilarious as Mama, and lethal with that stick of her. She is much more comical and physical in this as opposed to her role as Mama Fratelli from The Goonies. Then she curses as a sailor and attaches her son at every turn, but it does what makes her character so vivid. She makes her character the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another treat in this movie is the music of jazz's great Brandford Marsalis, playing Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. There is a good moment in the movie where he plays jazz to Larry, who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve the pain. Jazz can do it. In the end, I want Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito to make another good movie together, but their kind gets too old for the game. I'm sorry to say. This is one of the rare films where both stars shine in their own subtle ways. DeVito's childish comedy and Crystal's sharp humor made this movie to me. 5 star comedy.
