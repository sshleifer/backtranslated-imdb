I LOVED this movie when I was younger and I actually searched it again !! I would love to see it again !! The information is all correct, but the cover does not look like it would match - I cannot say of course. From what I remember, the movie acted on these children (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) in a driver's class, and it also shows the accident they come in outside the class. Edie McClurg was Alyssa Milan's mother in the movie. I remember really liked it if anyone knows where to get a copy (preferably DVD) of the above mentioned movie (with these stars in it), I would love to know it. Thank you :)
