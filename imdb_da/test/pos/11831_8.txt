This early Warner Brothers talkie "Son of God" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans point to the Chinese. Chinese Americans are treated as second-class citizens, and whites hold them in no other contempt. <br /> <br /> Prolific scenarios Bradley King based his play on Rex Beach's novel, explicitly Chinaman, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences racial prejudices first-hand when the girls, As his college chums bring to a party, revealing their racial feelings about Sam as they learn about his heritage. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren from "Gone With The Wind"), who is a wealthy Chinese with offices, not only in New York but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply hurt by the races and he wants to leave New York and go where he can't be harmed by the Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life, and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam has not yet learned this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and catches a ship to London, England, peeling potatoes while on board. During the tour he meets a British playwright, Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs help writing a game about the Chinese. Sam and he discover a friendship, and Sam gives him cultural information about Asians. While relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett from "To-Faced Woman"), who falls in love with him. It seems that Allana and her rich father are on holiday in the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows if Sam is a Chinese with the exception of Allana. Sensitive to his race, Sam Allana holds in arms until she convinces him that nothing can change him. They fall in love with love together. Allana's father falls on her bomb when he reveals that Sam is a Chinese and everyone remembers living in San Francisco and deals with coolie flooding Allana's mind. She storms into the dining room of the motel and publicly floggs Sam with a riding stove in front of a room full of looking. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sam is terribly destroyed by this turn of events. He thought Allana loved him, but she didn't. At this time, Sam's father Lee Ying falls tragically ill, and Ying's secretary of varieties sends Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn from "Iron Man") Sam a telegram about Ying's disease. Predictably, Sam rides home to New York to be with his father's side. Since his public humiliation, Sam has promised to show no kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies, and Sam takes control of the business, and he practices his anti-white racism until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundation that a San Francisco policeman on beat gave Lee Ying and his wife to bring up. The police forgot about it until two white busy social worker types wanted to take Sam away from Yings. Sam teaches this revelation at the same time that Allana comes to New York and gets sick. During her illness, she spends her name repeatedly in her sleep, and her devoted father goes to see Sam and asks that Sam visit her to help her recover. Unbeknownst to Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but she has nothing to remember about his visit, just a stupid concept. Eventually, Allana learns the truth that Sam is not a Chinese and they marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This socially conscientious Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release honestly and unparalleled with the first-hour race problem or so before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood in his veins, captures both him and the audience a surprise. The Atonement between Allana and Sam stretches credibility, despite their self-proclaimed immortal love for one another. But in a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they close in each other's arms. The capitulation of the race problem with the revelation that Sam is not Chinese harms some of the film's moral power. Amazingly, "God's Son" is a Pre-Code movie that almost seems prudish; for example, Sam is an American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautician and she keeps you alert when she whips Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn Warren convinces as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren made a career of depicting Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is flawless as Sam; He delivers a highly nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of God" is a son of a good movie!
