When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer and a crazy biker along with various other forms of social scum have had enough of their sh ** infected cell, they see a rat and look for the hole. To escape the wastewater, the group of 9 souls, exploit their new freedom and lead to civilization. What follows soon is not surprising. Complete chaos and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has an unfinished business to deal with. <br /> <br /> Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is far in the top 5 best movies I've seen this year. Running right about 2 hours. 9 SOULS will deliver a story so vigorously, it will literally leave you breathing. The beautiful, yet subtle use of rolling country sides adds to the realism expected of this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porn Star) is completely pointless as he implements a sense of shame over the characters. As soon as every character understands their dream, it is as fast as it is torn from them. Now all the responsibility for the success of this movie should not fall solely on the director's shoulders, but props must also go to the actors. This movie was full of excellent plays from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) delivers a star performance and seems to bring some of his mother's honesty to the screen. I must also provide props to the Artsmagic DVD. This is the sixth movie of theirs I've seen now and they seem to be getting better and better every DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and sharp. It is very annoying to try to watch a movie that is too dark in the transmission so that the slices from these cats are fine. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie will soon receive masterpiece status from viewers worldwide. Watch out for 2005 for 9 SOULS; It's really great movie to watch.
