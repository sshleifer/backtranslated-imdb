When I was a kid, I remembered this show, but thought that as an adult, the show might have been a little dated. Well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro (and the musicians are very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is mostly well written. I think it's a travesty that this show was canceled after a season, especially since this show was more popular than the incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should overlook the bad special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman fighting each other, an interesting idea being summed up in the Spiderman 3 movie. I liked the ideas in this TV show, some will hate it. I think Stan Lee was not a fan.
