I had such high hopes that Teletoon Retro could air this, but instead of having performances like this, those who don't get the treatment they deserve, flies things that I might have seen dozens of times before. <br /> The Centurions were the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know it may seem a little clich√©d, but it is true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of the cartoon characters that I really had a crush on. It's too bad that Teletoon Retro doesn't look the same as people in my generation do. Otherwise, Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
