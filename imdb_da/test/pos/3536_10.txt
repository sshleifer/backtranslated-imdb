The Messiah was forcibly viewed from start to finish. The story focused on seemingly random murders of men in London in various cruel ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) must find the truth that, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think. Gripping drama and Ken Stott were brilliant. Hopefully we haven't seen the last of the DCI Red Metcalfe.
