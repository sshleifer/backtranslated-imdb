Captain Corelli Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He becomes a fine achievement as a title character. This is a romance based on a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, beautifully played by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice on love. This movie does not have to be completely predictable. This film also gives Cruz the opportunity to make a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. When the film heats up over the opening sequence, this movie keeps you focused on it. Again Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
