Swift's writing really has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy adventure writers, so it's curious that Gulliver's Travels has been considered a children's novel. Lucky kiddies! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this movie. There have been some really horrible versions of this story, which is why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, it's a TV movie, and it comes from muppets Jim Henson, so how do we expect anything other than cuteness? Look again - beauty emerges in the strangest places. Children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours, but it also takes time to get Swift's dark vision right. I hate special effects, but here they are used to the story rather than just blinking. Please note that manufacturers are having trouble recruiting classical actors such as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole who perform their eccentric roles perfectly. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is made touching and exciting, as well as fun (she is a little girl but twenty times his size). The framework history has a theme of absent fathers that many children will relate to. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with abuse of power (apparently derived from Val Lewton's Bedlam, 1946), another forgotten masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The VHS always comes up in the fridge for a few cents, which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together. I encourage the audience to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to see it. Though it has a lot to offer children, adults will find it fine for such classics as Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious amazing works.
