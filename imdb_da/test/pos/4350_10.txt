Little Dieter The need to fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's cinematic work that is without peer. Having recently resumed it on DVD, nearly a decade after its first US release in 1997, it has not lost its power and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris Academy Award Award The Fog Of War. Like the former, it describes far too short 74 minutes the life of an interesting American. Like the latter, it gives a look at one side of the war that few see. Yes, we see the violence and heroism, but as the war bird brought us into the thought of one of the last songs of the last century, this film gives us a look at the life of a shallow trapped by the enemy, tortured, and finally triumphs. Apart from, in no way, form or form, the film is as simplified or optimistic as my brief description of it. Little Dieter also does not have to fly titler specialist Dieter Dengler and immigrant German who survived the Nazi degradation (we find out that his grandfather in his hometown of Wildburg in the Black Forest was the only man not to vote for Hitler and suffered brutally for that position) after Germany's World War II and his prison in the hands of Vietcong when his air force was shot down over Laos on February 1, 1966. While the film's title and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, was stirred by the impression Allied fighter aircraft made on him, when they beat their city as a child, one gets to believe that Dengler is the film's central issue, it is not true. The subject is Dengler's survival, or more precisely his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are for Hollywood and is an aspect of interest to Herzog. Nor is it the fact that he won a purple heart, honorary medal, D.F.C. and Navy Cross. The thing that pushed Angels to survive so much and remain such a relatively optimistic man (though there are glimpses of darker sides) is what is in the middle of this movie and the whole of Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler's 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully matured Herzog Country, and the use of a Malagasy song, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, including excellent touches in the score, shows Herzog may be alongside only Martin Scorsese , the best manipulator of picture and music in movies. Long must he merge!
