Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. I have seen the original version with Robert Donat, and I much prefer Peter O'Toole's performance and the movie overall, even though it is a musical. I really never saw anything like Mr. O'Toole is that I don't like. He is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for that. It is an all-round heart-warming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I always want to remember (in para) the line where Mr. Chips regrets that he has never given her children and she replies, "Of course you have hundreds of them - all boys." Thanks for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to vote my opinion.
