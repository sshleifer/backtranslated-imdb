I'm not saying anything new when I say "Ray" was magnificent. As I continue to laud this movie, I have to mention something that differentiates it from other movies. Very rarely is a movie made exclusively by the actor (s). "Ray" was simply made by Jamie Foxx. Without Jamie Foxx's wonderful performance, "Ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought Foxx was fun, dates from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show" and I also knew he was talented when he used his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show ") to show their musical talents. But I never thought he could pull out a role like this. I don't know much about shopping and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself in that role and made us see Ray Charles rather than an actor portraying Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was great yes, but it was given life by Jamie Foxx.
