'' Meet Sherri .. for an evening of joy and terror! '' Cheap special effects, cheesy lines, are the original 1978 Movie '' Nurse Sherri '' Starts Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The film is about an evil spirit possessing a nurse in a hospital, then she begins to kill doctors one by one. It worked okay, but some of the actors were robotic. The story was good, but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views. The management was poor and the special effects looked like a drawing, the effects did not fool anyone. The death scene was pretty good, but the director mixed too many things in it that have no meaning like sex scenes, nudity, football player and many more. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
