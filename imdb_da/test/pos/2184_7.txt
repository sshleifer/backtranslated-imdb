This telecast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not do the production justice but is still quite appealing. First, the most comfortable aspect of this version is the production design, from the rolling multi-set to the eye-catching trap door. Then, the recording is excellent, right down to the slash. <br /> <br /> The main shortcomings here are in the notions that people give. Oh, they are trustworthy, okay - but it's pretty frustrating when no one seems to turn their signals on time in a song as fast as, "Kiss Me." In fact, the actor who plays Johanna is not only off-pace in a gloomy degree, but also a bit off-key. And Angela Lansbury's slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit annoying. Another thing - what is it really so bad about Judge Turpins performance of "Johanna" that it is forbidden from the American theater, but not the cannibal song "A little priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is an excellent production. It's a thrill to see people do what they love - and I'm not even talking about "meat pies with a twist".
