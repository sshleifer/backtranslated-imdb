This is actually the first movie I have ever seen in a theater where the people did not leave immediately when the final credits started. Instead, they remained seated for a few minutes and spread with their mouths open and staring endlessly and trying to understand what they just saw. <br /> <br /> All I can say: try to watch this movie with as little knowledge as possible (I did!). I gave it a 10
