Very good movie story of gay, exasperated former teenager, now waiting for tables. The sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically and with an actual human face. This and throw a serial killer on it, and you have love and man remains. A well-portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The play is fluid and credible. The performance is well above average, and the turns of history are sharp. This is certainly not everyone's ideal idea of ​​a movie, but for those who appreciate something else and beautifully written, it is very worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
