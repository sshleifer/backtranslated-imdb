So first thing first .. Angels and Demons is a much better and very different movie than the DaVinci code. <br /> <br /> Following the latest series of comic films, remakes and questionable rebellions of old franchises. It is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining movie that lacks shaky camera shooting techniques, lens flash, exaggerated GCI, and over the top action sequences. In this regard, angels and demons feel almost old-fashioned. there is CERN's large Hadron Collider facility. Hanks's Hanks pretends to be the wise guy and he fits the role much better the second time than his wood performance in Da Vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a special highlight being Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic cardinal. But the film's main saving grace is the pace. for all the time I was completely confused in the story, and the film never gave me time to sit and pick his mistakes in logic. My only serious criticism is that some of the sciences shown are at best discussing the real world's authenticity. But it is not the filmmakers' fault, rather an observation of the old proverb that you must never let the truth get in the way of a good story. <br /> <br /> Talk about which story is a cracker, mix adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a good twist or two along the way. On the whole, I strongly recommend this to fans of one of the national treasure movies (which this clearly imitates, but with a much more serious mood) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.
