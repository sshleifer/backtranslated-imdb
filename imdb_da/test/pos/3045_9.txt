I first saw this movie when I was in 8th grade, and I remember that it had a profound impact on me then. I looked again in a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moves me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle for "principle vs. pragmism". Voight's character is the idealistic teacher who will not give in to any psuedo-racist fates from the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also tells the story of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally come to a booth, Pat Conroy and pragmatism reign lose triumphantly. Or does it? The children whom he has to leave are better to know him, more exposed to the "real" world and the classical music. The other teacher at school got respect for him and he learned a lot about himself. A fantastic movie with a heart-winding end. I recommend that anyone who enjoyed the movie read the book "The Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. It stays with you!
