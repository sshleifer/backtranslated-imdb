It was such a fun movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies like this. The movie is not abandoned as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an uninteresting but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still an unlikely battle for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly friendly girlfriend home. When he helps to feel more at school, showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become friends, but it is completely platonic. When she discovers her boyfriend may suggest, she doesn't feel ready, he seems to like his girlfriend, but she seems to enjoy her free backward college life is not yet ready to live a marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he helps get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend suggests her in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he suggests her, and gives her her diamond ring as it speaks out, was his all the time (he must have come from money or something. Now they never show really close to the ring). The message from the movie did not seem to judge people by their appearance and not to judge people before getting to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, whom her parents love, became meaningful when we found out he was killing his new boyfriend after Rebecca, (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl and thought they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was angry with him, as when you think about it, was a little unfair since they were not a couple, but I think they started to suffer each other. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed that they actually became a couple, they let it be open to the viewers to decide. They never even kissed at any time, even though there was a lot where they almost did it. It was one thing that most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends all the time, even at the end. And she didn't introduce him as his girlfriend; Yet they never told their parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did it. Although he would never be his girlfriend, they could still have been friends. In the 90s, some reason was lymph nodes, and there was this great stereotype that the woman liked passionate (not that something was wrong with it), thought it was due to women as the kind of sensitive type that Crawl showed to be through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I watched the movie, I must admit that if I went to look, I thought I would have gone to the first girlfriend. Still, it was a creative film that tried to teach a friendship lesson and judge others.
