I watched this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was before his time. This is a fantastic movie and a good soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock movies, but even though this is far from spinal loss (which I didn't like)> This movie brings us into the life of an 80's tilt, which will be nothing but. This is no more than our inner child who wants to grow up and be a * ROCK STAR * Yes, I said so. Everyone will grow up and be on the spot light (the weather said or not). This movie just puts you in the heart of emotion and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I have to admit that the play was smaller, but still the music and story were enough to keep you in it until the credits rolled. Worth looking at, especially if you are a fan of you ole mighty hair bands.
