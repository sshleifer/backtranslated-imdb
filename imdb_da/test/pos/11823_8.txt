This is one of the most touching movies I had ever seen. No movie has made me the way it did. This is a great movie and you have to see for yourself. I'm usually impregnable with these sob story movies, but this one did for me. I was in tears at the end. You will long for the friendship depicted in this movie. If I can give this movie a billion stars, I could.
