I usually have a hard time watching a TV movie, the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and I give up and find a good book. However, this made me add up the additions and stay with it to the end. I realize the movie was based on a true story, but it was not brought out why it took so long to find Denny? They had their name and I would assume his social security number. While moving a lot, it seemed that he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job, etc. The actors seemed a little old for the part and a buried metal object when they dug up, had no rust. These were only technical errors and did not remove the file. For a LifeTime Movie, it was better than most.
