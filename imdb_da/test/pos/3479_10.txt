This movie was amazing, it was very fun and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a fantastic movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this movie brilliant. Their performance was excellent, there was this real lively feeling between those who made you believe they were the characters they acted out. Romola Garai is incredibly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their caregiver is well over and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters that the movie continues. It was especially disturbing at the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a real hearted movie, warning to the more sensitive viewer, so make sure you have tissues you will need for them. <br /> <br /> Again fantastic movie !!
