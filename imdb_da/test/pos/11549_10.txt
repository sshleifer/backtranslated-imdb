I have tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this movie, while the vast majority of reviews have given a rating of between 7 and 10. The reason is that this movie is hard to describe in a positive review, even though a few have done it quite nicely already. This movie is confusing, depressing and does not have a good ending. I still gave Pola X a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film. It's really my favorite kind of movie creation. I've only seen two of Carax's films: this and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm a little pretentious when I call this one of Carax's best movies - but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If that kind of movie doesn't appeal to you and is boring, then it would be best not to see this. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Song, so it had a lot of intensity for a thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorbing. The two main roles did an excellent job. (I mean the management and the young woman he thought was his half sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role wasn't that big or important in history. But everyone did a good job. I thought the cult thing was amazing. It may not have been very credible, but it is because it is quite abstract. There is a lot going on between the lines of this movie. This is a very freudian psycho-thriller.
