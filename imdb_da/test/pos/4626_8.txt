2:37 is admirable and shows us what Australian teenagers feel and don't say. These are the stories of real children, and I think we would be naive to think otherwise. The only new thing 2:37 really brings us is an Australian point of view. We often see troubled American children, but often lack the same problems with our own teenagers. Performed with clever and artificial cinematography, however, I (after immediate recognition of the disappointing final song) found the musical direction that was lacking in sophistication. I welcome the amazing film casting of this movie. These are ordinary Aussie children who invite many sympathy for this. Great performances all around and you can't top Gary Sweet, this movie made me remember why sometimes in high school suck and unless you're squeam or you like to leave with heat and fuzzies, go and see 2: 37th
