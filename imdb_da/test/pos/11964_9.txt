When thinking of Soviet cinema, the real propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the foolish meditations of Tarkovsky generally come to mind. They are really good movies, but generally not the most entertaining material out there. The countries of the Iron Curtain apparently seemed to their escapist musicals as much as the states had. In fact, from the 1930s to the 70s, forty of these song-and-dance extravagans were released for much public worship. But they are completely unheard of in the West, so this documentary is trying to correct this situation. It does a fantastic job both in displaying these movies and putting them in the right cultural context. Although I have never been a fan of musicals, I found this documentary to be quite convincing from the beginning to the end. It turns out that no matter how many movies you can see in your lifetime, you only foam the surface of what is out there. <br /> <br /> As for the movie clips themselves, they are very entertaining. While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda, showing workers singing about how much they love to work under the regime, some of the films (especially the later ones) look right from a production point of view. Plus, they are all extremely campy because of how foreign they are to my western eyes. There are a few similarities between them and the American musicals I am used to, but the presence of a strict public enforcement of a message gives them a surreal edge. They do not look like the musicians in the West at all. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining movies I've seen in the latest memory, and it's an absolute must-see for any movie buff. (9/10)
