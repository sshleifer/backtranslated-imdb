I liked this movie. I'm not a big horror movie buff, so I couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre, but I found this movie quite captivating. The story line, albeit a little obvious, had some really scary / tense moments and the actor (especially of the leading female role) was not bad in anyway. I'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has got. I see many movies (work in a video store tends to help), and it's really not as bad as people seem to think. However, I have some criticism. The final call from the policeman was horrible, almost overrated, the dead girl in the bathroom liked that she had a little sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she was drinking) and the children's response to what was instilled in me hope they were eventually killed <br /> <br /> hoping it helps some people
