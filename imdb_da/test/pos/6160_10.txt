Nothing of magnificent photography / filmography in this movie. The fact that you continue to search and hope for more flying sequences tells you that they are just enough. The action is amazing, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are amazing ............. <br /> <br /> A must rent, see or see. <Br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> It's worth having a little aversion therapy <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br />
