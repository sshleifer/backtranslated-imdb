Want a movie that will place you? Well this is a good choice. If you were a youth in the era depicted in this movie - Motown's Fall Day - or if you want to come back and see what your parents were doing so much about, I suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. With the risk of clearing clich√©, you will laugh, you cry, you will remind and remember. You will go back to a time when school violence was a fist. You will remember with love your best friends from school. It's a good movie with an edge of anxiety and pain and realism - misunderstandings, losing friends and deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone regardless of race, age, socio-economic standing can draw something from this movie and really enjoy it. So take a few hours out of a lazy day and check out this movie; There are much worse ways you can spend your time.
