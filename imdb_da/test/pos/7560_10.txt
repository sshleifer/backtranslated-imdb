I was so moved by this movie in 1981, I went back to the theater four times to watch it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No movie evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60s as Four Friends. The fact that it so closely approximates my own experiences in the 60s is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is brilliant and unforgettable! Why didn't she become a big star after this I will never know. The action of the entire casting is flawless, just like Steve Tisch's script. I always wanted to know how much the story was autobiographical. But unfortunately Steve is no longer here to answer that question. I have all worn my VHS copy of this amazing movie! Highly recommended!
