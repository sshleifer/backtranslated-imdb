Ex reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is recruited by a acquaintance (Raymond J. Barry) to find his former wife and son. Asch leads Palm Springs and quickly locates ex Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with a person he believes to be the son (a young Johnny Depp). But it turns out to be a bit more complicated when Asch discovers former white waste Laine is certainly married in the form of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya), and her first son is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> Director / author Matthew Chapman channels BODY HEAT here, and this mid-80s neo-noir is easy enough thanks to an all-star cast and nice places. D'Angelo still looked good this time so she makes a good femme fatal and is not afraid to show any skin. But the mystery is not very convincing in the end. Co-starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his "greatest" career performance co-authored the infamous manuscript of the NIGHT color.
