I caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, but had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next time. Alan Rickman is an excellent "bad guy" but this character beats everyone else. I have never been so touched by a movie! It's been 6 years and I still can't forget "Closet Land."
