VHS - I have seen this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD, I just wanted the movie to have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and disagree with the negative comments and will not let others ruin my enjoyment of the movie at all. Make your own mind and don't let others put you off! I have all Jane Austen's BBC series, but that's my favorite. I see that there will be a new Northanger Abbey released in 2007 that I will buy when it comes out, but it won't stop me seeing Northanger Abbey released in the 80s.
