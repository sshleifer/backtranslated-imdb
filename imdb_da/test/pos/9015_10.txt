I had the privilege of joining a regional premiere for this, this is one of the funniest British movies ever, the plot is great, focusing on a young girl who inadvertently changes to her ideal man at a computer fair and at the same time Creating a copy of himself that falls in love with him, the movie is full of jokes, both visual and audio, and has a clear and fresh sense of it, and the play is of high quality, published in the UK on July 2. This movie is a must see !!!
