'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. Hopefully Jim is really in love with a beautiful woman and appears as a grandfather to her young daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend holiday with the young. Through a strange event, the woman is discovered after they have returned home. <br /> <br /> Rockford's story to his father, Rocky, of the events leading to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer series from a previous era. After much brooding and reflection and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim stumbles on the track that sends him and examines the disappearance with his usual stability. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's boyfriend, Karen, witnessed some mafia activities while staying at the Buena Vista Inn. The criminal bosses responded by killing Karen and replacing another woman in Jim's car. The cheater who apparently slept in the back seat made his departure immediately upon arrival at home. A couple of murder cover follows and Jim continues to their solution while they are suspected of police in LA, even though warrants are issued for his arrest. <br /> <br /> This episode evokes more emotional response than any other Rockford Files episodes combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal to Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not employed to do a job, but he tries to restore his lost love to save his life. Unfortunately, it is not possible, but Jim is trying hard to clarify his feelings, but it is clear that he does not soon come across his evil. <br /> <br /> Despite the appeal of the main story, many important issues have been raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What will be the young daughter of Jim's boyfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see in the hotel that made the mafia kill her? (3) How could Jim run for hours with a cheater in his back seat without noticing this? (4) The daughter said "Mama didn't come back with us". So why didn't the girl scream or cry when she discovered that her mother was absent in the long drive? Regardless of these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the Rockford Files episode that comes closest to being a teardrop. The excitement is convincing and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel Rockford's pain.
