Apart from the fact that this movie was recorded mostly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small shop conference, and I spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and sweet little movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I didn't really want to watch this movie, even though I have a weak spot for romantic comedies (I don't know why). Trailers I saw were not appealing, so did not look so interesting, and I had no idea what the plot would be about. Eventually I found it to be an interesting meditation about relationships and family. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and have to admit that I thought this movie was one of the most overlooked gems last year. I am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very human person that this film presented the viewer with. <br /> <br /> I have read many bad reviews of this movie and must admit a certain level of shock to the cynicism prevailing in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself quite cynical, but it was a beautiful little movie that deserves much better than it did.
