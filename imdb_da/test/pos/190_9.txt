Fabulous film by Sergei Urusevsky helps make this a great job. The opening scenes are as if you are browsing through a master photographer's album, and as history begins to unfold, we are swept away with both the imagined events and the beautiful appearance. Everything is well shot, but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Hard to describe without 'destroying' but enough to say that one is a very intense scene during an air raid, and the lady is left behind, and her lover's brother is at odds with the sirens slipping and the windows being broken. Another overlays a swirling staircase and a tip of wood boards and even develops into a fantasy sequence. Soviet film making of the highest order.
