This cheap remake of the amazing five-star suffers from horrible action. Humphrey bogart stars as head of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to increase sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of moral plays written about a famous murder from 20 years ago. So they hire the false preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the killer who was acquitted and has lived quietly under a false name. The pastor arrives at the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to refrain from exposing her mother and destroying their lives. Bogart is always good. Hayden is good the slimy preacher, and Henry O'Neill is good as a father. Everyone else is just awful. Helen McKeller wins no sympathy (crucial to the role), Linda Perry is a miserable actress, Beverly Roberts is ok but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no share, Carlyle Moore is a dud like the Drenge, Virginia Brissac is miscast as mother-in-law, Robert Middlemas overrides the station's owner. <br /> <br /> This one comes under an hour, but is a pale copy of the original that boasted dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it is always worth seeing.
