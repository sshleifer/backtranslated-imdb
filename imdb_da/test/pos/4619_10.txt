I watched this movie tonight in a preview, and it was great. It does well to portray problems that the average High School student is exposed to. <br /> <br /> I left the movie feeling stunned and sad, yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audience about these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> It's a great Aussie movie. <br /> <br /> See it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from it.
