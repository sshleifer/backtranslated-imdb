I have to admit that I was sleeping in the cinema while I was watching the first Asterix movie ... but this one is simply amazing! It's really fun and it leaves the first mile away. It has many gags and fun situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and I stopped laughing when I reached the car to get home. I repeat: This movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really fun and Cleopatra is a real treasure !!
