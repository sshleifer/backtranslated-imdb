Had fun watching a new independent movie called "Half Empty." I usually go to the local cinema with my husband and feel we are being held captive to the latest Sequel or Prequel, which Hollywood throws with us. This was diverse and surprising ?? So much more entertaining than anything else that Hollywood uses millions of advertisements. When my husband and I go to the movies, are we going to be entertained ?? and "Half Empty" did just that and the film did it in a smart way that made me feel that my trip to the cinema was worth it. It is a fun, human and surprisingly sometimes musical story that cleverly contains in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. The special scene reminded me of a scene in the "Opera's Phantom", as 4 performing artists not only, ie. they sang against each other in a friendly retort. I'm not a movie stomach, but this movie was more enjoyable than any other great studio movie I've seen lately. It's silly, fun, entertaining and fun. Quite comfortable ?? which I expect from movies, but rarely do they deliver as "Half Empty."
