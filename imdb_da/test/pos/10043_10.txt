this is awesome!!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there love is genuine! I'm 24, but this flick is so captivating now that I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so wide, yet so intimate. The last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (the Havilland) almost brought me to tears (Not easy for a 24 year old guy !!), it's so heartbreaking. There is also a deep Christian message implicitly here, the belief Custer has in his honor with you and his wife trust and faithfulness to let him go, to fulfill his moral duty to protect innocent civilians from certain massacres. There are no movies that deal with these issues, like that. a must-see for anyone who wants to see this defining moment in American and military history, from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De Havilland was a screen legend - it only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very best!
