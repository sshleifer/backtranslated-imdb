This is a great movie and if you haven't seen it, go to the video store right now and rent it. First, the cast is amazing. Not only have the current stars, such as Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars in yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has many cameos by actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was also quite good. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comical face as in "Half Baked" it has a true picture of life as "Traffic". So watch this movie, if you are a stoner, it will give you insight into something you love. If you don't do drugs, it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than you would see.
