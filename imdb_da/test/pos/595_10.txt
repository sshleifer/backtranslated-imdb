I've always loved The Muppets. Although most children's entertainment was not so sweet, Muppetens was. The muppet is very, very fun. They are probably the most sympathetic children's characters ever. <br /> <br /> Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They have also played in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas Carol to The Muppet's Treasure Island. The first Muppet movie, The Muppet movie, was also the show and the other films outstanding. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is about how they all started. The kermit seed used to live in a swamp. Until one day, a filmmaker tells him there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit goes to Hollywood. Along the way he runs into lots of people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great and Miss Piggy. Also an evil man is trying to catch Kermit. <br /> <br /> All the Muppet movies are very comfortable. I think they are all very funny. This movie has many movie appearances. Such as Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. The muppet films are all very comfortable. I hear that Jason Segel will soon star in one. I can't wait to see it.
