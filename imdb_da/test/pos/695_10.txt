This film is about reality, submarine warfare in World War II was not a pure precise science. There were no computers that provided accurate hostile details, there was no precise instrumentation for 100% control of the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dial. People with expectations of seeing a "beautiful war" in this movie will be grossly disappointed ... well, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality pushed into their face. <br /> <br /> War is not pure, precise, fought by people who like to break into the song. It is endured by frightened, cold / burnt, hungry, desperate people who are willing to do everything possible to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive at Dawn" is a fine example showing a desperate situation that requires desperate actions.
