This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. Although it's not a regular movie, it is, in my opinion, an extremely effective movie where Eric Roberts is completely underestimated as an actor. (I would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister Julia, who is overstated, but it's another review ...) Roberts plays the pristine ex-reporter with the perfect blend of narrative precision and jaded idealism: two ingredients that is part of an effective film noir. Robert's first person tells the film's quality and keeps us guessing the real motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> Seen in Palm Springs, all about the attitude of the movie is slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is oppressed by its past; The police are oppressed by the rich residents of Palm Springs who treat them as servants; the rich meanwhile are repressed by boredom (see Johnny Depp's classic performance as the insightful rich child who will only be loved ...); The isolation of each character is ubiquitous and is further enhanced by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this movie if they are looking for a more modern version of film noir. While there are elements of the movie that may have been tighter, I recommend getting a copy of this movie and putting it straight between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The movie is based on the Arthur Lyons book, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Robert's play in this, you can get a copy of Ambulance, showing his more beautiful, lighter side.) BEST LINE IN THE MOVIE: "Careful? Careful of what? I should have asked. Only fools ignore the odd warnings of trailer park ladies.
