A bumbling error at the Ministry of Education results in Nutbourne Boys School sharing with St Swithin's School For Girls. This notices the respective main teachers of each school and leads to all sorts of chaotic puzzles, but the two are forced to come to a troubled alliance in the hope of warding off big problems. <br /> <br /> The happiest days of your life are based on the John Dighton game of 1948, with Dighton writing that part of Headmistress Whitchurch specifically to Margaret Rutherford. The replacement of George Howe from the game in the role of Headmaster Pond is Alastair Sim, and here lies in the chronic glory of this cinematic adaptation, Sim & Rutherford are absolutely wonderful and jumping apart to keep what is basically a jokefilm, very entertaining. Directed by the gifted Frank Launder, produced by the equally clever Sidney Gilliat, the most happy days in your life are a distinctive British film, which, of course, is a precursor to the St Trinians franchise, the film entertaining the kids with the high jazz clash between the sexes heart, while tickling they see adults with their very naughty undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic end cements everything that has gone before leaving this viewer with a laugh as wide as Nutbourne Rail Station, fun 8/10.
