The ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naschy in peak form) betrays his pregnant partner / boyfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to get exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko is serious about wounding Bruno before he gets away. Bruno wins in the cozy cabin of the friendly rich doctor Don Simon (a fine performance of Lautaro Murua). He also attracts Simon's two hottie daughters: the burning Monica (delicious Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (nicely set up by the lovely Azucena Hernandez). But Bruno soon realizes that something is very wrong about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. Meanwhile, the bitter Meiko is trying to find Bruno so she can settle for her revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, collides with one of his strangest, most distorted and perverted frightening vehicles ever with this somewhat unusual. The offbeat plot and mysterious atmosphere become more weird and uncomfortable as the story unfolds, which ultimately leads to a truly surprising downbeat ending. This movie benefits from occasional graphic gore moments (beware of the memorable order of a poor guy being consumed alive by vicious meat eats!), Alejandro Ulloa's licking cinematography and a decent nudity and soft sex gush. Good supportive fluctuations of Roxana Dupre as sassy girl Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as amorous playboy Don Serafin, and Julia Saly as the horrible Teresa. A pleasing ugly and worth choker.
