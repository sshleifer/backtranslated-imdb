This is the only Pauly Shore movie you'll ever see. O.K, that's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good choices. I usually find Shore's shtick kind of tired, but he's a lot of fun in this movie. In fact, the script is quite fun, and Shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? Tricks? Anyway, this is a fun if ultimately forgettable movie. --Frink-3
