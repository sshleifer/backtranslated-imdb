"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a great extent through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese visually directs his film. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that can stand for themselves. Thus, he understands movies as a medium that primarily tells his stories of the images on the screen. Especially European film is often very dialogue driven (and many of the young American and American directors are heavily influenced by it). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point that made this movie special to me. It also has a very interesting subject that is wrapped in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is excellent as family manager Salvatore, as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg that I enjoy watching in every movie. There are many beautiful sequences in this movie. Just to choose one: When the ship leaves Italy and the people just stare quietly. This scene is great, especially if you are considering the pop-cultural references that come with it (Titanic!).
