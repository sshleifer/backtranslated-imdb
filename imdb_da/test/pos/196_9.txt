The succession of the Second World War almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill. {Only nine feature films were released in 1951}, and all filmmakers' work was closely monitored and often censored by the government. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, filmmakers gained greater artistic freedom with their images, although many were reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic, and propagandist stance of warfare that had prevailed in previous years. It was not until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and author Viktor Rozov were bold enough to produce what is commonly regarded as the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece, "Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes Flying", one of the finest depictions of war I have seen from any country or period. Not only was the film rewarded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition was soon to follow, and Kalatozov's film was honored with the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The 'cranes fly' is both a refreshing visual feast and a fierce, humanistic depiction of war. Unlike many Soviet warlike films of the time, it was less limited by the traditional war hero's archetypal figure and more concerned about the futile, brutality, and indeed inevitable conflict. Love, as a cinematic concept, is too often idealized as a concept that somehow conquers everything and maintains endless hardships, and yet reality is much less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) were separated by the advent of 2. world war {known as the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945}, commits to marry after the war, but tragedy denies the couple their desire. Driven by the infinite plague and insecurity of waiting, Veronika agrees to ask Boris's cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a beautiful but unworthy youth. The movie can conclude with the Soviet's proud victory and a patriotic flag-waving parade, but the optimism of this order is flooded overwhelmingly by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who walks fun through the celebrating crowds. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of 'The Cranes Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held filmography that captures chaos and confusion of war, realistically and dizzy, not necessarily in screams of shots and screams of dying comrades (In fact, only one of the film's sequences is linked to Boris on the eastern front), but from family and friends left behind. In a particularly impressive, often quoted long shot, the camera follows Veronika, as she frantically seeks Boris in a crowd of departures and their families. The hand camera regularly follows the girl from a bus, goes through the crowd with her - captures instant excerpts from the loved ones who say goodbye to their sons and husbands - before unexpected cranes over the crowd, when Veronika disappears in the dust of a passing squadron of army thought, a breathtaking movement that gives scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first received his film formation as a military cameraman during the war and was obviously in love with the story of hand-held photography: "The camera he once declared" can express what the actor cannot imagine: his inner feelings. The cameraman has to deal with the actors. "
