"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but stands a lot on its own. It's not a continuation of any kind. The final end, which I will not reveal, links the three films together, but not seeing the other two does not make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This movie amazes me because it is so idle, so subtle and simple, but as effective, emotional, and intellectual as a big budget or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski examines the phenomenon of chance and destiny here. Both themes are loosely interwoven in history. The movie is a lot of puzzles, but the message is quite straightforward: Everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destiny as long as we open ourselves to it. The title "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "brotherhood" or brotherhood. The color dominates the film's images. I tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows the freedom to do so;)
