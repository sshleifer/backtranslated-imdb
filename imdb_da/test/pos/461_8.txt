Very literary, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in Hungary in 1956 by invading the Russian Communist regime. Kerr and Robard's playing lovers, she is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fight, trying to make its mark for his country. Other New York theater stars in the period Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronny Howard in his screen debut. Jackson's character is very pregnant and not eager to feed in a soon communist country; She makes a scary plea in the third act of this movie, which takes place in the naturalistic styles we have been told today by Redgrave, Fonda, & Streep. Head of Soviet wolf packs is Yul Brynner, magnificent as commandant and on his sexiest since playing opposite Kerr in "The King and I". He is mediocre and eerie and terribly contradictory to his attraction to the lovely, patrician & heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transitions in the last part of the Golden Age of American Film. Do not miss it.
