A strange beam of light penetrates into dr. Craig Burton's bedroom (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) whom they love. Ca. two hours are uncalculated because they seem to embrace undamaged. During hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse) discovers Craig that his wife was impregnated by foreigners. Sherry resists this view as absurd and is quite happy to pass on news to her husband that she really is pregnant. Ecstatic after trying to get pregnant, Sherry is afraid of Craig's persistence that the fetus is not his. This stems from a control of his low sperm count with odds that are extremely high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife. Unfortunate, disturbing experiences with the fetus in her lead Sherry to some frightening discoveries. Dr. David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) finds that the ultrasound gives some unusual results of developing infant looks, but it is Craig who notes that it looks like an alien! Sparks ignite by cutting out the electrical equipment and extinguishing even Wetherly's pacemaker! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but Lamarche believes her problem is psychologically not physiological. When no one believes in his wife's foreign impregnation theory, Craig turns to sociologist Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif) whose work is in the study of alien life and abduction. But Bert is reluctant to help Craig, who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. Tragic results arise as Lamarche, and others try to keep Craig from his goals of "cutting things out" because he is angry. Craig will still pursue his task of trying to pull Bert down this path with him. <br /> <br /> Grim, absorbing horror story of a man's battle to save his wife from game damage that no one else thinks exists. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a nutmeg, but an intelligent doctor who wants to learn more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens is not hostile. He hopes to learn from Sherry, but it's not incredibly demanding in this goal. The story is told realistically. It is easy to understand why others may consider Craig off-his rocker. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses reluctance in his current situation. How can he save his wife from these enemies and prove to others that he doesn't have to? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table, being probed and molested by these things. Crouse is fine in her limited but important role as the rationale in a situation where her clients seem uncontrolled psychologically. The monster effects are icky and effective. I think the movie seems pretty good and director Yuzna deserves credit to stick to this movie at least. The last 20 minutes that Craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a frightened Bert sees the crazy situation escalating is nail bite. You know fans of "Fire in the Sky" can dig this flick.
