If you know anything about the Manhattan project, you will find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting portrayal of the events surrounding this story. The film is in every way a very realistic depiction of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come out as a real person on the screen. The support molding, like John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson, is also pretty good. However, this movie is not one of the best examples of making a true story into a movie. Big movies are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep the audience engaged throughout the movie. However, this has a tendency to pull a bit through, and some scenes (like John Cusack and Natasha Richardson's love story) could have been eliminated completely without causing the movie to lose much. Nevertheless, there are probably interesting facts and small humorous bits that at least keep the audience interested enough to watch the whole movie. It is not always entertaining, but as far as beautiful pictures are concerned, this is very accurate, fascinating and will leave the audience somewhat to think about. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
