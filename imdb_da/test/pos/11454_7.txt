The 80s are largely seen in the decade when horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were some brains behind it all ("Evil Dead II", "The Night of the Creeps" and "Return of the Living Dead" for example) and then there were the films that were thoughtless but had a definite low rental charm and was perfect for an evening of beer and friends. Films like "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" stacked shelves in the 80s and 90s, offering little intelligence or craftsmanship, but plenty in silly entertainment. Kevin Tenney's 1988 film "Night of the Demons" is part of this tradition-stupid, poorly-acted and not an original leg in his body, but dusty if you don't feel well. <br /> <br /> The reason is so simplified that it should only come from the 80s: A group of stupid teenagers played by a bunch of actors in the middle of the late 20s decides to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen legend Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. decide to throw a s√©ance. It turns out that Will Arnett's "Arrested Development" character Gob would call it, a "big mistake" because a demonic force soon possesses Angela and begins to come to the other too. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead", "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and your average stupid dead teenager, throw them in a blender, and "Night of the Demons" is what you get. The movie is anything but original, and it's really not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derived, the play is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially Stooges character) and the plot holes are numerous. It's out of the way, it's still very fun. So why? For one thing, the make-up and the gore effects are top notch, with some truly memorable moments (especially a creepy and straight plane weird with a lipstick tube) that really stands out. It is rare, if it takes itself too seriously, except for some terrible sayings, it just plays and never wastes the audience's time with flashing self-awareness. In addition, there is a certain energy and enthusiasm for the entire company that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it is nothing special, but it knows, and it couldn't be more proud of that fact. It's a goofy party horror movie, and it never pretends to be any more. It may not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of horror junk food done right. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you will not have a fancy beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
