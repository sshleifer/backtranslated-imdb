This is the movie that finally pushed me over the line for registration with IMDb so I could vote for (and comment on) it. I have recently come to appreciate well-produced "war" films, and this is one of the most meticulous I have seen. "Stunning" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this experience. My husband and I watched this movie for the first time. It moves gently, but still exciting at the same time (not a contradiction). This story in Hollywood's hands could have become another smarmy, action-packed Top Gun Time Waster. The two main players who played Frantisek and Karel played excellently from each other. and Krystof Hadek is a very "beautiful" boy without seemingly exaggerating or exploiting this fact. As for Hadek's working ability and appearance, my husband (tongue-in-cheek) said, "Well, he's no Tom Cruise." I replied, "God God!" If you appreciate beautiful and discreet performance, see this.
