Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the best-known, heart-felt dramas I have just published. It is definitely one of the year's best films from 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio stars Ed Harris, who is worthy of Oscar in this movie, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has taught football all his life and loves the game. But Coach Jones doesn't spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in its best performance, when men of honor come on the football field, while the coach's team practices for the game. Some members of the team then tie radio and throw him into a building. They looked bang on the building, and finally Coach Jones thinks something is wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is afraid, and from that point on, Coach Jones and Radio share a very special bond. Radio is the highlight of all football matches and enjoys real participation in football matches and in school events. He also becomes Coach Jones greatest interest in life over football, which initially was his main priority before both his family and Radio. The film deals with all sorts of real issues, including what your priorities are life, accepting people for whom they are, even if they are different, dead and family relationships. The film touches all these questions and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this movie. What I liked most about Radio was how really it felt. The performances were like seeing something in reality, just before your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny, but other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Radio was much overlooked by critics, only getting average reviews. They must have heads up there butts because it's great how this movie can only get 2 star reviews and something that rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, it makes no sense to me. Also the performances that I mentioned before are first class and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I believe is undervalued as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. Both get some sort of nomination for this movie. Radio is one of my favorite movies this year and gives me reason to still see some of the great Hollywood movies. My last review for Radio is a 9/10.
