"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it is still difficult to see. Not that I couldn't enjoy the movie, it's funny; but it is very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as possible. The story relates to Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the worst women alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention the obese Edie who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts, jealous of Babs. They yearn to persuade her to be the dirty person alive. This means having their caretaker impregnated kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples, flashing people publicly and even sending Babs a turd in the post. Babs fight back to prove she is the most horrible person alive. Which even includes incest, murder and eating canine and other ill sexual acts. It's a movie that's fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) See "Pink Flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. For more perverse, strange sex and body functions, "Sweet Movie" is also seen.
