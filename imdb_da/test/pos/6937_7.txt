"You can't take it realistic." banknotes <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a very different world. I really never saw anything like it. The only thing I would like to compare to is psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√© ?? I mean not only that it is incoherent and absurd, but sometimes it is. I think it takes you through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected feelings as fast as overwhelming you, and when it's over, you'll find it all done while sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that it is extremely low budget, as a disclaimer for those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead" consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. Also note that it is much more "brutal" than you would expect. Children are disemboweled and someone cheats a teenage girl before they shoot her in the groin. Her body is subsequently "raped". It's certainly not a mistake and I actually feel it's for the movie's credit. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie, don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I don't mean to overheat it in terms of brutality. Don't go in to expect "Inside" or something.) I hesitate to give away some of the plot because it's really full of surprises . Even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is immediately a classic horror scene and something completely original. <br /> <br /> Man, I am three paragraphs in and I have hardly said anything at all. Here's why I thought the movie was amazing: 1. It's great and it continues to move. At one point, you expect it to become another NotLD clone, a board-up-the-windows movie, where everyone stays in a farm and argues with each other. At the end of the film, however, the farmer's house scenes will seem like a distant dream. There are also a number of outdoor, urban scenes. These are rare in low-budget zombie films. <br /> <br /> 2. Makeup / gore is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something fun: the early zombies really look lame. So halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prostheses and everything. Some of them resemble Fulci zombies, some reminiscent of Mr. Tongue from "Day of The Dead." And it has big scenes with dozens of zombies mixing around. Never grow old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something weird about it. A sign claims that heaven exists and that our dead / undead main characters are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it is true. Although the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity, they really seem to care about each other, and so I found myself caring about them. <br /> <br /> 4. Pacing is great. It's hardly a dull moment. My only commentary on criticism is that Todd Sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. I feel it personally, it adds to the experience, but I don't think he does it on purpose, so I can't fairly give the film a perfect rating. (Example: When a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers, then he says something as follows: "I'm sorry you yelled at you. You don't know what it's like to have your father standing over you with a straight razor when you're five years old. "wtf?) In the end, it becomes more than I can handle. Involves a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some preachy than credits explain the zombie metaphor. Really, at this point I was stuck again to live my browsing experience. <br /> <br /> Recommended. 10.7.
