I finally watched the third movie in Mehta's trilogy: "Fire". To begin with, I would say that "Water" was the undeniable masterpiece at all levels. The fire comes closest to the soil close to in order of quality. Four: There's so much going on in this movie that I need more views to drink everything. The script is amazing, the manuscript creates friction, starting the whole process of "warming" from the beginning to the end when it really spreads out in a fire, conflicts go into complete breach of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is shaken, fake and oppressive about the great community from which she came from. India is changing fast these days, but much of this is economic change. That she met such a tough resistance to making "Water" after clearing the script shows that there are still many taboo topics that Indian people, more or less, cannot see right in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to keep a mirror on these issues, she faces death threats. As much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, facts are not always that. While "Earth" was merely a historic setting of the civil war after Indian independence, Brand and Water point to personal, social and religious issues, which, as I say, are considered so strongly (negatively) that an open artistic dialogue is still many years away . When I write this "Water" is scheduled to actually appear in India later this year. I believe in it when I see it. <br /> <br /> Four confront a similar sexual and emotional concept that I saw in "A Prize over Rubies". Whether it is arranged marriages (as it used to be among Jews about 150 years ago or as it is among many modern Indians), they have the risk of having a bad fight forced both men and women; or just just lawless marriages ..... But that is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with the very rigid religious attitudes that either hold widows in misery (Water) or otherwise keep women slaves of lawless marriages (fire). I am no expert on either the secular or Hindu laws of divorce. The movie seems to mean that stigmatization (divorce) is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case, Mehta's film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that keeps modern Indian relations distinction. That all three of these films have made themselves feel in India as an unjustified attack on their culture sounds to me as the predictable clamor of an oppressive mindset. Mehta forces the issues to be looked at, no matter how much flat. I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her movies enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo crushing.
