In my report I just sent in, I referred to the young actress as Katerina when it should have been Veronika. I was so involved in the character and the action I suppose I was not worried about names. Anyway, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, films and the director's use of montage are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse '. Production design is top notch. The location of players in the foreground, the middle ground and the background within any given scene is worth studying. Stunning, memorable camera movement, and an end that has an emotional blow that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of going into the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
