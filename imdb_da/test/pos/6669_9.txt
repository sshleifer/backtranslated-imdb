Finally, a movie that handles the likelihood of foreign visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth. Just in case we are not alone, I think these visitors are just for tourists to take care of us or give the talented bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence. We would also not interfere in the races of some excited desert tribe unless we are cheating on our travel insurance, huh? In any case, the film shows the transitional cathexis of a tired mind and body of a superior entity. It's pretty much the spectrum and quite unrecognized, but we are dealing with a movie here, right? So prot hospitalization is just a trigger for the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff bridges work well as normal, but spacious is fun. The role seems to be tailored to him, convincing and lovingly "sour". Eating unpeeled bananas, sitting in a tree, giving his doctor a hard time with speed, wisdom and (most of all!) stunning quotes. They made me think and philosophize for hours. <br /> <br /> It's at least an encouraging movie, and the Edward Shearmur soundtrack is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. catch a ray of light. now.
