"Porgy & Bess" was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see. Even at the age of 5, I was so strongly moved by the drama that I cried loudly on the screen "Crown, NOTE, Don't Take Bess!" I was fortunate enough to see the only TV show of "Porgy & Bess" many years ago, and now all I have is the good memories (and the album of the record) to remember this wonderful wonderful movie. I have been waiting and wishing and hoping that someday I might own a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it does not seem to happen. What is the team up? Apparently, there is sufficient public interest in this movie to justify a release. After all these years I remember it, and it seems like I'm not alone. This film is filled with human emotions - jealousy, desire, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought to light for a new audience to admire and an old crowd to enjoy.
