This is the moral problem in the center of history, based on the real Ramon Sampedro's life. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. He relied on facts that were well-known in his country, as this case became a "celebration" for euthanasia, a theme that no-one in that country wanted to handle in Spain. <br /> <br /> With its backdrop to being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has developed into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. Despite the progress of that society, the idea of ​​taking one's own life is something that is not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens who still considered this issue as something that could not be done in their country. <Br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he joined as a sailor to discover the world. Didn't have the money, it was the only way for him to see other countries, experiencing other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood. Imagine that same kind of sea is the one who takes Ramon's life away as he knew it! For a second, Ramon goes from a living young man to a vegetable! <br /> <br /> Ramon's family is crushed by the experience. Suddenly, they have to leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and sister-in-law are stoic people who actually deal with the situation. Their life becomes something of a reflection, because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to the sick man without protesting or accusing Ramon of the victims they have to do to keep him alive. Therefore, Sampedros is unable to understand Ramon's wish to end it. all. Haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him? This moral problem weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people, because in their thoughts they do what came naturally. The second issue in the film is the legal issue of euthanasia and the well-meaning people who suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him end his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer who is herself disabled and suffering from a rare disease. There is Rosa, the fisherman who is being given Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is total.

This is perhaps Javier Bardem's best role in his career. He surpasses his own award-winning performance like Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet he portrayed in "Before Night Falls". <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles of Belen Rueda, there is an impressive look like Julia, the woman struggling for her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the relative soul who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, as Ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads in his own life. Mabel Rivera does a compassionate Manuela, sister-in-law, who never asks anything about life, but tends to Ramon without questioning why she should do it at all. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar has also composed the joking music score for the movie. He is a man who never ceases to surprise. You wonder what his next project will be, but you want him success in what he might want to do in the future.
