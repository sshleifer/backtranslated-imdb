I watched this movie at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at Palace cinemas, and was completely switched on it in the first five minutes. Thank goodness for a movie that ignores all the nonsense we often see in Australian movies that seem to revolve around a) race b) sex and c) class in favor of you ... dare I say .... jolly good movie theater. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his companion near the city, he spent much of his childhood. Apparently, he has spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film, mainly in Europe. The world that the film creates is both brilliant and artificial, not least because of strange and confusing editing style, the Gothic characters and the surrealistic sense of time and place that draws viewers into its night-life kingdom. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer returned to Q + A subsequent departments. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied "South Australia." Listen, listen! Another asked him what a 'day in Alex's life meant. He replied that he was running an old Ute that he has breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant that he is very well eaten for the last 8 years! and that he plays piano that helps him to think. He does not drink booze and play cricket once a week. Then the Q and A session ended suddenly because of the next movie screening - so my thoughts are that they will extend the after-film sessions to the next festival.
