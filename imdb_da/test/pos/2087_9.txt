This is movie is probably one of the best I've seen so far. I would just say it all to All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same vibes .... "9 Souls" are about 9 prisoners who have just come from prison to find some fake money saved at a time capsule at Fuji Primary School. they later find out that there was not much there and sat down in their own ways. The first half of the movie is only a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be indicated. It is a comical yet serious part of the journey. The other half moved me to tears. As the film progresses, each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams, but unfortunately something bad ends. In the end, only 2 of the 9 escapes are back. The way each person left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. a beautiful movie aimed great. This is a movie for people who have had Toshiaki Toyoda's other movies as "Blue Spring".
