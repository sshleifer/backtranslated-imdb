This is one of my favorite books and I remember seeing this series and love it tremendously. Unfortunately, I have never seen it repeated or been able to get on DVD, but it made such an impact I have never forgotten. The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially the lovely Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely in line with the book, they were certainly there, unlike the movie version with Virginia McKenna who missed that part altogether. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson's character of Strachan is quite different from the book, but he is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the gay pronunciation of "Strachan".
