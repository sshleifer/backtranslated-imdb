As a child I grew up with the chintzy 60s television series (and no I'm not so old ?? POW!). But when director Tim Burton brought his new vision to the silver screen, I simply took an instant glimpse of it and never supported me from favoring his rates over the very latest additions (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) that I don't really care about . Though they go for a much more due approach and want to explore Bruce Wayne / Batman's psyche further ?? but honestly I don't think there is so much to press. I wanted crazy fun with a dark strip, and in my eyes it was Burton brought over and that's why I can see them again and again. <br /> <br /> Having watched the audience with 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gigantic Gothic art scene, and Jack Nicholson takes non-captive performances by the camped-up but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow-up and my favorite of the Batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp but well done. In what would it be fair to be even more expansive, higher, boring and nihilistic and have two scruffy enemies for the price of one. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito beautifully on a limb) and the amazing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills the shirt nicely) will pamper Gotham's party. Through Batman (a suitably vicious Michael Keaton is just as laudable and looks pretty impressive in the bat) look at the eyes) play another fool to the wicked, but I have always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman who gave him an incredibly gloomy mystery but also a wear psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his tour of Bruce Wayne was also well served. Burton's illustrative atmospheric direction opens with his elegant gothic style engraving a carnival cartoon world filtered in with an amazing selection of characters and vibrant costumes. The moody story (in what is probably a bit too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, but rather shows its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set pieces and sharp etched art direction covered with shady tinges and gray / blue neon lights of a wintery background. . The magnetic free-flowing camera work takes flight, and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the toy along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic feature. The rest of the show may be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs into his teeth in a beautifully glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back but has little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are lovely as Alfred. In solid support, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens are also a como look.
