This sequel proves that Tim Burton was the best choice for controlling a Batman movie for all purposes. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the sleek Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the amazing Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best entry in the series has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The molding is simply wonderful, although the obvious exhibition is DeVito as the multilayer penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most important, scary. The infamous scene of Shrecks image consultants is still shaking his back. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to see and everyone turns to first-hand performances. I don't hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all Batman's releases (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a little more to offer flashy effects and large-scale action, please check out this underrated movie. <br /> <br /> If not, it's at least the best movie Tim Burton ever made.
