I was about 14 years old when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie as much as the songs I went to several times at the cinema to watch it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned the songs of the heart, as I did with "The Sound of Music" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-proclaimed critics whose comments are published is that they do not have a romantic soul and did not see the movie through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he is an Ingrid Bergman fan, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so good about her? Perhaps the critic did not appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses as he saw a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and the story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor, and a musical color made it just more entertaining and comfortable without harming the intellectually pleasing aspects. It is a pity that many other films with so-called great actors and actresses with insignificant themes / stories are quite boring in comparison.
