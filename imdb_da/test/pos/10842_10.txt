This is one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness to true love. Being put on the 1800s was a great look at lesbian lives and desires in lesbian women. The cast was out of expectation! Rachael Stirling is an amazing actress, I have never seen her other works, but her depiction of Nan made me connect with her and felt her heartache and pain and love. The only thing I feel most important about is connecting the characters in everything I see. If anyone has doubts about watching this movie ... Think twice! This is a must see series. Well done again to the BBC! We need more lesbian movies that portray true love and hurt like this. Living in Canada, I had this DVD imported, and I'm so excited to have bought it.
