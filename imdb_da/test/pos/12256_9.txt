... there was "Broadcast News" and what a good thing it was. This one stands straight up and sounds his barbaric yawp in a way that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially in terms of cutesy score - when this movie becomes a bit into the eighties, or a bit for "Sleepless in Seattle." Fortunately, they are few and far between. One-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three failed but endearing people in the center, it's smart and moving and almost impossible fun. Holly Hunter in particular can never have been more fun watching in a comic role. (And yes, I include "Raising Arizona", her second star turns from the era, in this review.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
