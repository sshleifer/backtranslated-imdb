This movie is excellent (I saw the French version). There are many subplots (which usually detract from it all), but they are nicely unfolded and consistent with the "discovery of one's real self" main theme. In fact, the whole movie (in addition to his background) is the journey to the discovery of one's (or others) themselves. Is the King really a "good peacenic monarch" trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a disturbed, bloodthirsty hoodlum? Is he a true king? Is the conductor of the Queen Mother just a lusty, career-driven, spineless sock or rather a sharp thinking, bold person? Will the lady / concubine realize who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret everyone knows, but will not tell? What is the true reason why the murderer stopped his "job"? Subplots (something I am not very happy with) are handled well and keep one to the end. Scenes are well designed and CGI fits in well without going overboard. Suspension is maintained properly and actors are up to the task. There is a lot of brain damage smiling, but that was how one had to behave at the king's court (as lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie without superhero moments. This Chinese movie really puts Hollywood cardboard colossals (Gladiator, etc.) to shame.
