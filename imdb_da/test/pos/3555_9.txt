Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all finished now. Dads Army, is my all time favorite sitcom, It's not half hot Mum is also a classic as you are Rang M'Lord. I don't consider Hi De Hi as a classic, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It's about a Butlins holiday, but instead of red coats it's yellow coats. It's run by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff includes fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown into the swimming pool almost every episode), Gladys's fur coat, carelessly girl Peggy, who longed to be a yellow coat and Punch and Judy man Mr. Partridge who hates children. Situations mostly occurred around the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown into each episode (with of course clothes). <br /> <br /> Not a classic but still fun. Jeffery Fairbrother left halfway through, so this, a bit like only bad and horses, stood out for his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat on Butlins. Best Episode: Peggy's Great Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
