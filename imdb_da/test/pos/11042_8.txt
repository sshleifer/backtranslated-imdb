Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Finally, our Odyssey resumes in earnest with Greta Garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent performance from Mrs. Garbo, who appeared from the bat, that her talents could transfer from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix didn't seem to stock them. How strange). One thing I noticed over and over was the way in which the Swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. Anna ends up being the only character I liked; I was really not interested in her foreign father or her would be the suitor. It seems that the sound recording systems are getting better (nobody leans in to talk into the mystery can), but the camera is still not moving. We want to make sure that it changes as our odyssey continues. KEVIN: Our first film from the 1930s is the first sound film of quiet star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations using long stretches of the movie's 89 minutes of play, often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler also in the sound, and it was quite fun as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt, but effortless veil. I have greatly benefited from Garbo's performance as she maintains the movie through even the most demanding moments. I didn't really like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I wasn't sympathetic to any of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally stood up for herself and shows them she doesn't "hear" to either her foreign father or her muscular Irish girlfriend. It is also great to see that the famous silent actress Frances Marion has not missed a step that goes from silent. <br /> <br /> Latest movie set: Speedy (1928).
