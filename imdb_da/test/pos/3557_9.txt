I get really tired of sitcoms; You always feel what comes, so it ceases to be fun. On the other hand, Hi, Hi, you rarely know what's coming and it laughs a lot of fun. I just bought the second set of the series (Series 3 -4) and I'm surprised how much I enjoy it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the authors or actors (or the many invisible crew members) because the entertainment they give is worth the wait. The gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors have achieved through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created some pure gold, some shining through Hi De Hi.
