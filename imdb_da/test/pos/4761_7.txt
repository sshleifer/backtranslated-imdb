**** SPOILERS **** Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral services that could not dig him under them, undertaker Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, came up with a plan to make a lot of money with help from his two crooked friends Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch & Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito gets in touch with his boyhood buddy, Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mob handler to win over Buddy's confidence and get him to tell Vito what's coming down the streets of New York for mob activities. Buddy is a policeman who works in a sub pink union of NYPD, the seven ups that do things "their way" to clean up New York Street for criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito gets information from Buddy and makes it Buddy that he really gives him tips on the mob and whatever it is and uses that information to tip his hoodlum associates, Moon & Bo, to Tear mobsters from their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and keep them for ransom. Everything goes well for Vito & Co. until the mob decides to reciprocate and mistakenly grabs and kidnaps the Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who worked undercover, he was one of the caps that kidnapped and ripped them off. Later, Ansel was accidentally beaten by the Moon when he blew out the cargo compartment of the car that Ansel was locked in believing there was a suitcase full or cash ransom in it. <br /> <br /> Fast paced and thrilling movie with the gritty and grimy photography of New York City so effective in the movie "The French Connection", which also stars Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco in this movie too. Incredible cargo that started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilderness of New Jersey about 15 to 20 miles away with Buddy, who almost ended up in the throat of his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as tough and efficient as any big action actor I can think of as Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who beat the big Sugar Ray Robinson to the mid-term championship back in 1957 and also works like him in the movie: hard-wearing and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good as the Vito undertaker lowlife heel who plays off Buddy and mob to the point leading to Buddy's partner Ansel being killed. Although he is a garbage can, in no way can you help upset Vito as he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offensists to pay his sick wife Rose's hospital and medical bills. Although Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say when you play with fire, you are burned. Ultimately, Vito has a lot to explain to those not so sympathetic and caring. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" features the late Bill Hickman, who makes the dangerous stunts with the car gates and trades in the movie. Hickman was also the stuntman of both major films that made him ride on the roads and highways of New York City and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
