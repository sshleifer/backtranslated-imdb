After a very disappointing part 3 I asked a bit about whether I should break with The Next Karate Kid while I could see why this saga would not continue, I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most of the second and third Karate Kid movie. While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very fun, and the story is a catchy and hot one. Hilary Swank, has this girl come a long way or what? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi kind of "babies" her by. He says she has karate skills. He gives her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there is a boy who likes her and the intermediate bulges that resemble the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
