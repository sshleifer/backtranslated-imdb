Although I am not Greek, I have had a lifelong interest in the Eastern Empire. Its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss for Christianity throughout its history. Yet, while the Easter Empire is not a subject much discussed in US intellectual circles, the United States not only resembled Golden Byzantium's public architecture, the US is being absorbed much in the counterfeit Byzantine historical cycle and has now suffered many of the crises Some people of Middle Eastern involvement involve who it is said there is a slight tendency for excessive exhaustion on religious relationships that humiliated Great Byzantium. I wonder if the loss of ability to speak clearly was the first sign on the way to disaster. <br /> <br /> John Romer needs to be credited not only for his outstanding production but also for his happy enthusiasm for the topic that is most refreshing. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for Americans who like political correction.
