Out of the top 24 lesbian movies in my library, I have to judge this as the number one movie all the time. This movie will go down in history as the best in its genre. It's a story of a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from wealth to rags and from rags to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) popping in and out of her life. Set against a Victorian backdrop in the 1890s, making it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This movie saved no expense for music and costumes, and the makeup Rachael and Keeley wore on stage in the halls only added to the film's diversity. Whatever kind of movies you favor, I can guarantee this movie will not only amaze you but will keep your attention through all three episodes. This movie will be played and enjoyed for decades to come. The urated DVD collector's version is a must for everyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice for casting in these two roles and they played extremely well.
