The story line for this game is very jerky, where it seems that the game's authors have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in the Tales of the Soul. That said, this is the only grip I have about the game. The Beginning FMV is spectacular with beautiful scenes and interesting new entities such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own Martial Arts discipline. There is even another story mode that constitutes the eerie Story design of Soul's speech. <br /> <br /> Parts of the FMVs under the Tale of the Souls are also interactive where you can determine the fate of your carat to some extent, which is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many combinations of characters you can create, the varied paths you can explore in the stories of souls and the story of the chronicles of swords, this game will keep any Beatem up / RPG fans amused in one piece time!
