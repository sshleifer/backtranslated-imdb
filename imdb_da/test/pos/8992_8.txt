I am a great movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This movie is packed with great actors, well-developed characters and in plays that make you dodge and dodge in your seat, but with more arm tackles than pee football and almost every shot cuts off as soon as a player touches the ground filmed for almost as football. If you want to bring your kids to watch a movie that will build character from within and be able to inspire a blind man to see again, I can easily give it 9 out of 10 if you want to see a big rugby movie that really shows the sport you will have to wait for the next because Forever Strong is mostly practice, running and a ruck movie, for that I give it a 7.75 out of 10.
