Definitely a movie for people who ask to be entertained and who do not override their movie. <br /> <br /> Lots of action, lots of good dialogue (eg, fun to quote), a little intrigue and things jump up everywhere. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the woman part was the competent act is a pleasant deal. <br /> <br /> Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite movies, turning every 3 or 4 months. I first rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie, but was caught up in the events around Samantha's attempt to regain her memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All your cerebral people out there - suspend the infidel once, take yourself a little less seriously - you can actually enjoy yourself!
