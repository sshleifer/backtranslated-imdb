Dogtown and Z-Boys are a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and their influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the skateboarding's history. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentaries are members of the Zephyr team and are told by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the start of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. It discusses skateboarding popularity in the late 60s and 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname on the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr team comes from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original Zephyr Team members who talk about the past in the Zephyr team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three special members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team. <br /> <br /> The interviews in the documentary were usually voiced by Dogtown archive films in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely do you actually see people being interviewed, but when you do, they appear in black and white while the archive films were in color. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (ie the glory days of the Zephyr group) and not the present. The documentary is very fast, as we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over the early music of the era (like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews tend to be quick and to the point. Knowing nothing about skateboarding (that is, not even driving one on the ground). I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so even though I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team. Because it was made by the actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity. All in all, I would say that this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr team, but for skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
