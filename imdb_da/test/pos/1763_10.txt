Could this be one of the earliest color films? It is actually the other. This is a very beautiful piece of film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful of all Thomas Edison movies. It shows a girl dancing and moving her dress around, which turns red with the movie. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You see the story when you see this. You see what started making movies of the day great! This may not have a plot or something very interesting, but it is the second color film ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you teach students about movies or some of the things you need to show them what started color film!
