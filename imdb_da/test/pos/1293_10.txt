I saw this episode of the Masterpiece Theater and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user who thought it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10 and underwhelming. I would feel moral if I did not disagree. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm an avid fan of the Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories can be a bit stupid on television, for example, "He knew he was right" was absolutely horrible. However, "Carrie's War" is probably the best I have seen so far. The whole cast does an excellent job and it kept my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. The grade Mr. Evans are of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, a pristine birthday cake or a pomegranate, my opinion of him went from bad to really good. Indeed. His ultimate death, and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man, is what brought the bitter sweetness of this story to me. The end is pleasing in every sense, but one; that everyone didn't get what they deserved, but overall things worked. I definitely recommend this to anyone.
