Yes, it's a bit cheesy. But it is exciting and entertaining, and one of my favorites; There are some excellent actors in the movie and they do a commendable job considering the boundaries of plot and character. It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy's role; I thought he was quite trustworthy - and rather chilling - as the increasingly paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a favorite for a long time - I think he brings his character to life very well; and sam waterston has been star quality in all of his i've seen - movies or tv. <br /> <br /> I see this movie so often, but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality, it's hard to enjoy it altogether. This is a movie I think they should put on DVD; Maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are many people like me out there who like this kind of movie, so there would be a DVD version market. I want to keep the hope!
