I don't know why critics are bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark - yes, weird - no. I am sad and with many feelings, especially with the Penguin's history. They say it has elements of S&M, but I really don't find any of that kind except Catwoman's whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and villains are not just crazy freaks dressed like a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong emotions involved. Catwoman (a great show by Michelle Pfeifer!) Is not just a sexy chick who likes to steal jewels - she's on her personal crusade and penguin ... well, at the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him Danny DeVito). Again I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he wears his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can see that it is a Tim Burton movie because it has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.
