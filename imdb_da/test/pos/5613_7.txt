I thoroughly enjoyed this movie ... and I still see it from time to time. I have used it in my music classes at the school where I teach. The kids seem to enjoy it even though they want it to be in color. The best thing about this movie is for me, who grew up after Heifetz's death, is the chance to actually see the master violinist working his craft! I was surprised how the story is "updated". Although references to "reform school" are outdated. A boy whose father was dead and raised by his mother and grandfather .... most of our children today are raised by steppesents, although the film makes it seem like most stepperents are cruel. I get very angry when his mother does not take his side and defends his actions against the ladder. <br /> <br /> The musical choices are also hard to believe. I find it unbelievable that a child who appears to be approx. 8, can play "Minute Waltz" or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's a real fun, feel good movie, and I recommend it. I wish it would come out on DVD.
