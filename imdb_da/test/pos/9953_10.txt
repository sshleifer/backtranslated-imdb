Hey. hi and goodbye but before i go, i wanna talk to you. I just want to quickly mention a few key points about this movie. the first is eroticism. especially homo-erotics. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. let's get started. When a man and a man love each other a lot, they merge into a spectacular, not to mention sore, explosion of cinema, which we call the merchant of Venetians. <br /> <br /> The gay erotic love was sensibly worse. and even more sensual at best. it was hardcore and emotional. It touched me inappropriately, and I'm pretty sure I touched it back. And when no one looked, I also touched a little. <br /> <br /> I laugh because portia was denied. she was second in line with our friend, the gay erotic love. Oh tonight. antoni. just toni. I love you. more than you loved that guy. whose name may or may not have contained a "B". he was well ugly. <br /> <br /> Antoni was very greasy. he scraped his body in an enclosure of his own hair fat and sensual juicer and continued to write on the screen and present himself to the guy with the name I like the movie in conclusion, go watch the movie, if not for gay erotic connotations, for love for a man like antoni. just toni.
