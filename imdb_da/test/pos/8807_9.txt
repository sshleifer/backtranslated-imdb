As I sit here, I find myself laughing at certain moments in this movie. Go see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've ever been to the club, go see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you ever want to go to clubbing, go see this movie. My bet is that the film was worn from an idea while it was outdoor clubs, and this is the product of the one-in-a-million chance someone remembered it in the morning and had the application follow it through. <br /> <br /> In summary, go see this movie. <br /> <br />
