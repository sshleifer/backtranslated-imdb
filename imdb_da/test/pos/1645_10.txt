A team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and the guy who plays Bana at Seinfeld goes up to an Arctic research institute where all members have died of either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover that there is a worm - a virus - that is parasitic to madness and death. The problem is that when a particular dog turns out, anyone can be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode in season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show. The Arctic environment encloses the characters, and of course as the carpenter is Thing, it is very fun to see these similar characters suddenly begin to turn into dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, I have nothing against them at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than it would normally because of the excitement, and because all actors (including the Bana guy) understand what is happening in history. And as always, I loved the ambiguity of the end. Highly recommended.
