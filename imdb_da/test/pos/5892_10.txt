Best year in our life is a movie that slides under my radar for years - I had heard about it but never had the opportunity to see it. Thanks to TCM On Demand I could see it unknown and commercially free. What surprised me about this movie was how quickly it was made after the war. The film is honestly about the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It nicely manages to include almost all forms of war experience within three characters. <br /> <br /> We have Air Force Officer, who was the veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the horrendous impact of the crews from the bombers, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for turning off officers who quickly rose through the line. That was the case with this guy who went from a low soda drink in civilian life to a captain and bombarder of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called "fight fatigue" at that time. <br /> <br /> We have the Army non-com that served in the Pacific and suffered horror from this campaign. His story is opposite to that of the air force commander, going from a prestigious job as a banker to a small shallow in the army and rising to the rank of the secretary. From the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant, but he is still on the front line. Finally, we have Navy Seaman, who is part of faceless support staff, commonly referred to as REMF's (Rear Echelon MFers) by the fellows on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when he works as a mechanic under deck on a naval ship, his ship is hit, presumably by kamikaze, and is immersed with the loss of 400 lives. He is pulled from the water, but his hard-burned hands are amputated and replaced with prostheses. <br /> <br /> BYOOL tells the story of how these three meetings are on a transport plan they have at home, and how they align with civil society. What impressed me most about this movie is that, despite the obvious problems facing the three main characters, it never comes down to the melodrama. The Navy kiden, played by an actual amputant, is placed in situations where we may be sad, but the script never lets us feel that feeling. The army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points it out, but never lies on it. The Air Force captain struggles with loss of status when he is forced to return to the pharmacy where he has soda moved (now bought by a large chain) and takes a degrading job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife. <br /> <br /> The script provides many opportunities for all of these signs to come to some dramatic climaxes about their suffering, but it immediately avoids it. But for the overly dramatic score, the instructor has started to exploit the obvious. <br /> <br /> In a scene that represents the whole movie, the army sergeant (Frederic March) discusses a discussion with her father and mother about air force captain. In spite of their marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up in marriage, which, of course, is uneasy. Now we have seen thousands of scenes that are typical of this, where the father blustered angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, mother, console daughter and motherly wisdom meet and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene is quite different from the cliché I have described above. Sure the conversation is warming but all parties are reasonable and there is a serious and timeless discussion on the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialogues I've seen. In the end, BYOOL is highly satisfactory film, with honest performances from the whole role. Technically, it is well shot, the editing and movie frame, but never overshadow the poignant tale. Despite the score, which is cliché and overdramatic, I give this movie the highest rating it clearly deserves
