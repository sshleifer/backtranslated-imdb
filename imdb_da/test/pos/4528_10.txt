How many reviews of this movie should I write before I get it right? Tom Conway fully inherits the Falcon's mantle from his real brother George Sanders with this post. Decked out in beautiful double-breasted, single-button, drapery-style suits and cruising in beautiful, 110% star cars with big fender skirts and suicide doors coming up to your armpit, Conway travels from New York to Miami to Keeping a formula for industrial diamonds falls into the wrong hands. His "client" is lovely, virgin Louisa Briganza, who has beautiful hair, but lets you kiss her only for the first two months. Along the way he runs into the kind of colorful array of characters, only one B movie can provide. His sidekick in this excursion is perhaps best among Falcon sidekicks Edward Brophy as Goldie Locke, who gets some really fun lines. He runs into the creepy bowl of Doris Blanding, the type of '40's chicken that you know puts out. Her cohorts are Benny, played by Steve Brodie, who twenty years later was a Presley bag in two Paramount King films. They both work for cold fish and yachting-cap-wearing Kenneth Sutton, ready to do whatever it takes to get the formula when he crosses his yacht to Brazil. Saddled with the stoniest Falcon-pursuing police ever, this post still ranks high. Forget about the 120 minute melodrama, give me a 1 hour Falcon movie every day. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shoot some dry martinis and forget about your problems with this amazing Falcon movie. But if you didn't lose it from local TV in Toronto as I did 17 years ago, you have no luck.
