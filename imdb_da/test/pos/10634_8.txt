In the first twenty minutes we are eliminated by several highly portrayed emotions: A stifling and indulgent mother has a violent argument with her live-in-40-year-old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music) love for her students expressed in illegal critical assessment; the joy that music can inspire in both the listener and the performing artist. Within this short time, our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very true signs. We are also swept away with heavily performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with great attention to shade. Such a material alone would have been the basis of an excellent film of widespread appeal. But the trend in the French cinema is what it is, it goes deeper, examines the teacher's repressed sexuality, expression of sexual freedom, and subsequent collapse within the framework of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are attracted to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering can be related to the genius's performance, especially in the composers she admires. The piano teacher includes graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people may not want to see. The scenes are crucial for the dilemmas that the film seeks to raise, and it can hardly be called free. It can be a great movie, but it is not common to see it.
