I read most of the comments here, where everyone saw only the film's shortcomings. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but it has something everyone could relate to. I don't want to pamper but tell more than the plot - finishing school and the trip to a big party, or if you like to look beyond the metaphor, you choose the way through life. Remember youth days? the days when you or our friend acted like the signs? Or do you think you should act as one of them, and now you regret not doing it? If you can go back to that time and if you can ask yourself one of those questions, maybe the movie wasn't that bad.
