Although many sound recordings of amazing musicians such as Jascha Heifetz survive, the movie or television record is actually limited. That is why musical offerings like "They must have music" are such rare gems. While modern eyes and ears can suffocate the plot, the perceived viewer should put the film's unique delights in their proper perspective. The plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences in the era, but it is still fun today. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic movies is seeing them through the eyes of the film group in that era. <br /> <br /> I have to address the issue of reviewer complaining about a monochrome movie or who is obliged to report that their students are expressing such reservations.

Color can actually get in the way of a good story or the music. For example, the black and white photograph of John Ford's "Stagecoach", like the stills of Ansel Adams, is an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As for the Heifetz as a tree, I couldn't disagree more.

This is from the 1947 movie "Carnegie Hall", "not" they must have music "" Carnegie Hall "is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime. We are blessed to have movie producers who at least In these limited cases, they chose to showcase these artists, you were still an era that was not completely overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator we get today.
