A very intelligent and exciting thriller who doesn't rely on action, but on a situation that is far too rare these days. I would compare this movie with The Jackal Day, another movie about the exercise of a dangerous international criminal. The action across the table is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a difficult dual role as the evil terrorist Carlos and as the marine man unfolding him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who helps in the plan. This is a very exciting and effective movie, and it is remarkable considering how little action there is in it. The first half of the film is entirely created, as the Marine man prepares to imitate Carlos. The other half is a breathless act, the action that comes out of the characters and their situations, making it even more gripping. A really tight movie that should not be overlooked.
