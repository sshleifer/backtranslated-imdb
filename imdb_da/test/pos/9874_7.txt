For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate when I really don't think they're so bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this movie, I think it's too overcritical, I'm really not that bad for a movie at all. In fact, I think this is one of the better followers. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally kills Jamie Lloyd (who was captured by "Man In Black" in Part 5) after she gave birth to her baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family, who now randomly live in the old Myers house (which seems to change in every movie). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters along with Tommy Doyle, the now grown boy who survived the original killings. They have to fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult taking care of Michael while Michael himself is driven to kill by an ancient Celtic ritual where he is to sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can't understand all the hatred it has got. It had some good tensions, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I admit), some scary moments here and there, and lots of gore and knife slopes to appease all of you gorehounds. Not all the plays were not very big, but it was compelling enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady, and she is very sympathetic. Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Doyle and is also very talented and plays his role nicely. The rest of the support molding (besides the glorious Donald Pleasance) is not much to praise, but neither was it too bad, all taken into consideration. I'm still not sure if an explanation is given as to why Michael kills was absolutely necessary, but it turned out to be okay in the end, and I wasn't worried about the way they tie everything together. The open conclusion was also a bit boring, but could have been something more. <br /> <br /> I've also seen the infamous "Producer Cut" of this movie, the original cut of it, and I think it is better in some respects. It further explains the Thorn Curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the movie, plus the end was much better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion that we get in the study of movies. I want Dimension to release this alternative version of the movie because I personally think it's better. However, the chances of it being very slim. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will delight all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror movies, but it is definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael do his thing. Just don't expect shine and you will enjoy it. 10.7.
