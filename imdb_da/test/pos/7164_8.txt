I originally saw this movie as a Blockbuster VHS rental. It was some time ago, but still remembered it. Blockbuster no longer has it. Netflix didn't, and there weren't many copies online - just a few spendy VHS copies. Recently, it finally found in DVD format on eBay at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL discs on our NTSC TV). The woman and I both enjoyed it. The movie's style is a little strong, and many, if not, most of the parts are pretty much overplayed as if amateurs did it (especially the kids), but it's not annoying. The contrasts in the societies are highlighted in overlapping. There is a bit of political sermon to say that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not so great life, but instead should at least try to do things better first. But it is not dominant. It's pretty humorous mostly. <br /> <br /> Some downplaying of west commented by others is not that at all IMO, I take it as a comment on expectations of the Russian characters. At least when taken from my western point of view. Perhaps it is a blow to the west from a Russian point of view (as it is literally the characters that say it). <br /> <br /> I can't say how literally the movie is, the English subtitles are, but I can say that the subtitles were performed very well, full of English idioms as if they were made by an English family speaker - Complete with "colorful" languages.
