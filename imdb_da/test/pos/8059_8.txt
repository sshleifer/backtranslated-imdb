After the Second World War, the pre-crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by the money of an army base just across the river in Georgia, was even worse. Games, prostitution, mortgage lending and the like contributed to an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to tolerate even more. This movie is based on the real story of that battle. <br /> <br /> The standards of the 1950s were shockingly explicit. Although the low budget, the same small budget helped with the realism that requires space shooting. A very gritty movie. Richard Kiley was wonderful as always, and John McIntire stole. <br /> <br /> Why this great movie is not on video is a real puzzle!
