I love this movie despite the fact that it just misses being fantastic. It is an adult entertainment full of problems that an adult can relate to. The action is amazing. It's fun to see John Cassavete's and Gena Rowlands as a fervent middle-aged couple. Who knows how much of it comes from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than her freewheeling character, Aretha. Raul Julia is a hoot like a lusty goatherd. The landscape of Greece is spectacular; The New York settings make me move because of many shots from the World Trade Center. Great score by Stomu Yamashta. With so many things going for it, why isn't it a good movie here? It is a little wandering and too long, unfocused and uncomfortably unbalanced between humor and drama. Yet it is engaging, entertaining and deeply thought-provoking.
