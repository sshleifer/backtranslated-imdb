I put in the DVD that expects camp perversion from the creators of Society and Re-Animator and was quite surprised to get involved in an authentic thrilling story. Action was top-notch (nice to see Vosloo in a leading role after a variety of villains), the story involves, and the few winding are quite surprising. I figured I would accelerate through much of it to get to the abduction scenes, but instead saw it through and was only let down at the end. Maybe I'm too shabby, but as I said before, I didn't expect much more than foreign sex. Of course, if you are looking for some hot foreign sex, you will be disappointed. It was mostly quick-cut exam staff in rubbish with a blink-and-you-miss-the glimpse of an interesting 'impregnator' alien.
