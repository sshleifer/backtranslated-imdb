(*** Less spoilers ***) If there is anything in the world of quiet clowns that puzzles me, Charley Chase never got his well-deserved "breakthrough" in the movies. Oh well, maybe it's no wonder, really, as far as he never starred in any full length features. But when I think about it, such an explanation just makes everything all the more mysterious - why does Chase have no offer to play the leading lead in features? One explanation is that his character, no matter how entertaining, was simply too realistic to fit a longer story; Without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians had, it can be assumed that the comedy he did and which worked so well for twenty minutes would be repeated after a few wheels. I do not buy it entirely, since Chase's gag construction is magnificent and could, I think, at best maintain the viewers' interests alone for a longer time. At least I am tempted to think so when MIGHT as a bog runs the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moose is not extraordinarily beautiful, and Mrs. Moose is hardly a "classic beauty" he possesses the really greatest teeth of any human on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. Both take plastic surgery without each other's knowledge, and when they encounter accidentally a little later, he does not recognize his wife and she does not recognize her husband. A number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. I don't think I'll reveal anything more to make the view more comfortable for you. Because if you are a fan of silent comedies, or even if you are not, PLEASE LIKE A MEETING so many memorable moments in such a short time that I would look at it as a shame not to see it; stupid indeed, but no less extremely fun.
