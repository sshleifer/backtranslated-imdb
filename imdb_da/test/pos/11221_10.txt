After a little further thought about this movie, I find it all too easy to dismiss it as the boy's dream. I actually received some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... Angels exist .... we are absolutely entertained by angels .... most of the time we are not even aware of it ..... On A point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, I personally really needed this movie. Yes, as I wrote before, it speaks to so many ...... can't wait to get to heaven ... "Being so sick of all FX and Formula stuff, I found this movie to be real movie theater "All I can say is that touched me in so many ways that I still sort everything out. North Fork is a wonderful movie. One that brings the mind of the viewer out of the gutter and into the heart. The spiritual aspect is so exciting." Please pay attention as you will have to use the brain and heart that God gave you to follow the story, I think it may be a little over the head, but I feel it is the people it is talking to Most importantly, I want to see it several times, just so I can do it all! <br /> <br /> The industry must study this movie to realize that we exist. <br /> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved in making this movie.
