Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are delighted to see this scrub comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was an up and coming star when the film was made, is a hoot. Dean Stockwell, in a mission by John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as the paranoid and over the top Connie steals the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, formerly known for crazy comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard", reaffirms that he is a genius. I was not surprised at all as he continued to win the Oscar for "Silens of the Lambs". The performances he evokes from his "Married" actors are inspired, and the audience is gathered for a wild and wicked ride. <br /> <br /> One of the sweetest, most imaginative films of the 80s is the head and shoulders above many of the satires in their era.
