I was like seeing it right, and I was like oh, it's so amazing, and then I was all as ya pretty good, so I really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the British people, and I think that the doctor is a very good doctor in his way to do such wonderful doctor-y things and he was a very strange man and i was like maybe i dont like this guy because he is a new doctor and i like the old doctor who is not this guy but so i looked at him and i was like oh this is great and i liked it so i saw and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great conquest of the evil guys and the happy doctor that is quite scary and happy
