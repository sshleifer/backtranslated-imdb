Watching Stranger Than Fiction Director Marc Forster's The Kite Runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this epic character of the artificial PG-13 is good for your movie killing diet. No, it's not the kind of movie I like to relax on the couch and eye at the end of a hard day. Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your problems. First, no celebrity stars appear in it. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so unusual that you do not believe in a picture that you see. Third, Kite Runner falls into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native language. Fourth, Forster's movies are not a romantic trifle about the boy's wish-girl, the boy-loser-girl and then the boy-winning girl back. Fifthly, this foreign language film can make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship and survival. The main themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a wrong offense in the first half of the act he is supposed to commit at the expense of his own personal security and integrity. Kite Runner is about redeeming the sins of the past. We're talking about personal responsibility, so let's not rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's evening party or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama looks right and down initially as one of the glowing youth films in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. In half an hour in its 127 minutes, this escapade of two young people flying kites in Afghanistan becomes dark and unlucky. Nevertheless, if you can cope with the remaining hour of the plot, you will come across satisfactorily, relieved and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> In the year 2000, Kite Runner opens in San Francisco as our protagonist, Afghan emigrant Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receiving two boxes of copies of Amirs first novel. In the past, Amir has had a chance to bask in his life story as a storyteller than the phone jugs he from his reverie and he reluctantly retracts into a past that is best left for him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant of Amir's household back in the 1970s when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun father-in-law Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have a chance to be good," said Rahim Amir, without sugar coating his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enters the war-torn Afghanistan and rescues Rahim's young grandson Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is imprisoned against his will as a sex slave to Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) a gruesome Taliban chief and Amir's once feared opponent. <br /> <br /> In 2000, Kite Runner changed from San Francisco to an expanded flashback set in Kabul, when life was idyllic. The twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and his father's servant, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), love watching movies, such as John Sturges' Western The Magnificent Seven, when they are not flying kites. Incidentally, this is a flight that you have never seen kite flying. Not only do the kids fly with them, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the string of another child's dragon. The kite battle situation creates the same kind of excitement that the dog's fighting scenes had in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the degraded Hazara minority. Previously, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two flunkies. Assef was beating them up, but Hassan pulled his slingshot and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to back down. However, Amir was willing to suffer the fate of the hand had treated him. Amir's father Baba paralyzes his son's lack of spine and fears he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward, unlike the nice little Hassan who bends Amir out of prediction. Anyway, Amir and Hassan show up from the showdown with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir sets a new record with his escape flights and fighting skills, Hassan runs for a dragon to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. Hassan claims the fallen dragon, but he finds himself merciful by Assef and his two minions. Assef lets Hassan hold the bearer, but his minions pin Hassan scattered-eagle, belly down a hill, while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worst, a traumatized Amir looks at the attack from nearby, but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the extraordinary airscapes with the dragons, The Kite Runner is down-to-earth, straight forward. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he masks like a Taliban fighter, but he doesn't carry firearms. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is rather the escape scene from The Midnight Express. Although Forster does not explore local politics or jump into the ethnic and cultural problems at stake here. Indeed, Troy's scenicist David Benioff had removed some parts of the book, and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly defined, so one has to accept some things on the faith. Forster lent the film in almost China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making this two hours plus epic fascinating. The performances, especially of the children, stand out for their credibility. Kite Runner is a movie that you cannot easily forget.
