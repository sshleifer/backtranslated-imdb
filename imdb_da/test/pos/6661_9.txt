In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) for health reasons. Ada also encounters it shyly Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. In the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support for being alive is the desire to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a survivor of the war, helping her in the yard and becoming her best friend. History changes current and past situations and reveals a beautiful romance. I liked this movie a lot. Having names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the support cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications of Oscar, do not disappoint this film. My note is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of those showing what is happening to Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her yard, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
