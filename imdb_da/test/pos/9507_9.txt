They were alternative before there was an alternative, The Residents is a band like no other and I love them for it. This has all their classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll' to their tribute to the great James Brown with an assortment "This is a Man's Man's Man's World". But that's just the beginning. As a bonus, it even has Renaldo & the Loaf's hauntingly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging Larvae' and even features The Residents' cover of it. Needless to say, I highly recommend purchasing this DVD, I also recommend buying their latest album 'Demons Dance Alone', it's great. Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
