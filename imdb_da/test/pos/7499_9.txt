The best screen performance ever by George C. Scott. The manuscript of Chayefsky, the irony-shipped dialogue, is almost perfect ('Where do you train your nurses Dachau?'). Rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who rescues Scott from judgment, as it is all thrown. It's a fun and serious movie. It's a movie from the 60's, but it's not in any way dated. What it is about, the system's chaos and irrational character vs. the individual's health is timeless. And "We cure nothing, we cure nothing" monologue (delivered, actually cried like no other, but Scott could) with his references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science could literally be written this morning. <Br /> <br />
