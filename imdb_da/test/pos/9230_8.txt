Bullets can't have jumped out of the chest, but The Lone Ranger was neither the symbolic icon for me as my other boyhood hero - Superman. He represented the truth, justice and the American way in a classical Western Western setting that lived out of the principle that he would never use his gun to kill while he scooped the American southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring every crime for justice. The advent of television provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation that found it ideal for an enigmatic masked man who was in charge of law and order while providing exceptional entertainment in five seasons spanning almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see for the first time the complete three-part episodes beginning to end without standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For Ranger fans, this is the great feast for all Western sagas, telling how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the ambush of Butch Cavendish Gang and how he fell ill back to the health of an Indian friend from his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion a "faithful scout" and names him Kemo-sabe. I've read various interpretations of the word Kemo-sabe, but I'm happy with Tonto's explanation. Reading too much into it just detracts from the story, just like the English translation of 'tonto' from Spanish, which I don't want to reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was quite wise how the story of origin created the mystic of the Lone Ranger as the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all Rangers died in the canyon ambush. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, as it is always turned or hidden to hide his real identity. Even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly; The narrator's voice describes the wild stallion's sterling properties. Will it relate to sterling, silver? I got the biggest kick out of it. Of course, over time, the Lone Ranger episodes today look at how the unsophisticated show was out of origin. Some of them are almost embarrassing, especially when it comes to a Lone Ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of evil to knock a gun out of that owner's hand. And what about the little wave he gives to Tonto when they are backing the evil guys - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what that means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes where Clayton Moore takes the Ranger mask out to make another disguise to mimic another sign of service for the story. He even went under cover once as an actor presenting President Abraham Lincoln to uncover a villain, top hat and all! <br /> <br /> Few fans I encounter know ever that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the show's producers. If you've ever seen the "Happy Days" section where Fonzie idolizes his boyhood heirs, you'll notice it was John Hart listed in the credits. It's actually hard to tell whether or not you see a Hart episode, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore is so characteristic that it is a dead giveaway. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to try some of the last season color sections, you're in for a treat. The reproductions I have seen on VHS are quite beautiful, although I do not know if commercial prints are available. Most of the black and white episodes around have been repackaged by a number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on is no problem. It must, of course, be the three part of origin, and if you do not see anything else, this gives you all the taste and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the West's most famous heroes. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
