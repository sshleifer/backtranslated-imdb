a scary real drama, there is no other drama out there that has scared the scream out of me like this, the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy who is as stupid as he looks, He is a converted Muslim. A reputable businessman who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but has clearly taken Koran's words to a whole new level. By far the plot is Darwyn, an undercover FBI agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of godly things to prevent them from being discovered. The first episode is a little taste of what to follow. Although it is about Islamic terrorists, drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all Muslims are extremists who are comforting to those interested in racism. Considering that half of the terror cell is Islam conversions, it makes you believe that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of. The most chilling drama I've ever seen. The reason it is so chilling is that you never know who your friends, husband or neighbors really are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
