This is a movie about loneliness and how the distance ?? Physically and emotionally - between people tend to stultify relationships. <br /> <br /> The story is simple for the banality: A young man Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf will work in the big city. After trying for a few weeks to find work without success, the burden of having Yusuf living with him is too much for Mahmut. They argue ?? nothing physical, just verbally. Finally Yusuf goes and leaves Mahmut alone again. End of the story ... <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the two men's successors as a family are one of the best on film. Much is said visually; dialogue is used to disseminate disagreement, mistrust, hostility and uncertainty that exist within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, tries in vain to look at different young women around the city as they seek work. The look of his face, which he is faced with, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or wanting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the freest December air, leaving the door open; Mahmut finally comes up from his desk, goes to the door (the whole glass) and cousins ​​just look at each other for what seems too long. Then the Mahmut closes the door and leaves Yusuf in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or Mahmut cleans up Yusuf, courageously and with increased anger; and all the time Yusuf is wasting his time hunting skirts instead of looking seriously at work and spending Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew ?? Yusuf is emotional, sloppy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and demanding control freak: right-handed, left-brain dichotomy played beautifully by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a wrinkle than any word can convey. /> But Mahmut is not completely numb: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him she's gone to Canada with her husband-to-be. Mahmut influences a distant and secure friendship with her ex, and makes sure she is okay with walking. He wants her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the coffee shop where they talked. Later when she calls to say a last goodbye to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly sees as she leaves. The sensitivity of the feeling on his face, which she disappears through a door, is worth the wait. <br /> All in all, this is an excellent job by the two main players and the director Nuri Ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; But life goes slow too much of the time, especially for those who are alone. The camera work is relatively simple too: Select the scene, set the camera and the lighting, and let the actors move across the stage, enter the scene and leave the scene while the camera is still quiet. There were a couple of paneling pictures, some angular scenes, some rural scenes ?? but much of the film is shown as if at a stage with a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. Apart from television and radio music in history, there is no music soundtrack. And there are the many long positions, since the two men sit and watch TV together and / or participate in very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, so I was amused to watch it on some occasions I watched TV, as they also watched TV. The silence of the movie matched the silence of my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); My chair and position matched Mahmut's when he watched TV. Totally annoying, gives me a feeling of almost being there with him ?? And I think I was in a way. <br /> <br /> I don't say anymore because I want you to enjoy the other scenes I haven't described. It's not a movie for everyone. More than any movie I've seen, it shows just how much we die when we are all alone ?? just as we are all alone when we die. Mahmut's face, as it falls to black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long time ... Recommended for serious movie buffs.
