Film noir at best. Seen in the immediate aftermath of World War II (1946), "Crossfire" shows the good, bad and ugly of that time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and therefore automatically perceived through Monty's narrow lens to have been a slacker who came out of the fight against the war. Monty doesn't like people like that. The truth is, Sam was a soldier too, but the truth is something that disappears when you feel right about the ideologies of hate you have been immersed in, and the world is full of filthy things and it's very bad use for your brand of "cleansing". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist in winning soldiers' clothing. The winners of World War II had more than their share also hated, condemned leaders and soldiers too. Some of them were hanged by war crimes, like starting an "aggression war". This movie got its decision makers in trouble when the second sadistic cleansing of America, Joe McCarthy, got his hearings early in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" just to see how good an actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan was no Monty. He was a great, if underrated, under-used actor. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and get a taste of the dark side of post-WWII America. See it for a taste of the good side of the late 40s America. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played Ryan's role, in fact he did when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear".
