This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. Initially, there are standout performances from lovely Debra Paget as princess / dancing girl, from Michael Rennie as the villain, beautiful young Jeffrey Hunter examines crime in his city / state and others. The movie is an exceptionally colorful adventure, and we even see the princess practicing the dance she later performs (for once). She manages to spot Hunter before she learns that he is on her side; Also, photography, costumes from Travilla, Lionel Newman's music and the movie's style are exceptionally fine. Add to this brilliant action, intelligent characterization and fine direction of veteran Harmon Jones of a Gerald Drayson Adams' script set in 1249 AD, and you have the ingredients of a cozy Grecianized near-eastern. But there is much to praise about the unusual and well-developed history here, as there is much more to praise than the movie's fast paced, well-managed physical actions and overall technical aspects. Classically trained actors like Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly found in a "B" movie together; There are also no fascinating sets, a number of locations and a mystery about the quality that is provided here. One way to assess a movie is: "If I was guaranteed to live through the experience, would I choose to go through these events and do those actions?" Since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film is one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated film work. Could it be that American critics are too frequent contempt for women as warriors and thinkers, who in so many other cases have caused closed minds to reject this beautiful film's apparent anti-tyranny and entertainment qualities?
