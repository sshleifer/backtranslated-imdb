This is an incredibly fun action / exploitation 80s rocker. Charles Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey. The bad guys are hilariously bad. The soundtrack, by Jimmy Page, is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street points that is wasted by Bronson and the crew. Crew? Oh, these are the enchanted townspeople who go with Bronson to win back the streets. The whole movie is fun, with the last half hour or so exploding in non-stop action and mayhem. 9.10
