I was actually about 13 years old camping near the McCloud River near Shasta when this movie was filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite in the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia ... the scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stuntman missed the net, there were 20 foot waterfalls about 1/4 mile longer. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I saw it at that time and didn't get it. It was only years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it. It is quite a powerful movie and certainly a fine job at Jan at such a young age. His film career never really took off as expected, but of course he found later success on television. I wish this movie was available because I would love to see it again.
