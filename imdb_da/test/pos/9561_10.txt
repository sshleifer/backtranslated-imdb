This flick was even better than 'Waiting for Guffman'. The great strength of these two films lies in the glorious character of Guest and Levy's second-second troop. If you find this movie boring or meaningless, God helps them, they just haven't got it. It's a mockumentary, something that Guest and Levy has a genius for. At the end of the film, where the guest's southern domestic dog life tells us to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a caboose or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic < <br /> <br /> An ancient Egyptian who has a small ancient Egyptian in his hand, I realized that it is moments like this that make life worth living. Thanks Mr.Guest and Mr.Levy, and God bless you.
