Adam Sandler's movie is my favorite comedy. The silence of the sound is my favorite horror movie. The matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> The only valuable asset this movie has is that it works. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is amazing. At the end of this movie I felt as though I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a good job. I recently rented her first film, Leon (1994), where she played a 12-year-old girl. I think she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress. Well, 5 years later she is still as good an actress. In fact, she is much better. <br /> <br /> Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their character well, they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie. This movie is about a 14 year old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) leaving their hometown of Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> Initially, Portman pulls his mother away from her cousin and friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down in a few years (usually down, can I add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie you will see that the plot is really not so vague or weak, because it is actually very deep. What I say is that the plot is sketched weakly, but then they focus on it to make it strong. And it is very strong, but also plot sequencing is fantastic. And there are a few brilliant scenes that I hope one day will be seen as "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although there are a couple of loopholes, it's still a star game and it really comes together eventually.
