We went to see Manna from Heaven, my husband, two friends, and I and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are fun, the story is entertaining and as much as real life. I think that's what I liked the most, just seeing something credible, no murder, no sci-fi, just good, pure fun. It's something you can take your children or older parents to and don't worry about. How many of them are around more !!
