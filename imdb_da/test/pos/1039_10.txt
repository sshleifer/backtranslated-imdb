... a true geek girl's dream: high technology, loud drama, smart guys, steaming sex and big explosions. (VERY BIG explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in Oppenheimer's role that the ties of REAL Oppenheimer sound are odd: apparently he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's triumph and tragedy is one of the most stirring dramas of the 20th century, and this film stands as a model for what docu-drama should be: facts can speak for themselves, while fictitious parts are used to reinforce and fill the record, not to draw attention to themselves. An interesting fact: Some of the technical details used were first pre-classified, and it is also of particular interest. A must-see!
