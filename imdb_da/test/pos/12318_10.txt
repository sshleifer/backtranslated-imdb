John Huston completed his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies I've ever seen. For his parting, he decided to adapt James Joyce's beautiful short story "The Dead" and not only made one of the most faithful literature-to-movie adaptations yet, but he also made a movie that surpassed much more than 20 years later. of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie a few years ago, as a university student, I was amazed at the screen and marveled at all aspects of the movie: acting, screenwriting, direction, costumes, settings, music, movie. Thinking about it now, I still can't think of anything I criticize it for. Huston just knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit should also go to Tony Huston. He knew better than to interfere with a text that is not only perfection itself, but already visual enough for the cinema. Father and son let the story breathe and rejoice in the long, fascinating talks between characters and in meaningful silences. Donal McCann also deserves credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I had never seen him in movies before, nor have I seen him afterwards, but he gave one of the most moving ideas I've ever seen. <br /> All in all, The Dead is a great movie experience, from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent.
