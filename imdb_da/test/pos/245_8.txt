Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor film starring Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful showgirl, Rusty, who works at a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go for oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club's comedian. They hate all the oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find one, all three will succeed, they believe. Rusty auditions and wins the role of a maid to a magazine - she starts in front of the other participants, because the magazine's owner (Kruger) sees a similarity between Rusty and the girl he once loved, which turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. When she becomes the front girl, the world opens for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway become true. Danny wants her to succeed, but at the same time he realizes she's lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has exciting dance tracks and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita is at her best to play both Rusty in the present and her grandmother earlier. For such a sexy, desirable, beautiful woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of dominant men. None of this ever showed on the screen, nor the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did for life. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but gets lots of chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very gracious and fun as the internal cartoon and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with no dull spots. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty should choose between a successful career and the man she loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays in the movie, talks about getting married, she is warned by her boss not to be too necessary for the modeling industry. We are not told if Rusty continues his career or goes back to work at Danny's - but all the signs seemed to point to the Brooklyn club. Why couldn't she have both? Nevertheless, you can't beat "Cover Girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, great music, great energy, great performances and the most amazing asset, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
