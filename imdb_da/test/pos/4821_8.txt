Rarely does a movie sequel be seen that surpasses or even corresponds to the magnitude of the original predecessor. Such a movie is VIrtual Encounters 2. <br /> <br /> It's about a few guys in college selling virtual sex to the entire campus. If you like to see naked chickens, this one delivers. Six-foot-long Chrissy Styler is a great test and you will today dream of her if you ever have the luck to catch the untouched version. She has only the right amount of body glitter in her several naked scenes, and her giant cans seem to be real. (= Giddyup! <br /> <br /> With the exception of James Cameron's "Aliens" Francis For Coppola's "The Godfather Part II" and - of course - Zucker's "Airplane 2", this is the only sequel to movie history taking a classic movie and enhances it. <br /> <br /> It is criminal how this movie was ignored by the academy, Nikki Fritz and the broad-minded first (as well as the brunette who gets a knock at the end ) all deserved best supportive keys. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Hollywood !!!
