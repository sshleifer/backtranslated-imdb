The Romanian cinema is a little known from Romania. No directors from Romania were informed by the international public, as some from other countries from Eastern Europe such as Hungary, Czekos, or Yugoslavia succeeded. One of the few great instructors in Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who since 35 led a great movie 'Reconstituirea' - quickly taken out of the circuit of Communist censorship. After the film still a reference to the Romanian cinema, Pintilie was not allowed to freely create in Romania until the Communist government fell in 1989. 'Furia' reminds me of Pintilie's film 35 years ago. The title means 'The Rage' and I can't imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. It's about a lost generation. While in the classic Pintilie is the root of evil in repression and lies in the communist regime, young people must deal with the emergence of the subculture and the moral filth that filled the void left by the totalitarian ruler. The end is tragic and painfully expected. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-aimed and the play is good. Without too much complexity, it manages to create an emotional link between the characters and the viewer. One would say that some situations are similar to '8 Miles' or 'The Fast and the Furious' - but look at the date of production! This film was made at the same time, if not before the western comrades. If this really is the first movie by director Dan Munteanu that IMDB says, it's an excellent debut. In any case, a good movie can compete and sell well in the Western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that will successfully and well-distributed international cinema scene. <br/> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
