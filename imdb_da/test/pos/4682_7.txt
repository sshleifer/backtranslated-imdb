My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably mixed with the events that occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and went back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between watching a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or having lunch), and the feeling of relief and gratitude I felt at that time was huge. Consequently, my enjoyment of "Italian job" was probably far out of proportion to its actual value. <br /> <br /> I still picked it up on DVD a few weeks ago and saw it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is widely available if you have a taste for today's production values ​​applied to older movie plots and themes. <br /> <br /> Originally, this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most agile, textured and aurally pleasing tracks around. IJ opens with a blurry, witty, vibrant event that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brushwork and quiet moments - it won me completely from opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chasing, pulsating soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the police and started making audio tracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs here along with some pop song remakes ranging from "all to" to "inspired". For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> On the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He is the weakest "big" actor in the movie, but that's because the rest of the supporters are so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in one piece. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron are all in solid, fat-free performances. Norton mostly seems to call it in (rumors have it that he wouldn't really be in the movie), but he's still a natural self at 1/2 power. My quarrel with casting and acting is with the "Wrench" sign, which seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to have been carved in the movie, and he has a little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although one can blame some of it on the party's size and the character's "late walk"). If I were a cynical kind, would I imagine who the actor slept with in order to be put in this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen ... Production values, camera work, stunts, plot ... everything boils down quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty smoothly (except for "wrench" characters, see above). <br /> <br /> The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying large and small plot payments along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he has just lost the surprise element. Wahlberg continues to cold dick Norton with a right cross and asks him, "Were you surprised?" Hmmm, you might be there ...) Of course requires some degree of "suspension of disbelief" for work, but if you just relax and go with it (and don't think too much about mechanics to blow up a safe underwater job, or the likelihood that someone is capable of to chop and manipulate LA traffic through a laptop, etc.), you will have a fun trip. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": It's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it's not trying to be anything else. It is not good enough for an "8", but I would give it a "7.5".
