Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, dropped into a desert country, on what seems the last stop on his journey. He does not know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign is listed for him. After an immediate consideration of his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. He then goes into another world than the one he came from. <br /> <br /> As soon as Andreas is introduced to his new job as an accountant, he discovers that his surroundings are a little too uniform to his liking. When he takes his first lunch break, he immediately notices that everyone in the city is wearing gray suits. On the same day, he sees a fellow human being died on some fences, which resembles a suicide. The strange thing is that the city's folk music does not take into account this terrible act and goes on as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitized and their ability to distinguish anything from anything human or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle down, he is invited to join his colleagues at a local night club. The club seems to be a step away from being as exciting as a bingo night. And when Andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. As he tells these beliefs to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet room begins to pronounce words that have been on Andreas's mind all the time. By realizing that this man is thinking about what he is, he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future reference. The plot predictably predicts with Andreas who wants an escape. He's looking for the man he once followed ... hoping he could make him become human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This Norwegian movie is something everyone should see as it keeps the answer to the big question! What's the meaning of life? (well enough). The film outlines the dark realities of what has become the working man of today (or woman). The only purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. It tries to show that small clich√© things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing the sound, the moment you are a step away from becoming a robot . The end of the movie repeats what happens when it's too late to escape the everyday routine you're used to. You begin to adopt the pun if 'it's not ink, don't fix it' and become too good to risk change. <br /> <br /> Although this movie should not be taken as a realism ... its message is more than right. The lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and as Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can be. The director Jens Lien has composed a film that would have failed in the hands of other directors. This is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and I'm eagerly awaiting to see what he's doing next. <br /> <br /> The main role played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfect cast. As a representative of the average Joe, Trond gives a good catalyst for making this image dark humorous. The supporting actors also do an appropriate job, and for some reason I feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this movie, as most of the supporting caste required their plays to be numb. <br /> <br /> The result for this movie was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and it gave a very bleak but welcome feeling to the movie. <br /> <br /> Seen for a release date in the UK on May 25, 2007, I'll definitely relive this experience on the big screen. This movie has got its way in my top 10 ... now quickly becomes my top 20! It has some shocking scenes and is darkly humorous all the way through ... A MUST-SEE !!
