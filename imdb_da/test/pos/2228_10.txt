I remember watching this movie in my late teens or early twenties on television - probably HBO. I saw it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I can't remember much of the story. I remember that our whole group of us agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. When it was over, our bellows damaged so much grin. My father worked in a hospital so it did better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the party in the TV list, I look to see if this is there too. To my dismay it is never. Even though I loved the party, I think this one is more fun. Peter Sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. Why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but it seems that no one under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. I would buy it in a second if they ever release it to DVD.
