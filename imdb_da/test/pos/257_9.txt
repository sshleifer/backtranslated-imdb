Watched this movie at a local festival, Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida. What a nice movie. A simple, uncomplicated moral story of a young foster-free young man who has to take responsibility for his actions. It was neither pretentious nor flashy, my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I was not embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family movie and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. The film did not continue to win the surprisingly top festival for best film and best director. Ten out of ten.
