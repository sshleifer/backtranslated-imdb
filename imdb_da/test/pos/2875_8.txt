Well, I'm a few days late, but what the hell ....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "No Evil" was .... ABUSE. The movie is actually pretty good. There is certainly an abundance of blood, gore and action in the movie with a modest amount of tension. It belongs to the good ole slasher days in the late 70s and early 80s. Think that "Madman" meets Leatherface with a touch of Norman Bates and you get a good feel for this flick. Although the national expert is thin on plot (most horror movies are), it does something in the violence / methods of killing, doing, excitement and the fact that Kane does a good job of playing the much-disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob picks his eyes off his victims using only his fingers and hiding them in large jars. Why?? You just have to see it and see (pun). There are some movie elements lifted from other horror films, especially Psycho, TCM, & Madman, but they are not obvious. Finally, the national expert does not really go into the area that we have not seen before and given long ago, NOW is no "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but it certainly deserves a look imo. <br /> <br /> BloodStone's Recommendation: Take a matinee view of "See No Evil" Bloodstone's Rating: 7.5 / 10
