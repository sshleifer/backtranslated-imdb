See three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both fantastic movies and will give an extra dimension to the Three Colors: Red. Red is a great movie. It can be enjoyed in a single view, and actually the climax of the movie is very powerful in the first view. But see it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each view. With the first view, you understand that the movie is a brilliant mind. With each extra view you find yourself discovering that it is actually a genius work. Red is supposed to symbolize brotherhood in the French flag. History turns the theme of brotherhood into angles that you would never believe. The fraternity facets shared by the various characters are as deep as you usually hunt. If you're used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass movies, you can find Red a little slow. You may find yourself looking at a screen full of intensity that you do not fathom ... and yawning, wondering what the excitement is about. This is not a thoughtless, vicarious experience. Everything is not explained to you. You must think as you see. You should see ... not just look. Fantastic movie ... one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful movie gallery.
