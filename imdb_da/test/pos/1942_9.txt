Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not just his) is huge. You really want to believe in him because his body language and performance fit perfectly with the person. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. Besides Feck, what role does it make very good by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported and that is exactly what I think is what makes the choices so difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mothers. I really enjoyed seeing. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80's feeling, it's the one you should see. I am the same as I did not know before.
