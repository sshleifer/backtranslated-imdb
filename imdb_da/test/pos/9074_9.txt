Five Medical Students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio, William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley, Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle, Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus, Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) experiment with secret near death and compliance experiences for medical and personal information. . One by one, each doctor's heart is stopped and revived. <br /> <br /> During temporary deaths, each presents bizarre visions, including forgotten childhood memories. Their feedbacks are like children's nightmares. The revived students are disturbed by remembering enchanting actions they had committed or had done against them. As they experience afterlife, they bring real life experiences back to the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories intensify dramatically; So much, some are physically overcome. Thus, they deepen and transcend deeper into life-long experiences trying to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this movie was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts & Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult-acting career. In addition to the plot being extremely exciting, the excitement builds on a dramatic climate and the script is tight and convincing, making all the young actors "Flatliners", what is now an all-star cult semi-sci-fi excitement. Who knew 17 years ago that the film carriers of this young group of actors would skyrocket? I suppose director Joel Schumacher did.
