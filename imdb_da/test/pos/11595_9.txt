Greetings again from the dark. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of a man's struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to see in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave some doubts as to what is going on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused, so it is very effective to explain why he wants what he wants. Instead of forcing us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question that has been asked is: What is love? At every turn we see people in love, seeking love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the movie moving even though it is filmed mostly in one room. Support support is wonderful, and we really feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.
