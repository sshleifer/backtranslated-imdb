I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost every day. There are good and bad in each race, why make them all out to be bad? This applies to all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he was educated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before returning to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the three years he was in high school, and he kept in touch with us the year after graduation. He was a kind and gentle soul, he could be fun loving, and he could be serious when times were right. I wasn't very old when he left our house, but I still remember all the times he helped me with my homework, as my own brother couldn't be bothered. He even learned class 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the movie, and the suicide of the constable cross is a guilty acknowledgment as far as I'm concerned. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the native society, but also in the white society. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks as the police do, I knew the person inside and what he was like a PERSON, not an Indian!
