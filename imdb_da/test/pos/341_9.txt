In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed 68,000 lives since 1983. Human rights groups have said that as a result of the war is more than a million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. Influence on children and families trapped in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by the renowned Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winning several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the Civil War is only the backdrop to the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human war expense becomes quite clear, and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context pointing the global arms dealers as a source of misdemeanor. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed in southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting that reflects the Sri Lanka terrain, the film tells a moving story of an adopted 9-year-old girl who goes out to find his real mother in the middle of fighting in Sri Lanka. The game with deep sense and expressiveness of P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is brought up by a loving middle-class family with two younger brothers, after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out and left her in a red Cross camp. In a loving feedback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran) a television personality, married to ease their adoption of the darker shining little girl. <br /> <br /> Young Amudha has no idea that she has been adopted until it has jumped on her suddenly on her ninth birthday, according to her parents' prior agreement. While she is playing, Thiru tells her almost in an actual tone that "you are not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Distraught she asks who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, etc. But few answers are coming. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the Tamil separatists. The family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, which are mainly dealt with by Ratnam, although an order in which the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish. <br /> <br /> Of course, a Peck on the cheek is a Bollywood style movie, which means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong ideas of leading actors; However, I found musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman against the mood of the movie with their sleek, high production techniques and fast-paced music video style editing. Yet, the persuasive character and honesty of history is what is said to exceed the limitations of the film. The Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich√©d and commercial, but A Peck on the Cheek is both a movie of entertainment and one that solves serious problems. The fact that it successfully extends the line between art and commerce is not a rejection, but a tribute.
