Don't forget if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a little hackneyed and sometimes not convincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fever is a loving and very good story with good morals. Having achieved modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943)', young Taylor, aged 12, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Although filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small town on the English landscape, and full advantage of Technicolor photography is to present the vibrant and beautiful landscapes of blue sky and green bushes. . Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with incredible intentions whose relationship with young Velvet regains his dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although he is noticeably struggling in an order to confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is sober as the surly but passionate young man to prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had these enchanting violet eyes, because at this young age her training ability was quite limited. Her more emotional sequences, where she shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strikes one as being quite hollow and the close-fitting expression that simply "believers" will achieve everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by virtually any unmemorable inspirational sports film ever made. Nonetheless, Taylor is bright and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvet's mother, once a famous athlete who not only swam the English channel, but was lovingly educated by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not told about this until the film's last second, with Mrs Brown correctly deciding that the young man should first develop his own sense of decency rather than exploiting his late-father's memory for financial gain which he would undoubtedly have done at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie reaches its climax at Grand National Sweepstakes, where at last minute Velvet decided to ride its own horse, Pi, in world-famous competition. Under the direction of a Latvian man, she continues as expected to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she tumbled from the horse before being allowed to dismantle (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is extremely well-designed, effectively capturing the nerve tension of the nerve-racking pre-race seconds and the confusion of the event that puts us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting with anxiety on someone to to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double that does most of the difficult riding - in several scenes we can clearly see a creepy man in a gem - but the positive message remains the same. I bet that 'National Velvet' has created the imagination of millions of young girls over the past sixty years, and it's the power to inspire has fallen a little over time.
