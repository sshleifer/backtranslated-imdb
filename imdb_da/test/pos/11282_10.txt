This is not a story. It is a bunch of psychic needles that reach your subconscious. If you are waiting for a story, you will be bored. But if you give it yourself, you will be within that dream world within 10 minutes. The vague, but disturbing images of pain and torture in a deserted landscape make room for your own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsating light, and deep dark shadows, all reach your subconscious to fill this space. I found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television. It was like dreaming with the eyes wide open. A strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... it touched me deeply and marked me for living. It freed my mind and gave me one of the rare experiences of loss of personality and merging with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A violent freedom though .... Not a good movie, but a very strong and unforgettable one. Literally, my text has no spoilers. For me, the great surprise of this movie was the incredible intensity of it, and the description of this can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie as you see it, the better.
