A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, sits on his paths, taking a boy's scout troop after his predecessor leaves. Jordan takes on the package most of the time to learn what the boys like so he can revive his fluttering radio program that loses the appeal of the younger set. He is rough in the first place with the boys, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old who forms an association with the older man, who is anything but retarded. Does it matter to Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and entertaining old-fashioned movie.
