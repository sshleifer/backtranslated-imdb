I love B-horror movies. However, I am generally not a big fan of "so stupid fun" movies. I HAD to judge this so much simply because Death Bed: the bed that eats is so one of a kind and so original. There are lots of question marks, lots of plot holes, and the WTF factor is cranked up to 11, but I really wasn't bored in a second. I really couldn't call it scary at any time. Every minute I told myself "what the hell is this bed / movie going to do next!" I saw this with a friend who is by no means a fan of horror or B-movies, and even she was beautiful in it. The effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good. It keeps a very consistent and smooth tone in most of the movie (albeit an incredibly ridiculous consistency) and the play was not terrible. I can see from the point that there are some discrepancies in the bed's actions that make the suspension of faith amazing almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that it didn't really disturb me. Seriously for me, this movie hit the rich one I will not only forget, but I guarantee that I will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future. Know any other movies in the lifeless objects that eat the crowd? absolutely fantastic.
