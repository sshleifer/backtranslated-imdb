This is an extraordinary movie. It's a lot of comedy, a drama, some excitement. The dialogue is exquisite. Most of the actors and actors were very famous in their time and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone even if you do not normally watch older movies. They are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents. <br /> <br /> One correction to comment on other users is that two people, not one, are reported to die in the accident. Perhaps the unfortunate two are a reflection of what the author considers important in life. The movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> The story is before its time, but it doesn't lose the quality of an older movie. Time and effort was used to perfect the camera's vision and soundtrack, some modern filmmakers tend to forget.
