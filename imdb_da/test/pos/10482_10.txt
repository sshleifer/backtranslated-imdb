The dead spots and the superficiality of the card of "Out of Africa" ​​buried almost any interest I might have had to read Isaac Dinesen. So when my brother bought me "Babette's Feast" and knew it was based on a Dinesen story, I was not driving to the VCR. But as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is set) is not Africa; The cold mist that gathers on the camera's shots is not inviting. The cold, forbidden sea; the heavy, gray clouds the pale, icy green rocks - translated into difficulties showing on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel pulls the curtain. The sharpest is Bodil Kjer as Philippa; In the midst of the myriad merit of this movie is the most memorable face. It stands as a card that before us puts the honorable ministry on its priesthood apostolate as a maze of cloudy fjords, where the complications of her congregation's persistence and commitment are hanging like shining depictions. I collect it is Dinesen's point, how the world is drawn inexplicably to Christian engagement when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because he fears he will never measure up to the rules and rigors of her little religious clip) and he turns back to find his mistress, whom he considers to be the greatest cook on the continent. I reckon that Christ answers doubts and regrets for those who give up worldly success (Philippa's sister Martina turns away from a visitor's poetry (Jean-Philippe Lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpart to the frugality surrounded by his discovery) to an opera star, the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks the sanctuary serving for two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs for only God and those closest to him to testify. But it is Axel who weaves the sharpness of these peoples' lives with Martin's voice and Babette Hersant's table and affects an opulence you would never expect from a film about victims, faith and religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> What sets this movie apart from other religious films is its worn-out humor. "Babette's Feast", that is, the banquet itself - a posthumous holiday of the minister's 100th birthday - is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comical moments of an ensemble of actors who are unsurpassed in their subtlety. It's just this stupid comedy that enriches the solemn feelings of closing. Together they rarely do anything with pious movies. They leave a believing tremulous hope and unexpectedly determined and humiliated.
