In strangers on a train, it is obvious from the beginning that playboy mess Robert Walker has designated Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a couple of murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, he is a tennis pro, but not very tall. Enough enough for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker probably knows that Granger will at least be fascinated enough with the possibility that if the two, perfected strangers, committed murder at parties, that the other would be called by their death. Although Granger is dismissed by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this movie is that you can see in the show he gives that Granger can only submit to temptation. In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger's wife, who has been two timing and even pregnant by another man, he expects Granger to again murder Walker's father so Walker can inherit his property. Today, Walker had to be called a trust fund child and a rather malicious one. Alfred Hitchcock instructed Walker to his career role, ironically in his last complete movie. Walker died the following year, with most of my son John finished. Hitchcock also doesn't do too badly for Farley Granger. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger bends to commit murder of people who have never done anything for him, the excitement. Stranger's On A Train is also characterized by great editing, first in the tennis match, where Granger must finish the match and run Walker before he plant evidence that judges Granger on the crime scene. And also in the last climax with a struggle on a running carousel between Walker and Granger. Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at its best, it should not be missed and should be necessary to watch the movie classes study editing.
