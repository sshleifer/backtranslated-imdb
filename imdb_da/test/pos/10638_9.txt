If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's movie "LA PIANISTE" is the ultimate degree in the personification of perversion, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellineks novel "LA PIANISTE" ( as the film was based on) is twice as "abominable", "disgusting", "disgusted" and even more fascinating - although there may not be enough words to translate the artistic level that Isabelle Huppert has reached here, over all others deadly actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano play / dubbing that an actor could deliver? <br /> <br /> In the short story as in the movie, there are two major antagonists of "heroine" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced Annie Girardot, in part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria herself. The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that encourages and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and lets say that it is impossible to hold today without danger for a mental breakdown. "La Pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and delicate problem: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to one (you think) you love. We tend to believe that our own sexual fantasies should be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may prove to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut (?) Teaches the lesson in the most painful and humiliating ways. It should be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and acclaimed writers in Austria and Europe (well, now she has a Nobel Prize!) And that autobiographical passages can be derived from her novel when she herself was a pianist and had an allegedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also contains long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence, so you can understand how she became who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film and forced us to wonder how she got that way (we don't know all of Erika Kohut out there?). But he retains much of the book's substance in his film: intolerable honesty to the point where most secretive "terrible" emotions arise painfully - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. All of them unmistakably human. I thought "La Pianiste" was an in-depth movie, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's just what I'm asking for movies. It also made me buy and be excited about the book, discover a great writer I hadn't read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for easy entertainment, stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10
