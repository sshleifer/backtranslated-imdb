OK, I don't like this to be the typical gay love life, but since when are equal romances in real life as they are on the screen? This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a rebellion to see Hugo Weaving playing a sex-occupied gay real estate agent who uses his client houses for his trysts with the fiery Darren (Tom Hollander). And having seen him in priscilla, the desert queen only the day before, he's probably one of the safest in their masculinity actors around. :) Yet the plot flew smoothly and the male binding scenes were a hoot. Thumbs up! 8.10
