In the year 2000 (remember, it's two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous work of art on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a story of a rag-tag band of other stringers (hence the title) that is pulled into the starter's position due to an order of bad oysters. <br /> <br /> Due to the motivational direction of both director Robert Lieberman and Buffalo Bill's last minute QB, Dan "Give 'em hell" Heller (depicted by Canadian actor Gil Bellows) often Super Bowl snake Bitten Bills finds in the ultimate position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that can only bring the fine sport of football, and an overall theory that underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worth see every moment as it appears on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of Costume Designer's first name, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
