Although there are errors in the view of homosexuals, this film will shed light on the viewer on myths and inaccuracies regarding AIDS. Despite the depressing issue, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys and makes you laugh and cry. Very well-liked by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it is an entertaining and intelligent movie for the whole family. But remember to get Kleenex ready!
