A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly because I was confused by the title. I assumed it was about the influence of drug culture on film production, but no, it is a far more far-reaching and intelligent movie than you might expect. Demme has done a good job of encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. From 'Easy Rider' and the collapse of studio influence through all the introspective 'real life' films, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually, and artistically, through to the beginning of blockbuster and the return of governments to money men and their studies. As one who saw the 'real life' films from Britain and the rest of Europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary American films of the 70s and sad that the successor to the sequel is so much of the order of the day, it was a most fascinating film. Interview clips are measured (thanks to DVD, the full interviews are available as extras!) And the movie clips are well thought out. Also, as one who has just caught up with, 'Joe', I am impressed that this important little movie gets its well-deserved access here.
