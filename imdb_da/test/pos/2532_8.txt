I have been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled upon "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is just as good or better than "the city of God". <br /> <br /> The action, film and music surveillance make this movie a unique experience. I haven't been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the tough reality obsessed with the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Anything you want to see, but nothing you want to sleep on.
