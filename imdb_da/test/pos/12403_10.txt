This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City." It has a plot twist after another with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman, and James Remar delivers really good performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't like movies that "go all the way" in terms of violence, don't see the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. I can't believe it came from B-Movie King Roger Corman. This movie is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. Highly recommended.
