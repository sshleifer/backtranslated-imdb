This film is about the crew of a spaceship that strengthens land on a strange light planet with three suns. Among the passengers are convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the wreck survivors receive their rents, an eclipse of all three suns occurs. Shortly after, scary creatures begin to appear and begin to pick up crew members one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick enters his own when his eyebrows have been surgically shining and giving him night vision. The crew must trust him to try to get them safe. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish movie where the color of the sky changes scene after scene and gives it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, really threatening, but forced to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also an underlying humor in his performance, which also adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role that Vin distinguishes in, the anti-hero, whose character is not as one-dimensional as first appears. I can't imagine anyone else in this role it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!
