This movie is not the most embarrassing of all times, but it is a good example of a campy eighty screaming game - low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The principle is interesting and fun, and the three evil children play their parts well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown puts her talents early in her career. This movie will not be seen by many, but for fans of the 80's horror it is a must.
