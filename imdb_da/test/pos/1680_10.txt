You Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variant of John Huston's seminal film, Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi (1955) paying a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence. Also, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the robbery in Rififi as much as in the Asphalt Jungle. In the end, in my opinion, Rififi (1955) is a slightly better film than the Asphalt Jungle (1950). Remarkable Noir image that defines the French cinema from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Spartacus (1960) may have been the one who broke down the infamous black list, but in my opinion, Rififi (1955) was the movie that began to divide each other's unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First five-year film for Jules Dassin, who was the victim of the McCarthy Communist hunt in the late 40s to the early 50s. He received some kind of retaliation when Rififi (1955) became a success around France and Europe. Thus, the toxic Hollywood blacklist can withstand a great deal that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film in Dassin's career because it not only restored its name but also gave him a chance to make films. Jules Dassin gave the film world and its ever-growing audience a masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is unusual and the direction of the actors is flawless. Builds tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin came full circle in the Film Noir genre by controlling his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). Market the end of Dassin's film-making period when he was involved in Noir images. <br /> <br /> Rififi (1955) is the number one movie in a thirty plus film arsenal to director Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in acting, filmography, instruction, editing and writing. Not a movie to leave your place for a minute because there is always something memorable going on. As brilliant as anything by Jean Pierre Melville, who was a master of this type of movie. Masterpieces such as Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in film history. The one fascinating aspect of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up much of the 118 minute duration. The protagonists plan and perform the jewel in the same way as a film director prepares for pre-production, production and post-production of a movie. Shows how hard a Jewel heist as in Rififi (1955) is in committing and why very few would do anything like that. The fact that the scene hardly contains a clutter as in other hoist films makes this scene even bigger. Close as one can get to have a perfect sequence in a movie image. <br /> <br /> Lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in an area of ​​absolute realism. Any dialogue or music would destroy any tension and excitement the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding movie experience. Now filmmakers and producers will use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of lack of confidence in a mainstream filmmaker's patience. Maintains a degree of consistency that never lets down. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high voltage level is what makes the heist sequence cross to perfection. The director achieves excitement in the heist sequence, which rarely corresponds to most robotic scenes from hoist film. Jean Servais and the rest of the main players contribute to the excitement with some low keys. Getting excitement set in a scene is a task that few are able to do. Rififi's robbery sequence (1955) reaches a Hitchcockian level of voltage and voltage. Many filmmakers from the years after Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) have been influenced if they are not inspired by it. One filmmaker influenced was Jean Pierre Melville (originally elected to Rififi's director) who used variations of the heist sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker influenced was Stanley Kubrick, who made a similar theme film in The Killing (1956). Quentin Tarantino, whose debut feature Reservoir Dogs (1992) was also inspired by this film. Other film directors influenced are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. ... You Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable to Bob le Flambeur (1955) in many ways. One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville instructed groundbreaking films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Two, each movie involves an aging criminal planning and performing a daring hoist. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi end up fatalistic. Four, each movie shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as movie greats. <br /> <br /> Part of Rififi's charm is the colorful characters surrounding the history of Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most of the violence is implicit and yet brutal. The main characters led by Tony le Stephanois adhere to a strong outdated code of honor, reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes Tony le Stephanoi's role with its cynical appearance and tired appearance. You Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became a favorite of mine the moment I saw it on the big screen from the beginning to the end.
