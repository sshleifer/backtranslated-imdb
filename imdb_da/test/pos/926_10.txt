Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993, the idea was to portray how human relationships are in the world today, going from Blue (a crafted visual masterpiece on a woman's life) from White (A visual comedy film about marriage) and finally arriving at Red (A masterpiece dealing with human interaction). <br /> <br /> While I don't want to spoil the step I can easily say, Red is the best movie from the 1990's because it has one of the strongest messages in a script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie begins a bit slowly but finds the rhythm early enough to keep you hooked throughout the movie. The performances are perfect, sublime. since the characters are completely realistic, and they are not clich√© in any way, and you cannot expect less from the actors and you are not disappointed ... seriously, I think Jean Louis Tringtignat deserves an Oscar node at least. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing, it is one of the best musical scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also excellent, he got an Oscar key for it (and deserved to win). Overall, the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people who love foreign cinema and people who don't. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> How did the terrible Pulp Fiction ed this masterpiece in Cannes beyond my understanding
