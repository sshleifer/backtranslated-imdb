I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had some curiosity about it, being directed by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real father, Martin Sheen. I love watching a movie about a father-son relationship involving a spouse's father and son. Of course, there is an instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense, knowing they are actually related. Of course, it helps that the two are both fantastic actors. I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think it is Emilio's most intense role - that I mostly recall him from the Mighty Ducks series - and I was very impressed. Talent really drives that family. And Kathy Bates steals the movie in an Oscar-worthy performance. She needed my heartbeat with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - The beautiful actress from the "Father of the Bride" films - is also very good and keeps her own among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit stadiumy, with dialogue that is naturally geared to the scene, but it didn't bother me. This is not supposed to be an action movie; this is a sign study. And for a movie based on a game, it never gets too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, recalls his days in Vietnam, we actually see his terrible memories come to life. <br /> <br /> The movie is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental. In the end, I expected all conflicts to be resolved, and the family would be hunky-dory, but that was not how it turned out. The end made me cry without resorting to the standard Hollywood melodrama. It proves that reality is much more gripping than what Hollywood can evoke. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a beautiful and powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that turn your socks off ... please check this undervalued gem. Hopefully someday Martin and Emilio will unite Charlie and they will all make a big movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
