Excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible. You can see that the producers were having some problems getting screens on computer screens just right - it all makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good music selection rounds off the film nicely. <br /> <br /> It's good, and David Suchet's presence adds a lot of weight to the course. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood is right up there with the best of them. Fortunately, the "human drama" aspect has not been exaggerated, as is often the case with this type of film. The human suffering is depicted in perfect balance with the actual flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And of course, the movie confirms what many of us suppose, nevertheless: Weather Sprayers often do not get it right! :)
