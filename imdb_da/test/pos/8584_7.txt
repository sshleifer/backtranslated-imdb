I suppose there is some revisionist history on the way here, but one surely comes away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a credibility calling on his people to violence from the moment Congo declared independence. His inability to control his people and his decision to involve Soviet help to get his military back in line was, of course, what became involved in the United States and led to his murder. But by replacing him with Mobutu, the United States did not solve anything. They made the situation just as bad. Well behaved with excellent filmography and an exciting score. It is definitely worth seeing.
