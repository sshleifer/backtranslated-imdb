Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her and expects to "clean the fog" in their lives. Joline turns her marriage into an important commitment at the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very much supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her in the border with Mexico. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she cannot change her decision while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and begins to dance her, and eventually life goes on. This film is very unpredictable and has a very different story. I think it's an independent production. In some parts, it is a bit slow and boring, but there are some dialogues that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Rebel's At√© o Fim (`Rebels Until the End ') <br /> <br />
