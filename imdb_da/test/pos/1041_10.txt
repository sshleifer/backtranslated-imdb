This is the best work I've ever seen on TV. The story is convincing - the more it is true. The authors did their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. The action is great. This should be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was unusual. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. Some years ago I contacted someone involved in the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told that they were not planning to release it at VHS (at that time). This was a BBC production and ran in the US at the American Playhouse. There is such interest in seeing this - just hard to believe nobody can make it available.
