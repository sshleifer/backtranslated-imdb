I first saw the Korean version of Daisy. It came across as a simple love story that flew nicely from start to finish. I saw it 3 times when I waited for my copy of the director's cut to come forward. <br /> <br /> Then I got DC and looked at it. Wow! I think it's the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen. Great how detailed the editing is in both versions! DC is laid out as a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version. The variations between both versions are so drastic, it works like two completely different movies. I thought I would be worn out watching the movie again, so it was just looking for the added scenes. That was not the case. It really felt like I was watching a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> While DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you will be pressured to find out where or what has changed. 2 seconds chopped out here. Another added there. A whole scene added here. Another deleted there. In both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reorganized. In some scenes, the entire line of dialogue was replaced or changed - while the scene itself was untouched. Even simple sound effects were added / omitted from each version - greatly affecting the mood of the movie, and sometimes even changing the result of a scene. What stands out as a tender moment in the Korean version is a sad, gloomy one in DC. The endings of both versions allow for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end a lot differently and were designed that way. I suppose most people will acquire the director's cut of the film and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. Same movie, but different feelings. I think there is a deluxe 3-DVD version that contains both parts of the movie - not safe. <br /> <br /> The versions compliment each other so well that I, as a couple, will see Daisy more often than I do any of my other favorite Korean movies. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a lovely love story that I would see once for a while. The director's cut, I want to see maybe once or twice, never again when I find the pacifier boring. But they just go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I would say see the Korean version first. Then see the instructor's intersection to help fill in the gaps in the story that you were curious about. <br /> <br /> Editing is the real star of the movie.
