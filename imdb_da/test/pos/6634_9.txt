Extremely squeezed view of a war situation, where the couple from Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The depiction of the fighters as faceless, overriding authorities is often captured in sublime surreal images and draws interesting parallels with Orwell's 1984, although Bergman whatsoever concludes this connection on a personal level of a slowly growing conjugal war. Therefore, countless fundamental and philosophical issues in relation to Eve and Jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and dangers of the outbursts open an abyss inside, which was too hard covered by lambs before. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civil conventions.
