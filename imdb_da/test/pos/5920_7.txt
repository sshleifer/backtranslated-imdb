"In 1927, a young man, alone in a single motorcycle, flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the North Atlantic to Le Bourget Field in Paris at a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. Triumph of mind, body and spirit , Charles A. Lindbergh has influenced the lives of everyone on earth - because in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight, the aerial age became a reality. This is the story of that flight. "/> <br /> Billy Wilder adapts to Charles A. Lindbergh's Pulitzer Award-winning novel of the same name, in what is the re-creation of Lindbergh's historic sunrise in 1927. Backed by a significantly strong lead performance by James Stewart (himself a pilot) like Lindberg, and featuring an intelligent manuscript from Wilder and Wendell Mayes is the Spirit of St. Louis a sincere story told. <br /> <br /> As you sometimes threaten to become a monotonous movie, Wilder keeps it using flashbacks for Lindbergh's life. Having told to build the event, such as the danger that arises as Nungesser and Coli lacks {never to be found} while attempting the same turn in reverse, we learn things like how he is going to buy his first flight and his work on flying circus. This is all in relation to the understanding of the man and his obvious passion for flight. This also helps give us a complete picture of Lindbergh, so that we sit with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey. Huge isolation {his only company is an escape} and chronic fatigue, this is where Stewart perfectly reproduces Lindbergh's devotion to the task. Aided by a fantastic score by Franz Waxman and Academy Award nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's films show that they are an engaging human interest story that has a thorough professional production. 10.7
