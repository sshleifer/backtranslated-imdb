As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really expected this movie before it was released ... I wasn't disappointed. "Nightbreed" is a horse of different colors. Rich in the underlying decay of Western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to look into his world of unprecedented horror, but show us the other side of the coin. Here, "Monsters" are the disgusting beautiful creatures, while humans are the sadly ugly creatures of complacency. We soon learn that we were wrong all the time. By far my favorite achievement of the often under-utilized Craig Sheffer and the added bonus of David Cronenberg as "Decker" is a cast that is best seen when believed. The "monsters" are exhibited flawlessly by a host of English creators, many of whom also brought the "cenobites" to life in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who just needs a little (something) more out of their horror story. This is Clive Barker at his best.
