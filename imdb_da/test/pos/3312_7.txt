Although dated, this movie is definitely worth seeing. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life ... I was just going to live in New York. It has great opening pictures of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning "Romance is still ... the best of all ..." competing with West Side Story. There is a pretty stylish performance at the world's real first supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry, Janice D.), but it's amazing eye-candy! It also gives a little insight into the American Moors at the end of 1950 - our obsession with (and suppression of) sex (at work, not less!), Romance and marriage before women's lib. It represents an era where New York was the finest, and a super-bitchy performance by Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
