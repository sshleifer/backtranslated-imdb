This was the very first movie I've ever seen in my life back in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 at that time and saw it on a drive-in theater. I didn't understand that this would be a classic at the time (I went to bed about 20 minutes in the movie). After watching it on TV with two of my other favorite movies Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to come on every year at the same time all - about 40, 50, 75 times I knew this was a movie that I would have as one of my favorites. The three films were the only living action that shows that I could see as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie, but rather an urban interest film.Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the wild Irish rose that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarters she attended, and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar to what happened in reality. If you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad I was around to see some of the riddles on the era.
