This film is basically a very well-produced production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It is always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change. This film concentrates on a group of German soldiers who, after the battle in the North Africa fight, are sent to Stalingrad in Russia, where one of the most infamous and bloodiest battles of World War II is being fought. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see the other side of this battle, as we always always see the Germans simply as "bad guys". In this movie, these "villains" are given a human face and a voice, enabling you to realize that the only true enemy of war is war itself and not necessarily those you fight against. In the beginning, it is a little difficult to concentrate on the film, because you always always have in mind that the Germans are the evil villains. But of course you get used to it quickly and you quickly adapt the Germans as the protagonists of the movie, and you begin to break yourself - and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told is, however, the best. It's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from one sequence to the other to the other. The film is not always logical in its storytelling and has suffered too many sequences that remain too vague. It is also most of the time quite difficult to keep the signs separate and see who is who. It does not always make this movie easy to see, but there are probably enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it a worthwhile and interesting, not just the most coherent. In this respect, Hollywood movies are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and have some nice looks and locations, even though the film was not even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good wartime atmosphere. The character is most interesting, but perhaps a little bit formal. But I do not know, for some reason formal figures always work fine in war movies and strengthen drama and realism. It also helps that they are played by well-cast actors. All the actors are not the most well-known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also a rather unknown actor at that time), but each one fits their role well and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> All in all, not the best or most consistent WW II drama around, but definitely worth a visit, because of its original approach to the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
