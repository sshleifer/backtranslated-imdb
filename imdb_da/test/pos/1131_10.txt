I must say that I thought the Greek show would be really ridiculous and stupid. Being part of a sorority, they didn't want the Greek organizations to look bad .... <br /> <br /> But I think Greek is fun. Yes, they have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity, but it's not mocking, but just sweet humor. All the characters are beautiful minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry like brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie Haha His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's room mate, the Dale game by Clark Duke, is also fun. It is definitely fun to look so tune in to season 2. I can't wait until it's back on !!
