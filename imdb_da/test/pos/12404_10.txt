I recently rented this video after watching "Final Ascent" by the same author. I wasn't prepared for how intense this movie would get. I found it engaging from start to finish, and rooting for teens getting away with their attempted crime. The ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence, but well done. I highly recommend this picture.
