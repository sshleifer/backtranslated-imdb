SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have commented on many silent films in recent months. Now I have no idea why I comment on Steamboat Willie, I think I was just desperate to comment on something, so I saw this, and now I comment on it. This or the course is one of the very first cartoons, and I think it's not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Mickey Mouse runs a steam box when Pete throws him off and he runs it. When they stop for cargo, Minnie Mouse tried to move on, but otherwise failed. Mickey gets her out of a crane. Then a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the straw on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say I think they used the goat as Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steam fight for instruments for the song. Then throw an angry Pete Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes the rest of the day. All in all, it is yet another groundbreaking quiet short film. I mean, it's the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. Also this is not the first cartoon with sound. I think there were two more before this. Either way, this movie is truly, truly groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he is about to cut. I mean, he throws a potato with a bird and can have brutally slaughtered it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> Recommended Movies: Plane Crazy.
