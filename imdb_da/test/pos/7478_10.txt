I loved this movie! Fantastic original and different! A solid, intense, hard core and exciting movie that has just the right print on (dark?) Humor. If you are tired of the typical, overdone, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, where many great explosions and terrible and unrealistic shoot em up gun battles that offend your intelligence we can take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters who are wonderfully original and trustworthy, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or performance in the movie. Skip Wood's movie is a breath of fresh air and I welcome his originality and effort, his film has the feel of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen brothers movie (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). This film grabs you in the throat and does not release, there is no dull or bubbly gum on this film. The only disappointment is that no one seems to know about it, everyone I have recommended it to, thanked me and shared my opinion on it. This movie is a welcome change / alternative from the canned Hollywood mainstream waste produced today, even with their big name actors, huge explosions, special effects and huge budgets. It's a terribly wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous, and raw (I think it's a good thing not to run a fake Hollywood Polish here). Thanks to everyone involved in making this movie happen, you did a great job!
