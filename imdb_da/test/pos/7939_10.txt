I watched this movie with a live performance by the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of the two things that certainly made the experience for me; Especially the song after the fight where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating. The other thing that stood out for me is the struggle for the ice itself, a little strategy struck thoroughly by the decision-makers of _King Arthur_ in 2004. Also the battle continues forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can't think of another propaganda film that makes the appearance of war less glamorous or rewarding. I'm surprised that Stalin liked this movie as well; I didn't want to go out and struggle to see it.
