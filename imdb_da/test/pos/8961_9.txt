I'm not so sure the accuracy is with this movie, but I can tell you that I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. Gusten's character, played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique but entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed, but managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive and happy to spend time watching the movie. It does not take time to understand what is going on and take you on a roller coaster of real human feeling. I thought I knew my story, apparently I didn't know it at all! I give this step 9 out of 10 and recommend it to all adults and young adults and the youngsters in their hearts, just not the young ones. But as soon as they are allowed to watch "r" rated movies, making it a priority.
