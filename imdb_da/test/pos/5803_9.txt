This show was so exhausting to see, and there are only two numbers of Drowned World and Paradise (not for me) where you can sit and just consider it all. The opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually exciting as Madonna enters the scene through a giant Swarovski crystal ball coming down from the ceiling, and the big screens behind it show pictures of horses galloping. Horses play a role in this show because Madonna falls off one. The infamous scene of Madonna on the crucifix is ​​in this show as a huge screen counts for 12 million, the number of how many African children are orphans due to AIDS. At the end, a website address for everyone interested in donating. We then go into the theme of the environment and again display pictures of politics and religion. There is an interlude and then the show begins again on the music in I Love New York and Ray of Light this part of the show is one of my favorites where the dancers make fun hand gestures. Towards the end, the song with the song Disco Inferno is mixed into the song, and the dancers make more of that presence known. The end is again full of energy as the show breaks up to the Lucky Star and Hung Up melodies and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Have you confessed?" comes up. The DVD is worth buying, and when it came out, the soundtrack to the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a good job with the recordings for this show, so it was in accordance with the style of the tours.
