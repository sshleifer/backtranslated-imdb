With its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and light on Kira's eye, it's again reconciliation. <br /> <br /> This relationship of focused protagonists trains the balance between first and fast love in the Second World War. Poems Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in the dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. <br /> <br /> Vera is ex and next sparkles each other, as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls tie and share. An easy look that works well in the era jumps along with just a few dips in tact. Would work well with French subtitles, but then I may have been in too many art house films lately.
