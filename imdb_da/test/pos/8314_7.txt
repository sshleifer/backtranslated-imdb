This documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well made. But I found myself seeing many of the pieces of turmoil. The movie generally took a pretty confident stand on everything it said and showed, but inevitably a lot of animal behavior, their interaction with each other, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, etc. Much of it is certainly guessing - sometimes guessing With reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guesses. But the viewer is never made aware of it. The film actually pretends to observe real dinosaurs and their real behavior, etc. It probably does better viewing than confronting the audience with mountains of disclaimers, but it just makes it a little too populist in my estimation.
