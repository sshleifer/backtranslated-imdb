This documentary tracks the origins and lives of the Zephyr skateboard team using original movie shots in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk) combined with interviews by team members and other influential people today. The first part of the film documents, how the "Dogtown" section of Venice, CA came, began back around the turn of the century when the city was created to be a Venetian, Italian European city. By the 1970s, the only remaining local attraction, the Pacific Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach of plenty of views and other dangers. The poor children who lived in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. Because the waves were scattered in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie covered much more about surfing than expected, which seemed like a bonus since I didn't really know much about surfing or skateboarding until I saw the movie. The soundtrack was not surprisingly good too. I also liked how these kids just followed their passion and generally ended up enjoying the experience. The parts that did not work so well for me were the drama they were trying to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overloaded sense of self-esteem (although this is only a left street setting from where they grew up). This is not to say that they did not have a significant influence, but only that it seems very likely that there were other factors as well. <br /> <br /> A note: My wife is more affected than most in nausea when film uses it, we refer to as "SpastiCam" (wiggling camera movements). This movie is often guilty, so if you are so hit, be warned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> Set on 5/11/2002.
