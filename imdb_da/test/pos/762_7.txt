I thought it was going to be a miserable movie, honestly, I think Rupert Grint, RON, acting in a film different from Harry Potter, was actually really hard to see. But when the movie started, it turned out that this guy has talent, I think, is the best actor in the HP trio, as a reference, have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or how about Daniel's acting? Both lack experience, even though they have traded in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben, his character is a very shy boy who is unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his supremacy mom and the abominable anger against his father who is unable to step up and confront his incredible wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while trying to remember Shakespearian sonnets is absolutely amazing! It also seems that many young people are wasted in religious nonsense actions.
