This low-budget crocodile film really delivers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by true events would mean a little if you smell with a fake kink crocodile, bad C.G.I. or an obvious study setting. Fortunately, none of the above is involved in this amazing, very realistic movie. The crocodile is genuine, there is no C.G.I., and the on-location film takes place in an actual Australian swamp. The actors were, of course, inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and they succeed. You can place yourself in their difficulties, which is testament to how realistically "Black Water" translates as entertainment. Highly recommended. - NOTE
