This was truly one of the most enjoyable offerings I've seen on television. He's just an incredible performer. His personality shines through in every song he does. I really wish this was available as an uncompressed DVD so I could see it over and over again without -beeps-for explicit language. I haven't had the chance to see him live, but that's something I really want to do now. I can't forget his backup singers. They really added a lot of stuff and humor to the show. With their campy-style and flamboyant dance movements, they truly complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were some more songs on his live CD, which is also incredible. It is refreshing to see someone like him perform. Just so incredibly personable and really, I really can't say enough good things about Dan and this show. Once again, I just wish this was available as an unknown DVD.
