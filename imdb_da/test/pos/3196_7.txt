This short was partly four of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a movie I rented from Netflix, but apparently originally a monthly movie series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the DVD full of advertising. So far, I've tried two of the Journal's DVDs and felt furious in the horrible way a viewer has to navigate the disc to watch the movies. Talk about an overproduced and overly complicated way to do this! While I have and will continue to see as many shorts as I can, I really doubt whether I will disturb the magazine because of these factors. <br /> <br /> Now, it might be because I didn't like the disk so much that I wasn't favorably devoted to this Portuguese animated card. This is certainly possible. But even though this is the case, I feel that the other reviews were too positive about this simple little movie. Some of the artwork was really nice - I liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3-D environments, as the camera went from a boring distant shot and dove to the city below. This was great and took some work. But for the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, it just didn't matter to me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I watched this movie again on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on 5/9. It was a pretty unappealing collection of art films. But this time I saw CAT's and MOON's story with a completely different soundtrack and boy made it a difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, it had a French accent narrator who spoke English in a film Noir style. While I usually hate duplication, this time it really made the movie. The story of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version (provided you understand English).
