The last of the successors who did not count Abbott and Costello met Frankenstein, who was more or less a spoof. This tally Dracula (John Carridine) takes a central stage and seeks a cure for his vampireism from a friendly doc (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) also appears and seeks a cure. The good doc succeeds in healing Larry's vvvolfism, but Dracula tricks doc and ends up polluting his blood and makes the good doc to a crazy lunatic.oh and constantly great Franky (Glenn odd) lies on a table pending his electricity repair so he can get some chaos. It was a bit of a short movie, about 70 minutes and some shift, but the action is there and the great actors are also there. Lionel wanting to appear as a police visit, here are some trivia, Lionel will show up in the son of Frankenstein, Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein meets the wolfman and Frankenstein's house. and then the one. If there was another in the series, they might have added the creation from the black lagoon to the line up, I give Dracula 8 houses out of 10.
