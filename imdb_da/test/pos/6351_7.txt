A touching love story reminiscent of 'in the mood for love'. With great emphasis on Chinese poetry and how this is used by Eastern people to communicate emotions to each other, the story focuses on a teacher who wants so much to be modelers as well as a good man and father. A senior student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface of his 20-year marriage and how he deals with the moral dilemmas facing him. A beautiful and moving story.
