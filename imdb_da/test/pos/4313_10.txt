NOBODY (1999) is a wonderful piece of Japanese noir. These are three employees who get in their way over their heads when their innocent, drunk cheapshots out of three other men spend a night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are much more deviant non-goodness than even the film, allow us to know, the living daylight comes out of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return to nature - only They accidentally kill one of the other guys! The remaining two evil ones then begin to systematically destroy everything that these poor foxes love, including their rapidly dwindling reason. Phaedra Video's DVD sleeve has a criticism quote that calls the movie "A paranoid street crime crime freakout!" or some of these, and the term more than applies here. Embroidery, tense, very violent and low-key (but still pretty) shot pretty much at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motives that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists (who to some extent deserve all the few!). I give it a 10.
