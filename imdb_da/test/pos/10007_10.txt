This movie is great because the fact that real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do a good job is as if they are almost alive again. Jia Hongsheng even plays an actor who finishes everything except music and drugs fighting for depression and searching for the meaning of life while angry at everyone, especially those who care most about him. There are moments in the movie that make you cry because the family especially the father did a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem, and why he does the things he does, for example, stay closed in a dark room or walk alone or go on bike rides. Others can watch the movie as boring, because it's just so true that it's almost like a documentary. Overall, this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie, his father did as well.
