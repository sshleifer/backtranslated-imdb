This is a special Stooge card that actually uses satire for slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short "borrowed" from a movie from the same year with Clark Gable was called "Men in White". It is basically about trainees and practicing trainees and their sacred cause of "duty and humanity". I saw it recently and treated it almost like the Stooge version, because it takes a little too seriously. In any case, "Men in Black" is so well written, directed and, not to mention original, it was nothing from Chaplin or any of the others that Motion Picture Academy nominated it at a price as the best short comedy from 1934 However, some smelly cards called "La Cucaracha" extinct it and stole the price. Some manufacturers' brother-in-law must have been at the Academy's voting department. "Men in black" poker fun on the whole concept of the medical business much like Marx Bros always did at this time. Don't be a reasonable comparison, but I can see Marx Bros in this brief. In fact, in their function "One day on the races" there is a scene where there are "medical things" going on and they cause anarchy as normal. My guess is that this particular short was judged by these lines and therefore why it was nominated in the first place. Really try it out: first see this card and then see "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with Marxes and see if there is not the same great quality of comedy.
