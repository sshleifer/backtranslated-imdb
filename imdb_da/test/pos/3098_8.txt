One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a crazy tale of how a tight intellectual board game could interfere with even the most carefully planned key economies. Such an uncompromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this lovely short. Two young men play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to former Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', where human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting. The difference in activities (natural = feeding baby, watering having, artificial = chess) may be significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast of this movie is between this relentless backdrop and the calm, serene chess game and the hard passions that the latter cause as accusations of cheating lead to a most undisturbed presence. The intellectual game becomes a serious physical scrap, just as the authors of the art makers are forever killed by the "gross" demands of the audience. <br /> <br /> What is most enjoyable about the movie is not necessarily this slapstick descent, but the way it is filmed prolongs it long after the initial joke is made; the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with something like attention, instead focuses on the set while we catch glimpses of throwing feet and loosening clothes. The film's refusal to edit is obedient, so humor seems to rise from anything other than the struggle, reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation, our inability to let go. What is special Brilliant is the denouement, as these upper class clubs are caught by the chamber, who chooses them as two villains as if he were throwing their ears. If masters are not expected to hold their place with decorum than anyone will have to do it for them.
