I saw this back in 99 and I remember loving it. Still to this day, I can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the slanted pitch. Unfortunately from 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I looked through the movie of an uncle's friend and came across this (he played Clive Kennard). Just after reading the description, I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to find out that it was not just a video or DVD release, but it has not yet been repeated. This is a huge shame, I ask you to repeat at least this amazing TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this movie that he could do more than just host a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans will love, and even those who are not so keen on the sport will enjoy the comic value of this. Yes this is a brief review, but there is not much to say except that this is an undervalued movie, deserves to be repeated or published on video / DVD, so ITV, myself and other fans of this movie ask you. Please think of one of them!
