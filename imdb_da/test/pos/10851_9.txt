A young woman leaves her provincial life for a new one in town, and she meets another woman with whom she falls in love. Their relationship becomes physically fast and they both believe they are soulmates until one day the provincial girl comes home to find a man in their bed. Her lover then shows her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men. Um, a little like Anne Heche and Ellen Degenere's stuff. Yet, the provincial girl, devastated and destroyed by this discovery, begins to discover what the real world is all about as she falls into the hands of all sorts of violent and sweet people in 19th century England.
