This is an exciting woman's drama that men can enjoy. The foundation follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor (hi, it's Hollywood) and a few other mistakes. Here is one of the few films where once great time producer Robert Evans (here beautifully depicts a rat with women) emerges. It also has a mature Joan Crawford and great support supports. Check it out.
