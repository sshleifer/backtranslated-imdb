The reason for this movie is as stupid as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a sign that could have been disturbed by the ridicule of history. He is evil and a wife clover. It's a character so far from his NYPD and LA Law roles that you could get. <br /> <br /> If you have believed he had the look and the plays to play the really bad boy role, she is your gift. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black mini-dresses and small black minidresses throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She has always had some of the biggest bones in the film's history. It makes the movie worth it for this leg admirer. <br /> <br /> For this reason I would buy the DVD only if it was available.
