It's a shame that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have pulled this amazing movie off the screen and thereby deprive the public to see some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into a movie. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the song voices for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge were dubbed this movie and it is used as one of the reasons why Gershwin does not want this movie ever released again. </ br /> <br /> Despite the shortcomings of the movie and the creative differences between Gershwins and Goldwyns, this film has some of the most notable performances ever made on the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey is particularly deserved of praise. <br /> <br /> This movie was the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn's swan song. It was also ironically Gershwin's greatest shame. Finally, it is a loss for the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. Because we can no longer see them at their best.
