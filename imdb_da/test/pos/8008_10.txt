Out of all the Bat movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and fun movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Even though it is very violent and darker, it is Batman that creator Bob Kane had imagined many years ago. Michael Keaton represents his role as the deity of Gotham City. This time he is up against two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and movie score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman fights the evil forces trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken looks good as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has a vicious plan on his sleeve. But of course Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components you have a movie that will blow you away. That's why you go to the cinema. It has everything. It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to lead the other successors. If so, I think the franchise will still be strong today. Batman Returns is a great experience for fans who like cool movies.
