Based on the manga (cartoon) of the famous artist Masamune Shirow, this animated feature was a little disappointment to me. The story is good, but the animation is only "OK" while it could / should have been mindblowing. The movie is IMO sufficient, but somehow seems flat and uninspired if you know what I mean. A wasted opportunity if you are considering that another work by Shirow, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered a classic in many respects. It sets new standards for Japanese animation and created a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". I consider it worth a rental unless you are a fan of Shirow and want it all. Check out the original manga which comes highly recommended.
