This movie has made me a rugby - and coach Larry Gelwix - fan. History's signs fell and fell before they began to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts. It was understandable and completely credible. Like life, there was no easy answer to the problems facing them all. Superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life. I wish there were more movies like this one. These days I see almost exclusively being true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction. In addition, this is inspiring and it does not teach us to give up on anyone too quickly.
