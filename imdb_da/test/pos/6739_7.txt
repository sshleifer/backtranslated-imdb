This is a gently funny comedy comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there are plenty of wisecracks to walk around, this is not one of the Neil Simon pieces where each character exudes one-liner jokes for 2 hours as they are guest stars on a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that emphasize history. <br /> <br /> The performances are good across the board, especially Blythe Danner as the mother (though she and Judith Ivey were strangely WASP-ish choices to play Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say he hits the right notes as the unpleasant, gawky and totally horned up teen storyteller / protagonist in history. <br /> <br /> The movie is very similar in tone to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is far more imaginative and fun than this one.
