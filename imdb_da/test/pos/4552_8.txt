Well, the day Rob Schneider throws himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by staring into the absolutely non-wanted "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm .... there wasn't a movie called Roadtrip, which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there is Deuce Bigalow: Man Gigolo followed by successor Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern Perhaps there will soon be Spiderman: European websites are Hotter. .... or not) I am writing about this very malignant movie (at the time of release). I was one of those maligners I have to admit. I hit my nose on it myself, while Chris Farley pushed cocaine up his nose, and the SNL caste fought through one of the worst seasons in their '94-'95 story, but Norm McDonald's anchorage despite it. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple after this period, and we realized that there was a dark future for the calibers of the Spade-Farley-Schneider Sandler films. But I saw this movie the other day, ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and couldn't stop laughing. Yes it is not very sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny being Manny), but his "Van Down By the River" motivational speaker shtick, claiming that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear appropriate clothes" or "use deodorant" more than twice a week "translates well here as the ever self-explanatory character who realizes that he is not the clearest, not the best, and can stand to lose a few pounds. The same he does his best to do what he needs. And David Spade just shuts off his carved one-liners, as he did for "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically puts Farley's self-esteem. There really isn't much more to say than that. I love one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a few quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is, but the other one is in their hotel beds, and Farley says to Spade, "Do you like baseball?". Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farley's says, "New York YANK's?" Anyway Farley makes his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
