"House of Dracula" is a good successor to "House of Frankenstein". There is not much action, but the action is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent doctor who gets bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion (Dracula actually received the transfusion to overcome his "disorder", but he speaks a hunchback nurse and then transfers the blood to the doctor.) . It turns out that Dracula really did not come to seek a cure, but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed, and Wolf is next on the path to a cure (which is successful). Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived shortly before they burn to death (calmly, the same trio came back in "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine again plays an eerie Dracula (Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the movie and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, as he often does at Universal Studios monster film. A keeper for your collection.
