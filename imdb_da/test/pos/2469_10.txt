The most intense and powerful movie I've seen this year. There have been other films before it dived into Vietnam Know, but nothing about this emotionally heartbreaking movie, like a typical American suburban family around 1972, comes apart in the seams and reveals the scars that Vietnam has left on our entire ours collective souls. The game is A ++++ great with all four actors (with Kathy Bates a stand-out) who gives easier performances. What is wonderful about this movie is that you do not take any pages, but understand all four signs and empathy with them, although all four have divergent views and needs. There are scenes here that are as powerful as family secrets and emotions are revealed (like the confrontation between son and mother) that make you feel emotionally drained and in tears of anxiety. I actually cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking end is an anesthetic! A very overlooked movie to be seen. I consider this 1996 movie a 10/10 a superlative piece. We especially recommended this day and age with again, our country was in a fierce war, our headlines shouting at atrocities and again, our young men and women are returning with deep psychological scars with their deep pain of deeds performed in honor. One should watch movies.
