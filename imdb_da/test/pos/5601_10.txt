The promise of Martin Donovan to play Jesus was honest enough to make me see the movie. Worth it; clever and fun without exaggerating it. The low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect, but ended up being a little too dull, and the end sounded more like a PBS program than Hartley. Still too many memorable lines and good moments for me to judge it hard.
