I must admit that I liked this movie much more than expected. Will Smith has the pure cut charm that you just can't help but like. The reason was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma". This guy Kevin James has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he was very well thrown into this movie. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she were to be an actor or model, then the casting could have left something that was wanted. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and wish she had a bigger role. But, saving the best at last, Eva Mendes stole more or less stolen. Her beauty and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had glued me to the screen when she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth checking out.
