Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria, and one blew me away with its style, colors and spooky history. I decided next to go with Opera as I was told it was one of his best. Man, I think I discover what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> Opera is about a young opera singer who gets his big break when the star of an eerie modern opera take on Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is understudy so she gets to do the part herself. Sin for her, there is a psycho after her that makes her see the brutal murders of her friends and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Wow, Id heard good things about this, but I wasn't ready for the level of grandeur that this movie would take me. Yes the movie has its shortcomings, which Ill comes to later. But mostly the movie blew me away. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not so full of colors as Suspiria. I expected to be a bit like suspiria in that department, but no to my surprise it had its own look. The film is somehow devoid of color. It has many in colors in specific scenes (like the masterful kitchen / living room order), where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but mostly the film has a gray and black tone throughout and I liked that it had its own characteristic. <br /> <br /> The real stars of this show are the incredibly well-known death sequences. Wow. Each scene of death was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences. These deaths were carefully designed to shock and make the most of their situations. Loved every second of them, there is plenty of blood and chaos here, but in style. I don't wanna spoil myself. <br /> <br /> There is the direction. Man, there are some really original and beautiful shots on this one. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this one. You thought Tarantino's shot in Kill Bill vol. 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber in the gun was original? Well this is the movie he lifted it from! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with specific scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the function of the function he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver, who is going to kill her, was influenced by Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of that. Anyhow, Tarantino references aside, this movie has some amazing camera shots, just as the scenes of the crows fly through the crowd in the opera house ... good stuff. And a major reason why Argentos will be one of my favorites. The action from most of the cast was okay, but the best was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The look in the eyes as the murders were committed was great. The rest of the casting was a little wood and stiff, but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were very few things I didn't like about this movie. First logic was thrown out of the window in some scenes. Especially those that involve Betty's reactions after seeing the murders. It seems to me that for a long time she continued her business and did not tell anyone about it all. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally murdering a loved one in front of your eyes ... you're not just going away from the murder scene and continuing your life. Someone would have linked her to the murders. She may even have become a suspect herself ... but no. The end is also a bit anti-climactic. You have to see this to understand, but it seemed a little unnecessary how the movie ended, it felt like it could be finished earlier. It would not have felt so superfluous. But it's about it, not really big problems for me, really since I enjoy the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I'm consuming every step of the way as if I were eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. These guys do really well. I think of his films as works of art, and I have only seen two of them! Can't wait to discover the rest of his movie. Argento, you man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
