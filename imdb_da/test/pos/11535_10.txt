I can't understand for my life why the rating here for this movie is so low. This was one of the most beautiful movies I've seen this year. It really hit a chord with me. I had been waiting for this movie for several months and I thought to myself that it is not possible to live up to the expectations I had for it ... look like I built it up in my head as much as I did did. Needless to say, it not only meets my expectations, but it far exceeded them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Their action is fantastic. They were both in their element and completely natural to the roles. The sites were absolutely gorgeous. Each movie recorded was perfectly taken and fits well with the atmosphere and atmosphere. I found this movie very touching and took it very close to the heart. I would even consider saying that this could be one of my favorites all along. At least I could probably see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I couldn't find a mistake in this movie. It's hard to say about any movie. I would highly recommend this one. It touches, it's meaningful, and it says a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Well done by everyone.
