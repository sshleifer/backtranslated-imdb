Challen Cates does a wonderful job depicting a conflicting break, struck down by the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she believed she would have in college (inspired by a famous author) and The security of her waiting marriage with a man she really loves. This movie is definitely worth watching --- as predictable as it may be, the play is inspirational and there is real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
