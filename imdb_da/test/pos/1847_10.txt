This is one of the movies that has everything in it. I don't think I'll be tired of seeing it. Hopefully, more movies like this will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a way, the song by Engelbert Humperdink sang "I must never say goodbye", the song has come to life. You will definitely laugh and cry in the whole scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think it's worth seeing and your heart will glow. It would be nice to have fun with your "treasure"; Sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. There is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expressions are available throughout. In fact, at times you will even think that you are part of that family or they are part of yours. See it!
