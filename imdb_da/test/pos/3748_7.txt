Is it a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, exciting, scary and so amazing, actually touching, when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> Yes, what the lurks in the maze, turns out to be a surprise, and for many people, a fun. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written and actually has some basis. Not that it will ever result in what we see in the film of course. But working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers - and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented - creates a very scary mood that was oddly convincing. At times, the film is of course very stupid, but it has its moments.
