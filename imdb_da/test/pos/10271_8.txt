A flat production that keeps the interest from the very first scene where Max chooses a ring in a jewelry store. Much of the following reminds us of Shakespeare's "A Mid-Summer Day Dream", where Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. Here Max and Lucien both tend to love at first glance being mixed with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the merry mix, Max tends to get involved in events that bring back memories of two years ago. And because Max has many of these dreamy episodes, we are exposed to a flashback after the other, for many in my opinion, because at first viewing of the movie I was not entirely sure I was in the present or the past. There is a lot of running down corridors, stairs, through doorways, in elevators etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced movie, but should we have as many people collide with each other? After four collisions, it ceases to have any effect if you apologize for the pun. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but I wonder how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person's intention of suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is also in this movie when Max almost expires at the same time. But a kiss or two makes him feel better. If you manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you will finally find yourself at the airport, where Max's devoted sister gives him a most loving kiss. One can say it is she who solves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Mid-Summer Night's Dream".
