Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and cameras in the industry, so it should not come as a surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect movie recording of the most boy-historical story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video screen, I would have turned Pierre on within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be the self-absorbed and the stupid, both at the same time, except perhaps Heathcliff in Emily Bronton's Wuthering Heights. After using 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry with the main character. Okay, after saying that, Pola X is a great movie with one of the few frankly sex scenes I've ever seen in any movie .... which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking ... and I'm talking graphic here by the way. However, Pola X will throw you out of the hell so make sure you're ready for it if you decide to see it.
