Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a runway in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. When the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the runway, past the concessions and over the rink into a small bandstand, where a small band makes their sound control. It's a track shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's peculiar face, pointing to rapture as he grabs the headphones and talks to a man who puts this tape on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key. He must somehow show the passion Holly had for his music to do the film work. This is a rock-and-roll story without lines of cola hunted with shoots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. It's not about a man with multiple women choosing from a sex-scandalized, abandoned lusty tragedy. This is a movie about a lovely Texas boy who respected his parents and attended church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds it sparkle and ignites it, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays the guitar in the movie and sings, it's not overdubbed with Holly's footage. Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies, a fighting actor and so much or more so a fighting rock musician too. Thus, he gives a good performance, because even though he is not Buddy Holly, he is in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old Les Paul classic, "Mockingbird Hill," and he has landed the land to nail it. Then a kid calls for some bop and against his two bandmates (in fact, the crickets were 3 guys, but the cut is fine for the movie's limited tale) he leads them to cry in "Rocking with Ollie Vee". The kids love it and the parents hate it. DJ on the rolling rink beats it, and it is later released in New York without Buddy Holly even knowing it was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie filled with humorous moments. An amped-up disk jockey from Buffalo calls up Buddy at home. The DJ has played "That's the Day" for 12 hours and goes to 24. The police strike at the station's barricade door. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is very excited. He tells the boys and their meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist rounds the band out fine and has good chemistry with each other. There are problems but not overwhelmed drama found in most rock (all?) Biopics. The movie does not manipulate you either. Your emotions are hovering, but they are not manipulated. When the Crickets step on the Apollo scene in Harlem, the first white group ever to play there, tear into an electrically charged performance of "Oh Boy" and win the audience over, my rock and roll loving ass was strangled and crying. Next, Busey and the boys "make it so easy" sound funkier and more soulful than I would have thought possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone with uniform knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and Big Bopper too young. We as the audience know it, but the film is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we almost forget it immediately. The film is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The movie ends with its last performance, and it's a good fifteen minutes Busey rocking out obsessed with the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was glad to hear him finish it on "Don't Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The film freezes before the final credit with the crash information, but I hardly noticed it. I was still thinking how good the last song was.
