I agree with all the previous commentators - it is simply the best of all scary comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe ever, and certainly with a more beautiful face (maybe there is less mystery, but see how Marilyn paid for it .) I do not think I have ever seen such a succulent look on the screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me was excited about it - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if the idiots do really want to do their convert-a-queer number, they really need to upgrade their standards since no church mouse needs to apply here ...) Her boobs, the rest of her figure, her lovely voice, the fun way she shakes when she goes over a room ... just to come up with a man, breasts are literally breastfeeding as in exquisite confrontation ... I think Boyer is one of the greatest leading men in film history. No one played opposite to several great female stars than he: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and here Bardot among many others. And he was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Caron, and had small parts in 'How to steal a million' with A. Hepburn, as well as being in the Deneuve movie 'The April Fools' (though she's not the opposite). The only thing I could disagree with is that even the loud, unpleasant music over the opening circles is appropriate - Bardot is not supposed to be subtle on top of everything else and her essential volume (I don't mean her voice) is a part of her irresistible and you can even say exemplary charm. Vidal is very good looking, though pudy Brigitte says to the beginning: "I don't know why I am in love with you, you are not even beautiful." <br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardot! century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly characterful pass so quickly in all her eccentric glory.
