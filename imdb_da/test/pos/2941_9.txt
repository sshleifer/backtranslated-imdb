Yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE !!! It's so entertaining, and I have the absolute greatest time to see it. Earlier since Cycle 1, it has been good, and I have not noticed a decline in honesty AT ALL.Tire Banks that you know are the host, and as wonderful as she is, there are also the other judges and co-hosts like J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show is for every girl invited to become America's Next Top Model, to work her way to the top by completing and winning photography competitions. It sounds good, it doesn't, and let me tell you it's good !!!! It's great to see all the different kinds of photo shooters the girls take, and each is different, cool and bold. Anyone who hates this show has no idea and I will tell you that this show will be on for a long time, so treat it !!!
