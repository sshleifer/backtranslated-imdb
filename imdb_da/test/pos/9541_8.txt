This almost perfect cinematic representation of Edith Nesbit's popular children's novel follows Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis, and Peter, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to jail. They go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country, which is close to a railway line ?? Mother writes stories to make money for food and candles, while children spend much of their time around the station and specifically waving to a particular train to 'send their love to father'. <br /> <br /> Already an engaging and clever novel, the people here are alive under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the Railway Man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train). "The Railway Children" is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. When we see Bobbie grow up with worries at an absent parent screaming at her own needs, both for being alone and having fun, we can only rejoice when the events come together at the end of the picture. Throughout, we have a sense of time and place ?? be it from the steam trains, the university's paper hunt or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).
