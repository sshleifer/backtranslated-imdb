Okay, so I love stupid movies. If you enjoy stupid sci-fi movies, the best movies or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I'd watch this movie. This movie is all I wanted to be. Being a fan of the best movies fits this bill. Every time I thought of myself "this movie would be the cutest, best movie ever if * blank * would happen ...." So as I thought it would, * blank * would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b' movie. If you're a fan of Campbell, I'd say 'see it', take your friends, laugh at it. It is fun. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's on one night, watch it. It has become a movie for me that I wanted to file under "indulgent film". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard working day I could come home and see (this list also includes 'harold and kumar, go to white castle', 'dark army' and 'intolerable cruelty') <br /> <br /> If you fancy an over-the-top, wonderfully bad movie, watch this. If not, rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
