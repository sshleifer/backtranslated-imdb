If I had only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten foot pole. But after I had heard some positive buzz and knowing that it was doing some noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got is a really fun movie based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as a nurse 'Betty, a woman sent for a misleading psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by the foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film runs continuously between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. However, despite this apparent identity crisis, it is pretty good. I found my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish always waiting for the next twist in history. The whole cast is strong, if not spectacular. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash some years ago with the very impressive and dark of the Company of Men ') relied heavily on many clipped Hollywood conventions. The mood-creating musical effects he stuffed into our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And he made the standard old "let's take some of the lowercase letters and pair them at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance" trick, just to make sure everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why should directors and writers treat their audience as idiots ?? <br /> <br /> However, the film is still very enjoyable to be pulled very far by these annoying irritations. In a very sub-year of film, 'Nurse Betty' is one of the more pleasant surprises in 2000. 8 out of 10.
