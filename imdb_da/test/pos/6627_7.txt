Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife called Jan and Eva. They live on an island working as farmers. There is a war going on and soldiers are beginning to attack people on the island. When the war wears off a little Jan and Eva is arrested as joining the opposite side. When released even more problems follow and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of the CEC Award for Best Foreign Films at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at The Guldbagge Awards, the NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at National Agency Of Review and The NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Movies at the National Society of Film Critics Awards. Shame, have good direction, a good script, good performances by both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good filmography and good production design. Shame, is a well-functioning and well-founded story of how people in a desperate situation sometimes do what they can to survive. The film has a strong message and is a good movie. The reason why I do not rate this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece such as. Other Ingmar Bergman films such as Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona. The film did not have as much influence on me as I thought it would, and it lacked Ingmar Bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialogue. While it's not close to being one of his best movies, there's still a lot to like about Shame, and it's a good movie. I would have just wanted it more than not to have seen some of the other Bergman masterpieces.
