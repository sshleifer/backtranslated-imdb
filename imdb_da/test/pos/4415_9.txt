I was a junior in high school when "Flesh" hit the big screens but was fortunate to see it at midnight movie houses in NYC just two years later. Meat is the first part of a so-called "trilogy" of films featuring Joe Dallesandro as an object of desire. It bears the name "Warhol", but is more Paul Morissey's work. Essentially, the story is about the yields that surround a day in the life of a street-wise male hustler (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, handsome and a little naive ... but he manages to bring the bacon home to his wife, for reasons that should not be fully appreciated. <br /> <br /> Of particular note to movie buffs is that this movie (along with the remaining two of the trilogy) had no script in itself. Warhol's superstars were just given a premise ... and the words and actions the viewer sees are quite natural (even at times ridiculous or non-sensual). But all in all, it seems ... "Rolling Stone" noted in its review that the movie was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a movie of the same year, polished by Hollywood (an Oscar winner for Best Film) with big name talent (I also admire the movie) ... but FLESH, who was improvised, was somehow more intense and realistic without the need for complex underplots and any cause for celebs .. or for that matter any cause whatsoever! <br /> <br /> The movie broke more than $ 3 million and was an absolute feeling, especially on the German market (which, ironically, believed they got a "censored version" of the movie due to post-editing ... see note below). <br /> <br /> Curiously, the movie is "cut and paste" with "pops". "click", "blink", and the dialogue is literally interrupted from the center of the sentence. It's almost as if Warhol / Morissey indicates a simple truth that it's a superstar's "day of life" extract for your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than previous Warhol works with 8 hours of sleep and the Statue of Liberty as a 20+ hour film. FLESH is, in my opinion, the first of the Warhol films that is actually digestible (given a broad pallet) and Warhol's / Fabrik's first legitimate answer to the Hollywood phenomenon "stardom". <br /> <br /> As the first of a "trilogy," it depicts a young, desirable male icon, naive, in-demand, response to invitations to delight his family. Subsequent films would show "same character" with a different set of values. (See "Trash" and "Heat")
