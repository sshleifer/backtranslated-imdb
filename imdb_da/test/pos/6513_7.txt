"Miss Cast Away" is an entertaining trifle that excludes serious drawing or character development to pack as many gags as possible. Most enjoyed with a large audience open to such entertainment and perhaps having a few drinks. Most of the jokes are current events, so in the future this movie can become a time capsule of pop culture references from the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The conversion of 30 to 24 p recordings creates a jerky look in some parts, most notably the open air shot. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Micheal Jackson is actually a strange non-sequiter event. But first of all, I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown a useful interest in one of his protégés, even after he (the director) has left the sweet-preteen-boy scene. <br /> <br /> Effects work is not as bad as a review suggested. Most of it was made by a one-man crew for a short period of time consisting of animator William Sutton whose name appears to have been omitted from the IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps fill the gaps in this movie. I hope he finally got paid!
