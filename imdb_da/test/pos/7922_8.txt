(Warning: spoilers! - Although it's hard to destroy this movie by telling story details.) Eisenstone's black and white propaganda movies are not for everyone. It is very old and it is, clumsy. What makes it good for me is the soundtrack, not the original, but the updated soundtrack. Even better is the orchestral version Prokofiev created (my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and Chicago Symphony). The movie is actually fun in places. It is reminiscent of the old "Midsummer's Dream". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. It is also for the warrior chick Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) This is the world's best collection of films of pithy Russian proverbs (there are tons of them - they make up the majority of The spoken lines). The fighting sequences actually look much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flixes. These guys are so clumsy with their battles that real peasants would be. The weapons look ugly, so the actors are probably trying to avoid hurting each other. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the German "grand marshall" tries * really * hard to see frighteningly early in the movie, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. After being caught, he looks * so * pathetic. (Speaks volumes about the intended audience, then?) A truly humorous touch is that the German army brings a * body * with it, played by a character in a black cloak. Watch the Russians bring this guy down * while he is playing. <br /> <br /> After the match is over and almost all Germans have died, the best part of the movie (and the music) comes, the song sang to the dead soldiers who are dead, defending the motherland. This part is so sad it is almost an anti-war declaration. Ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film. Wonder why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic - he killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia who carry a sword will die of the sword."
