Now, the film is essentially about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghanistananitan before the main action in 1985. The film shows exactly the wicked realities of the Russian army that have made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and NCO) is physical harassment, strokes and humiliating younger recruits), the mixed nature of the war (you can trade a day with your enemy and kill him next time), women's life in the front line, documentary of helicopter assault, and coffins are soldered and sent home in heave C -130 Hercules class Russian cargo aircraft with traces to jam Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war attitude, emotional side simply set. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly finished, and often they are illogical, like Major Bandura's suicide attack and returning to 10-year-old armed with AK-47, the father he has just killed. Also the fact that in the middle of the fire in the mountains jumps out of nowhere (and every half person knows that it is almost impossible to bend 40-50 ln paychecks on March any). But at the same time, films show that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes condoned, undisturbed destruction of entire villages, too little or no reason is normal, killing civilians overlooked as injuries inevitably during the war is incalculable ... Some foods for to think about why Afghan war is lost. Not the best war movie, but deep and intelligent enough to be worth seeing.
