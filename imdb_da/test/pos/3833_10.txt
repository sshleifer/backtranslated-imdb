Despite the entire hoopla about THE PROBLEM WITH TRIBBLES episode, BALANCE OF TERROR may just be the best episode of the series. And although I've always loved a piece of the action because it's so much fun, I really have to vote for this Romulan episode to be the very best. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie as it slopes back and forth between the carved Romulan ship and Enterprise as it seeks to destroy Romulans before they slip back across the neutral zone after an attack on the federal records. In so many ways, the notion is much like the film UNDERNE WHERE - where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in the opposite, as they both try to overcome the other - and in the process develop a disgusting respect their enemy. Interestingly, only a short part of the episode's beginnings take place on a planet - and that is great because an episode on the ship could have been easily static and boring. But because the writing was so amazing and the protagonists wrote and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Strangely, for the bold Trekkers out there, they recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is just a big and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
