The timing of this film that was released could not be better, especially in the face of all the turmoil in this world today. The film is a heartwarming, endearing and witty piece. If you have siblings and still have parents alive, it will hit the home well for the viewer. If you have lost your parents, it will touch you deeply. Laughter often comes, the ensemble thread works very well together and is credible. This film is intelligently written, and the lines coming from each of the actors make the viewer laugh aloud. There are moments that also bring tears to the eyes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can follow an intelligent movie.
