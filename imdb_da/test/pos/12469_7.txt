I really liked the first part of this movie in Africa for about an hour or so until animal cruelty from civilized people in Scotland came to me in the second half and made me so sorry I couldn't see anything of it . But this was done by the film maker to make a point that early natural scientists destroyed everything alive, they did not understand by "studying" it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the examined animals which we now know should not be studied everywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as discreet as possible. I recommend this movie as it was a most serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the bullfinch that was fierce in the 19th-century scientific world, as well as the pure and simple, beautifully primitive life, Tarzan lived like a young man found as a baby and raised by chimpanzees after his parents' violent death in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life in the Tarzan role, which was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's ultra-slim, noble-reeking gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty good as Tarzans gussied-up and civilized "Jane" in his first movie role. From his charismatic work in this movie and his very frightening eyes, I do not understand why Lambert did not later become a big star, but his really bad movie choice may later have made him in. Tarzan, who then escorted Tarzan back to his former unknown ancestral home in Scotland, was great as always. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy Tarzan got sick and didn't stay in the animal noise civilized world at that time and went home to Africa to live his life with his gentle and loving monkey "relatives" who raised him in Instead of living in Scotland and living like royalty, that would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first.
