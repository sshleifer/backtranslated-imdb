I think this movie didn't get the recognition it deserves because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say that the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is only a snapshot of the man, the story of his life extended far beyond the years that were touched by the film. This is a deep film, a reflection on modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study of the man whose thoughts (and others who used him) have certainly affected our lives. There are some films that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way. The story brought the day, and the actors did their job. Good work for them, I say.
