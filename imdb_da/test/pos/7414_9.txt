Where in the world this film is no longer recognized, is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I picked it up to Â£ 1 and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent on a movie. What normally leaves movies about the club scene is either the music or the actual scenes recorded in the club country. <br /> <br /> Here, the music and club scenes are completely credible, using some great tunes of the time, and filmed in real clubs, where people actually look like they will be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of a high standard throughout the round, although Jason Donovan stands out especially for me (he played Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Show in London at about the time this may have been filmed, So his pulling phase was in full flow!) And of course Tim Curry, who is eloquent drug country boss is convincing. <br /> <br /> Simply say, if you are a fan of British movies, watch this, it doesn't matter if you are in clubs, as the movie is strong ugh as a story anyway. <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
