I rented Boogie Nights last week, and I could tell you when I saw the movie, I had a blast. If you think that when you watch the movie you get sick of the porn. I mean yes, if you are not a pornographer who does not like to know it than this is not the movie to see. But the thing is, the whole movie isn't about porn. Halfway through the film is about the porn industry, but the other half is about character development and the bad situations that these characters go through. The actors played the role perfectly, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes are of course fantastic, but focus especially on the character's hype in porn movies until they fight. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedeens Outlook: 10/10 **** A +
