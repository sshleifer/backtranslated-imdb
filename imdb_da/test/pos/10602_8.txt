When I first heard about this movie, I was easily interested. The reason seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and instructor seemed like something that could be good. When I found out the movie star Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested (I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was on ... Yes, I'm the lame). But I didn't have much faith that it was too good. When I sat down to see it, I was afraid I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even in just five minutes, it became clear that I had been wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this movie was pretty idiotic and definitely not suitable for any kind of people. The action was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was pretty easy to relate to Ryan's character, giving the movie a credible center. This is the key in a movie as monstrous as this one (and that's probably why I wasn't a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The movie is not at all suitable for younger people, DUH, and will surely create more than a fair share of awkward turtles if you look with parents. But it's a good one for you and your friends on a movie night.
