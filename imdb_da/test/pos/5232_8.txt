My giving this movie a score of 8 is compared to other feature-length movies from 1930. According to film standards made a few years later, this movie could only get a score of only 6 or 7 - mainly because the sound quality was so poor . Now it is possible that the movie sounds better, and the Fox Movie Channel showed a broken print (it had many lines and scratches), but I suppose the sound problem was always a problem. This is because sound in film was still a novelty in 1930, and many of the 1930's Hollywood speeches sounded horrible - with background characters often drowning the leaders, the characters shuddered together to make sure they were picked up by microphones or inconsistent quality (like what seen in BISKOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other films from the day). This was all made much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was shot outside - something unheard of at the time. Totally innovative, but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound engineers! So even though the movie was very hard to listen to, I realized they were going to start somewhere, so I can forgive this - especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking - a great innovation for the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Reason is similar CIMARRON - a western who came out the following year and who caught Oscar for best picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not so big a movie, and I actually like THE BIG TRAIL more because of the film's scope. While some may be in BIG TRAIL's slow pace, I saw it as a great history lesson on the difficulties that Westerners travel on lanes. Plus, it all looked so beautiful when director Raoul Walsh went to great trouble filming on the spot, and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a movie version of some Ansel Adams prints. <br /> <br /> As for the actor, it was pretty good. This was a great break for young John Wayne - as his former screenplay was at best smaller and infinite. Here he was led and did a dandy job - although of course he was young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than he was in later movies, when his screen staff were not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (Tyrone Power's father). He looked nothing like his extremely beautiful son and looked and sounded almost like Bluto from the Popeye cartoons! He made very few sound films - die just a year after making this movie - so it is a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor. All in all, the film is worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few far too long scenes here and there. For the 1930s, it was a remarkable achievement - more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON made the following year. Much for the reason that BIG TRAIL doesn't win an Oscar most likely was because ALL STILL ON THE FRONT FRONT came out that same year, and it's really one of the big movies.
