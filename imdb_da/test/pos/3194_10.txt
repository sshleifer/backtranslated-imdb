I'm a new convert, you might as well say. I borrowed DVDs from my local library. I have been interested in the samurai since to see "The Last Samurai." My father told me he used to see Shintaro when he was a kid. He said it was pretty good. We are up to series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a little getting used to the doubled English voices over the characters speaking Japanese, but I really enjoy it all the same. It is a little strange to see the small breaks when the ninja stars are thrown into signs, and they hold onto a tree or a wall. I wasn't used to it, but I'm now. But I suppose it's the technology they had in the 60s. I have noticed that Shintaro is kind, kind, willing to help them in distress, he is very humble, he doesn't make much of his time himself (he only says he's better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is really interesting to see the swordmanship that Koichi Ose has. It is fantastic. This series is for anyone interested in samurai.
