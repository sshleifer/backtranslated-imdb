Ever since I was allowed to play Goldeneye again, it has been impossible to get it to think about it. I'm surprised I could have gone without it. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest games at all times. I've never played any other shooter games, but I know this one is foremost. Most people owe it too much violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be a few graphic antics, but there are far worse out there. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, it's fun. With an amazing arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you will go through several challenging levels from the movie, completing important targets and warding off swarms of guards. There are plenty of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill. Goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games ever. You can pick more characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. Chances are you and your partner will laugh as hard as you blow each other away, so you will look like Bart and Lisa Simpson see an episode of Itchy and Scratchy show. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't played, don't rent it: just buy it. It is too good to be true. For cool Goldeneye stuff, check out the Detstar.com Goldeneye website. Every James Bond lover will dig this game big time.
