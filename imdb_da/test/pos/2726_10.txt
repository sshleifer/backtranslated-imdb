Occasionally one crosses a movie that forces one to think about the community's reaction to people who differ from their definition of normal. Mitthi has suffered in the hands of non-social elements that stand alone to cope with her tragedy retreating to her idyllic world .... one who, according to her, is the real world ..... Surreal (the world of Mitthi) overlays on the real (her family). <br /> <br /> Mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to rethink our priorities of trying to rehabilitate "patients" like them. Do we have the right to withdraw them to our reality when all we have to offer them in ours is pain and suffering? What right do we have to deprive them of their source of happiness? What right should we remove their joy when we cannot help them in their grief? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best movies on social issues ... showing us the need for any patient to need empathy and not simple sympathy.
