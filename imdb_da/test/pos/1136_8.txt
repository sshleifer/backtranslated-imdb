When I first heard of "Greek", I figured I'd see it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of the ABC family's so bad-the-almost-good shows. But tune in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode much more than we had expected. As a member of a Greek community, I can say that many of the stereotypes raised here are those that come up almost every time someone begins to talk about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And is also very fun to play with just on is own, let alone watching on a TV screen. The opening scene chopped into a slightly-dramatized version of the preparation for an actual formal rush in some sororities, and it continued from there. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for hypersensitive Greeks. If you are offended even in jokes about things that are not so great about Greek life, then you will spend the whole of the first episode, and probably many others, cringing and shouting. But everyone else should have lots of fun watching it. It is nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing is ever.
