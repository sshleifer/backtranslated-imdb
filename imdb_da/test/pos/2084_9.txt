Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave this a frightening, expressionist look. Scenes are shot at strange angles - especially scenes involving figurative and literal lady-kills Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior presents another super film, "The Stepfather", with more than two decades. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is excellent, but it is hard to believe by Joyce Compton as anyone than the singer in "The Awful Truth.") Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and even if you play one older woman looks beautiful) - they could not have been topped. <br /> <br /> Setting a creepy lodge-in-house-of-women's history against a psychiatric background is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. Nothing corny at all. It is not at all majestic. <br /> <br /> The decision is a little pat, unfortunately. Don't Emerson come with Bennett. It makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I think he is more like a Mr. Ripley's character, who could have avoided everything - botulism, the murder scene, the jealous sisters - and disappeared into the great world beyond this story. It would not have prevented the secretary's essentially happy ending, and her boss finally came together.
