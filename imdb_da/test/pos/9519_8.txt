Wow .... it's been a long time since I last saw such a fun movie like this !!!!! I've never been a big fanatic of French movies, but since I fell in love with the beauty and play of Catherine Deneuve, I decided to watch all her movies ... but I didn't think this would be as amazing as it turned out. Luckily I bought it even though I had doubts! This is really "feel-good-time" movie with class and quality. There are some great social issues and moral dramas involved that are very close to today's modern lifestyle, which is very beautiful and realistic. I also liked the dance scene in the men's room a lot! But my favorite is Catherine Deneuve's rather cautious attempt to sing ..... she brings it as she is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! Furthermore, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a great role (I didn't even know she acted .... I only knew her for her music). So don't wait any longer and watch the movie ... you'll be surprised in many ways.
