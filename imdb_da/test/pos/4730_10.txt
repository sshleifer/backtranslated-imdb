After reading about this documentary, I rented it and saw it with my teenage children. It was incredibly well-balanced and showed each side's perspective and left many questions unanswered. It is as it should be. I'm not looking at a documentary to be told what to think. I see it to learn and draw my own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Then we took a trip to Waco and visited Branch Davidians on site for the conflagration. This was a strong lesson in seeing for yourself. And it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind "Waco: The Rules of Engagement." If you just open your eyes and see, facts can speak for themselves.
