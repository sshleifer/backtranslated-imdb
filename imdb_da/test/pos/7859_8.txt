This super creepy South Gothic melodrama stars Clint Eastwood as a wounded Confederate Civil War officer, taken by a rural girls school and used to back to health. A strange veil of sex follows, as the supposedly "dangerous" man falls prey to a group of seemingly harmless women, who turn out to be as brutal as the men war against each other on the front. This is a classic spider and flight history, but here is a single flight and a whole bunch of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the school's main mistress, and she gives a distinctive sensational achievement. Side was trained as a theater actress and it shows in all her performances. Whatever role she played, she always committed herself 100% to it and never let herself fall out of character. So it is here, with this deadly spider, taking her sexual oppression out on this helpless man. Each of the other girls also reacts to him in his own way. The two most prominent are the meandering girl who can't wait to get on him and the virgin (played by anyone other than the skinny Elizabeth Hartman?) Who seems like she would fall into a dead, weak if anyone saw much as said the word "penis" to her. The schematic Madonna and whore history seems to be heavy-handed if the film did not keep you so off-kilter and then completely unsure what would happen next time. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in film for me arose when the group of women performs an amputation of Eastwood's legs that have been infected with the gangrene. Again, the spider / flying allergy is clear: they are bumping him so it is so much harder for him to escape their web. <br /> <br /> A classic chiller. Not a good movie, but a morbidly entertaining one. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
