This flick was the introduction for many of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. It was because it was easy to find. It was in all public domains in the VHS era, and before it became a late night tsv. cool classic, double knee thighs relax. Besides, how are you opposed to the title? For lazy comers, a brief explanation for it's profit: Florida Wheeler negotiates K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror movies, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them on the drive in. The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with; American borders and accepted horror movie conventions were cheerfully ignored. Large, beautiful sets of designs and lighting were placed next to strange or ridiculous special effects. Nothing in Hollywood was as close as it was out and about strange. Now, in Catholic influenced social conventions, Mexican folk music and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add to the English scripts they were encoded for. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted words to match the movements of the actor's lips on display, not the literal translation. As a result, the American soundtracks tended to run from flood to down right loopy. There is even a fan site for Murray that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. The first time the viewers of the films complain about pacing, the purple prose, the production values ​​and being told it is SUPPOSED to be that way. While people are laughing at enjoyment over things that are usually considered fatal movie errors. Everything must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it. <br /> <br /> This was made back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; AZTEC MUMMY AND CURSE OF AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3-disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on the one hand, the original Mexican production on the other. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Many times, when the original Spanish is not much more. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long feedback that brings you faster on the previous episodes. A kind of continuity was thrown out of window at number two and it is downhill from there, logically wise. You won't even get The Angel back or any mention of him in this last episode. Names, places, even family trees change between movies. After a while, start LOOKING for continuity changes. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the series crook Doc Krupp is quite pungent, sour, sour, almost dull with dementia and will still steal the Aztec breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another great editing of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show and wandering into the darkness of her nightie to help find the doggone breastplate again. The mummy is nothing happier with this when he was last time. The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this because it looks as if the grips came up with it between taking a slow afternoon when the right costume went through. No. <br /> <br /> this was planned. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller running off. X box where were you when Krupp needed you ??? Robot LOOKS killed at the end, but actually came back in two more Mexican films. It had a FAN BASE .. All in all, a fun quirky finish for a three movie series. Sit back and enjoy.
